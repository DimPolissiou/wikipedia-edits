It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. According to [[Herodotus]], Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow \"upwards towards heaven\", saying as he did so: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say \"Master, remember the Athenians\" three times before dinner each day.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh5100.htm Herodotus Book 5: Terpsichore, 105] \"...he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when he had been informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it and placed an arrow upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards heaven, and as he shot into the air he said: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Having so said he charged one of his attendants, that when dinner was set before the king he should say always three times: \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"</ref>\n\nAt the time of the battle, [[Sparta]] and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for [[Attica]], landing in the bay near the town of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message to the Spartans asking for support. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.\n\nThe Athenians and their allies chose a location for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|Persian cavalry]] from joining the Persian infantry. [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian forces, composed primarily of missile troops. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his centre. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] restarted the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.\n\nThe Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to have begun at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks that they were able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This victory was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them.

However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.<ref name = h47>Holland, pp. 47\u201355</ref><ref name = h58>Holland, pp. 58\u201362</ref><ref name=\"h203\"/> Moreover, the Persian King Darius was a [[usurper]], and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.<ref name = h47/> Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] to become [[Achaemenid Macedonia|a vassal]] of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}}  Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of ancient Greece may have been inevitable.<ref name = h58/> However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.<ref name = h171>Holland, 171\u201378</ref> Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.<ref name = h171/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref>\n\nThe Ionian Revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].<ref name = h154>Holland, pp. 154\u201357</ref> In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.<ref name = h154/> The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.<ref name = h154/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.98 V, 97]</ref> Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.<ref name = h157>Holland, pp. 157\u201361</ref>\n\nThe involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.<ref name = h157/>\n\nIn 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.<ref name = V65>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.65 V, 65]</ref> With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.<ref name = V65/> Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.97 V, 96]</ref> In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.<ref name = h131>Holland, pp. 131\u201332</ref> Cleisthenes, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by Isagoras and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the ''demos'' (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena. This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, Cleomenes I, returned at the request of Isagoras and so Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonids and other prominent Athenian families were exiled from Athens. When Isagoras attempted to create a narrow oligarchic government, the Athenian people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled Cleomenes and Isagoras.<ref name = \"h133\">Holland, pp. 133\u201336</ref> Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position.

Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.<ref name = L59/> There are two main theories to explain this.<ref name = L59/>\n\nThe first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the ''[[Suda]]'' dictionary.<ref name = L59/> The entry ''\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd'' (\"without cavalry\") is explained thus: <blockquote>The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle.<ref>[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''</ref></blockquote> There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.<ref name = h187/> This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.115.1 VI, 115]</ref> Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.<ref name = L59/> Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.<ref name = L59/> Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.<ref name = L59/> It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.\n\n=== Date of the battle ===\nHerodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August B\u00f6ckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.<ref name = date/>  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens. In that case the battle took place on August 12, 490 BC.<ref name = date>D.W.

In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available [[hoplite]]s;<ref name = h187/> and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.<ref name = L56/> Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.<ref name = h191/> Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.<ref name = h187/> However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.<ref name = h187/><ref name = L59/> Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.<ref name = L59/> Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name = L256>Lazenby, p. 256</ref>) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.<ref name = h191/> The camp of the Athenians was located on a spur of mount Agrieliki next to the plain of Marathon; remains of its fortifications are still visible.<ref>Lagos&Karyanos, pp. 109-124</ref>\n\nWhatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.<ref name = h191/> Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.<ref name = L59/> Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;<ref>Lazenby, p. 67</ref> the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.<ref name = L256/> If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.<ref name = L59/> Alternatively, they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory\u2014they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.<ref name = L59/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Les H\u00e9ros de Marathon Georges Rochegrosse 1859.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Greek troops rushing forward at the Battle of Marathon, [[Georges Rochegrosse]], 1859.]]\n[[File:They crashed into Persian army with tremendous force.jpg|thumb|\"They crashed into the Persian army with tremendous force\", [https://archive.org/stream/storyofgreecetol00macg#page/136/mode/2up illustration] by Walter Crane in Mary Macgregor, ''The Story of Greece Told to Boys and Girls'', London: T.C. & E.C.

Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen. The [[phalanx]] formation proved successful, because the hoplites had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the Persian soldiers were accustomed to a very different kind of conflict. At Marathon, the Athenians thinned their centre in order to make their army equal in length to the Persian army,<ref>Herod. Histories 6.111,3</ref> not as a result of a tactical planning.<ref>Lazenby 258</ref> It seems that the Persian centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious Greek wings. Lazenby (1993)  believes that the ultimate reason for the Greek success was the courage the Greeks displayed:\n<blockquote> Marathon was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a trot when the arrows began to fall, instead of grinding to a halt, and when surprisingly the enemy wings fled, not to take the easy way out and follow them, but to stop and somehow come to the aid of the hard pressured centre.<ref>Lazenby p. 258</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vic Hurley]], the Persian defeat is explained by the \"complete failure ... to field a representative army\", calling the battle the \"most convincing\" example of the fact that infantry-bowmen cannot defend any position while stationed in close-quarters and unsupported<ref>[[Vic Hurley]], ''Arrows Against Steel: The History of the Bow and how it Forever Changed Warfare'', Cerberus Books, 2011, {{ISBN|9780983475613}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j64zo7pzt3sC&lpg=PA66&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> (i.e. by fortifications, or failing to support them by [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|cavalry and chariots]], as was the common Persian tactic).\n\n[[File:Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile (reconstitution).jpg|thumb|center|upright=4|Contemporary depiction of the Battle of Marathon in the [[Stoa Poikile]] (reconstitution)]]\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115/> As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.

Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History\",<ref>Cicero, On the Laws I, 5</ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his ''Enquiries'' (Greek \u2013 ''Historiai''; English \u2013 ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440\u2013430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented \"history\" as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"<ref name = hxvi>Holland, pp. xvi\u2013xvii.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battlefield of Marathon.jpg|thumb|The battlefield of Marathon]]\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g., [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=1.22 I, 22]</ref><ref name = Fin15>Finley, p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.<ref name = Fin15/> [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay ''[[On the malice of Herodotus]]'', describing Herodotus as \"''Philobarbaros''\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref>Holland, p. xxiv.</ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm#1|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377>Holland, p. 377.</ref> The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historiai'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.<ref>Fehling, pp. 1\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]</ref> The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]].

Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).<ref name = \"h187\"/> Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: \"[[panic]]\". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105]</ref>\n\n[[File:Nike Callimachus.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstitution of the ''[[Nike of Callimachus]]'', erected in honor of the Battle of Marathon.

This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled.

Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor [[Echetlaeus]] (\"he of the Plough-tail\") as a hero.<ref name=\"Pausanias I, 32\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnother tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.<ref>Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38</ref>\n\n=== Marathon run ===\n{{Main|Marathon}}\n[[File:Phidippides.jpg|thumb|[[Luc-Olivier Merson]]'s painting depicting the runner announcing the victory at the Battle of Marathon to the people of [[Athens]].]]\nAccording to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta the day after he left.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105\u201306]</ref> Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.<ref name = \"h198\">Holland, p. 198</ref>\n\n[[File:1896 Olympic marathon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Burton Holmes]]' photograph entitled ''\"1896: Three athletes in training for the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens\"''.]]\nLater, in popular imagination, these two events were conflated, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word \"nenik\u0113kamen!\" ([[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd}}; we've won!), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to Herodotus;{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} actually, the story first appears in [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Glory of Athens'' in the 1st century AD, who quotes from [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heracleides of Pontus]]'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.<ref>Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 347C</ref> [[Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).<ref>Lucian, III</ref> In some medieval codices of Herodotus, the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides, and this name is also preferred in a few modern editions.<ref>Lazenby, p. 52</ref>\n\nWhen the idea of a modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.<ref name = AIMS/> The idea of organizing a \"marathon race\" came from [[Michel Br\u00e9al]], who wanted the event to feature in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896 in Athens.

It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. According to [[Herodotus]], Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow \"upwards towards heaven\", saying as he did so: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say \"Master, remember the Athenians\" three times before dinner each day.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh5100.htm Herodotus Book 5: Terpsichore, 105] \"...he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when he had been informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it and placed an arrow upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards heaven, and as he shot into the air he said: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Having so said he charged one of his attendants, that when dinner was set before the king he should say always three times: \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"</ref>\n\nAt the time of the battle, [[Sparta]] and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for [[Attica]], landing in the bay near the town of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message to the Spartans asking for support. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.\n\nThe Athenians and their allies chose a location for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|Persian cavalry]] from joining the Persian infantry. [[Miltiades]], the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian forces, composed primarily of missile troops. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his centre. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] restarted the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.\n\nThe Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to have begun at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks that they were able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This victory was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. The following two hundred years saw the rise of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society and so the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Ionian Revolt|First Persian invasion of Greece}}\n[[File:Plain of Marathon with Pine Forest and Wetlands, May 2015 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The plain of Marathon today, with pine forest and wetlands.]]\n[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.<ref name = h47>Holland, pp. 47\u201355</ref><ref name = h58>Holland, pp. 58\u201362</ref><ref name=\"h203\"/> Moreover, the Persian King Darius was a [[usurper]], and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.<ref name = h47/> Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] to become [[Achaemenid Macedonia|a vassal]] of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}}  Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of ancient Greece may have been inevitable.<ref name = h58/> However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.<ref name = h171>Holland, 171\u201378</ref> Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.<ref name = h171/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref>\n\nThe Ionian Revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].<ref name = h154>Holland, pp. 154\u201357</ref> In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.<ref name = h154/> The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.<ref name = h154/><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.98 V, 97]</ref> Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.<ref name = h157>Holland, pp. 157\u201361</ref>\n\nThe involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.<ref name = h157/>\n\nIn 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.<ref name = V65>Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.65 V, 65]</ref> With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.<ref name = V65/> Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.97 V, 96]</ref> In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.<ref name = h131>Holland, pp. 131\u201332</ref> Cleisthenes, however, found himself being politically defeated by a coalition led by Isagoras and decided to change the rules of the game by appealing to the ''demos'' (the people), in effect making them a new faction in the political arena. This tactic succeeded, but the Spartan King, Cleomenes I, returned at the request of Isagoras and so Cleisthenes, the Alcmaeonids and other prominent Athenian families were exiled from Athens. When Isagoras attempted to create a narrow oligarchic government, the Athenian people, in a spontaneous and unprecedented move, expelled Cleomenes and Isagoras.<ref name = \"h133\">Holland, pp. 133\u201336</ref> Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to reform the state with the aim of securing his position.  The result was not actually a democracy or a real civic state, but he enabled the development of a fully democratic government, which would emerge in the next generation as the demos realized its power.<ref>For a full account and analysis see R.M.

Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.<ref name = L59/> There are two main theories to explain this.<ref name = L59/>\n\nThe first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the ''[[Suda]]'' dictionary.<ref name = L59/> The entry ''\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd'' (\"without cavalry\") is explained thus: <blockquote>The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle.<ref>[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''</ref></blockquote> There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.<ref name = h187/> This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115>Herodotus [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.115.1 VI, 115]</ref> Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.<ref name = L59/> Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.<ref name = L59/> Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.<ref name = L59/> It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.\n\n=== Date of the battle ===\nHerodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August B\u00f6ckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.<ref name = date/>  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens. In that case the battle took place on August 12, 490 BC.<ref name = date>D.W.

In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available [[hoplite]]s;<ref name = h187/> and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.<ref name = L56/> Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.<ref name = h191/> Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered.<ref name = h187/> However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.<ref name = h187/><ref name = L59/> Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.<ref name = L59/> Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.<ref name = h191/>\n\nThe Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name = L256>Lazenby, p. 256</ref>) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.<ref name = h191/> The camp of the Athenians was located on a spur of mount Agrieliki next to the plain of Marathon; remains of its fortifications are still visible.<ref>Lagos&Karyanos, pp. 109-124</ref>\n\nWhatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.<ref name = h191/> Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.<ref name = L59/> Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;<ref>Lazenby, p. 67</ref> the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.<ref name = L256/> If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.<ref name = L59/> Alternatively, they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory\u2014they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.<ref name = L59/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Les H\u00e9ros de Marathon Georges Rochegrosse 1859.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Greek troops rushing forward at the Battle of Marathon, [[Georges Rochegrosse]], 1859.]]\n[[File:They crashed into Persian army with tremendous force.jpg|thumb|\"They crashed into the Persian army with tremendous force\", [https://archive.org/stream/storyofgreecetol00macg#page/136/mode/2up illustration] by Walter Crane in Mary Macgregor, ''The Story of Greece Told to Boys and Girls'', London: T.C. & E.C.

Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen. The [[phalanx]] formation proved successful, because the hoplites had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the Persian soldiers were accustomed to a very different kind of conflict. At Marathon, the Athenians thinned their centre in order to make their army equal in length to the Persian army,<ref>Herod. Histories 6.111,3</ref> not as a result of a tactical planning.<ref>Lazenby 258</ref> It seems that the Persian centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious Greek wings. Lazenby (1993)  believes that the ultimate reason for the Greek success was the courage the Greeks displayed:\n<blockquote> Marathon was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a trot when the arrows began to fall, instead of grinding to a halt, and when surprisingly the enemy wings fled, not to take the easy way out and follow them, but to stop and somehow come to the aid of the hard pressured centre.<ref>Lazenby p. 258</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vic Hurley]], the Persian defeat is explained by the \"complete failure ... to field a representative army\", calling the battle the \"most convincing\" example of the fact that infantry-bowmen cannot defend any position while stationed in close-quarters and unsupported<ref>[[Vic Hurley]], ''Arrows Against Steel: The History of the Bow and how it Forever Changed Warfare'', Cerberus Books, 2011, {{ISBN|9780983475613}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j64zo7pzt3sC&lpg=PA66&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> (i.e. by fortifications, or failing to support them by [[Achaemenid Empire#Cavalry|cavalry and chariots]], as was the common Persian tactic).\n\n[[File:Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile (reconstitution).jpg|thumb|center|upright=4|Contemporary depiction of the Battle of Marathon in the [[Stoa Poikile]] (reconstitution)]]\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.<ref name = VI115/> As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.

Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History\",<ref>Cicero, On the Laws I, 5</ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his ''Enquiries'' (Greek \u2013 ''Historiai''; English \u2013 ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440\u2013430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ended in 450 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented \"history\" as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"<ref name = hxvi>Holland, pp. xvi\u2013xvii.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battlefield of Marathon.jpg|thumb|The battlefield of Marathon]]\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g., [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=1.22 I, 22]</ref><ref name = Fin15>Finley, p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.<ref name = Fin15/> [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay ''[[On the malice of Herodotus]]'', describing Herodotus as \"''Philobarbaros''\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref>Holland, p. xxiv.</ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm#1|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377>Holland, p. 377.</ref> The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historiai'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.<ref>Fehling, pp. 1\u2013277.</ref>\n\nThe Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]</ref> The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Legends associated with the battle ===\n[[File:Pan satyre della Valle.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Statue of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Capitoline Museum]], Rome]]\n\nThe most famous legend associated with Marathon is that of the runner [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides) bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described [[#Marathon run|below]].\n\nPheidippides' run to Sparta to bring aid has other legends associated with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).<ref name = \"h187\"/> Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: \"[[panic]]\". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.105 VI, 105]</ref>\n\n[[File:Nike Callimachus.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstitution of the ''[[Nike of Callimachus]]'', erected in honor of the Battle of Marathon.

This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. [[Xenophon]] notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.<ref>Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'', 26</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' III, 2</ref><ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' II, 25</ref><ref>Aristophanes, ''The Knights'', 660</ref>\n\nPlutarch mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King [[Theseus]], the mythical hero of Athens, leading the army in full battle gear in the charge against the Persians,<ref>Plutarch, ''Theseus'', 35</ref> and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the [[Stoa Poikile]] fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes.<ref>Pausanias I, 15</ref> Pausanias also tells us that: <blockquote>They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor [[Echetlaeus]] (\"he of the Plough-tail\") as a hero.<ref name=\"Pausanias I, 32\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnother tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.<ref>Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38</ref>\n\n=== Marathon run ===\n{{Main|Marathon}}\n[[File:Phidippides.jpg|thumb|[[Luc-Olivier Merson]]'s painting depicting the runner announcing the victory at the Battle of Marathon to the people of [[Athens]].]]\nAccording to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance before the battle.

Politically, the term refers to three [[provinces and territories of Canada|territories of Canada]]: [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]. Similarly, ''the Far North'' (when contrasted to ''the North'') may refer to the Canadian [[Arctic]]: the portion of Canada that lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]], east of [[Alaska]] and west of [[Greenland]]. This area covers about 39% of Canada's total land area, but has less than 1% of [[demographics of Canada|Canada's population]].\n\nThese reckonings somewhat depend on the arbitrary concept of [[nordicity]], a measure of so-called \"northernness\" that other Arctic territories share. Canada is the northernmost country in the Americas (excluding the neighbouring [[Denmark|Danish]] Arctic territory of [[Greenland]] which extends slightly further north) and roughly 80% of its 38 million residents are concentrated along [[Canada\u2013United States border|its southern border]] with the United States.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The different climates of these two regions result in vastly different vegetation, and therefore very different economies, settlement patterns, and histories.\n\n[[File:Taiga Landscape in Canada.jpg|thumb|left|A [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] landscape in [[Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec|Northern Quebec]].]]\nThe \"near north\" or [[subarctic]] is mostly synonymous with the [[boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], a large area of [[evergreen]]-dominated forests with a [[subarctic climate]]. This area has traditionally been home to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], that is the [[First Nations]], who were [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of [[moose]], freshwater [[fisherman|fishers]] and [[Animal trapping|trappers]]. This region was heavily involved in the [[North American fur trade]] during its peak importance, and is home to many [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] who originated in that trade. The area was mostly part of [[Rupert's Land]] or the [[North-Western Territory]] under the nominal control of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) from 1670\u20131869. The HBC's claim was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869, and shortly thereafter the government made a [[Numbered Treaties|series of treaties with the local First Nations]] regarding land title. This opened the region to non-Native settlement, as well as to forestry, mining, and oil and gas drilling. Today several million people live in the near north, around 15% of the Canadian total. Large parts of the near north are not part of Canada's territories, but rather are the northern parts of the provinces, meaning they have very different political histories as minority regions within larger units.\n\n[[File:Nunavut tundra -c.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[tundra]] landscape in [[Nunavut]].]]\nThe \"far north\" is synonymous with the areas north of the [[tree line]]: the [[Barren Grounds]] and [[tundra]]. This area is home to the various sub-groups of the [[Inuit]], a people unrelated to other [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]]. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting [[marine mammal]]s and [[Reindeer|caribou]], mainly [[barren-ground caribou]], as well as fish and migratory birds. This area was somewhat involved in the [[fur trade]], but was more influenced by the [[history of whaling|whaling industry]]. This area was not part of the early 20th century treaty process and [[aboriginal title]] to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous territories]] instead of the [[Indian reserve]]s of further south. Very few non-Aboriginal people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada's total population. The far north is also often broken into west and eastern halves. The '''eastern Arctic''' which means the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle); [[Nunavik]], an autonomous part of the province of Quebec; [[Nunatsiavut]], an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and perhaps a few parts of the [[Hudson Bay]] coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The '''western Arctic''' is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly [[Inuvik Region]]) and a small part of Yukon, together called the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]].\n\n==Territoriality==\nSince 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between [[60th meridian west|60\u00b0W]] and [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0W]] longitude, extending all the way north to the [[North Pole]]: all islands in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and [[Herschel Island|Herschel]], off the Yukon coast, form part of the region, are Canadian territory and the [[territorial waters]] claimed by Canada surround these islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509193315/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |title=Territorial Evolution, 1927 |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> Views of territorial claims in this region are complicated by disagreements on legal principles. Canada and the [[Soviet Union]]/Russia have long claimed that their territory extends according to the sector principle to the North Pole. The United States does not accept the sector principle and does not make a sector claim based on its [[Alaska]]n Arctic coast. Claims that undersea geographic features are extensions of a country's [[continental shelf]] are also used to support claims; for example the Denmark/[[Greenland]] claim on territory to the North Pole, some of which is disputed by Canada. Foreign ships, both civilian and military, are allowed the right of [[innocent passage]] through the territorial waters of a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] state subject to conditions in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelaw.com/LawSea/ls82_1.htm|title=GlobeLaw.com|website=www.globelaw.com}}</ref> The right of innocent passage is not allowed, however, in [[internal waters]], which are enclosed bodies of water or waters landward of a chain of islands. Disagreements about the sector principle or extension of territory to the North Pole and about the definition of internal waters in the Arctic lie behind differences in [[territorial claims in the Arctic]]. This claim is recognized by most countries with some exceptions, including the United States; Denmark, Russia, and Norway have made claims similar to those of Canada in the Arctic and are opposed by the European Union and the U.S. This is especially important with the [[Northwest Passage]]. Canada asserts control of this passage as part of the [[Canadian Internal Waters]] because it is within {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} of Canadian islands; the U.S. claims that it is in [[international waters]]. Today ice and freezing temperatures make this a minor issue, but [[climate change]] may make the passage more accessible to shipping, something that concerns the Canadian government and inhabitants of the environmentally sensitive region.<ref>Paikin, Zach. \"[http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/Canada-The-Arctic-Middle-Man-2014-08-21 Canada: The Arctic Middle Man]\" ''Maritime Executive'', 21 August 2014. Accessed: 11 September 2014.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the disputed [[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]], which is west of Greenland, may be an indication of challenges to overall Canadian sovereignty in the North.\n\n==Topography (geography)==\n[[File:Spring in the Canadian Arctic.jpg|thumb|The western Canadian Arctic early June 2010.]]\n\nWhile the largest part of the Arctic is composed of [[sea ice|permanent ice]] and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Innuitian Mountains]], associated with the [[Arctic Cordillera]] mountain system, are geologically distinct from the Arctic Region (which consists largely of [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|lowlands]]). The [[Arctic Lowlands|Arctic]] and [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often considered part of the [[Canadian Shield]] (in contrast to the sole geological area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.\n\nThe Arctic [[drainage basin|watershed (or drainage basin)]] drains northern parts of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut as well as parts of Yukon into the [[Arctic Ocean]], including the [[Beaufort Sea]] and [[Baffin Bay]]. With the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], Canada's longest river, this watershed has been little used for [[hydroelectricity]]. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] rivers along with [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] and [[Great Slave Lake]] (respectively the largest and second [[List of lakes by area|largest lakes]] wholly enclosed within Canada), are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie so that it thereby drains the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.\n\n==Climate==\n\n===Overview===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of Northern Canada has a [[subarctic climate]], with a [[tundra climate]] in most of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and an [[Ice cap climate]] in [[Arctic Cordillera]].<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

Politically, the term refers to three [[provinces and territories of Canada|territories of Canada]]: [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]. Similarly, ''the Far North'' (when contrasted to ''the North'') may refer to the Canadian [[Arctic]]: the portion of Canada that lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]], east of [[Alaska]] and west of [[Greenland]]. This area covers about 39% of Canada's total land area, but has less than 1% of [[demographics of Canada|Canada's population]].\n\nThese reckonings somewhat depend on the arbitrary concept of [[nordicity]], a measure of so-called \"northernness\" that other Arctic territories share. Canada is the northernmost country in the Americas (excluding the neighbouring [[Denmark|Danish]] Arctic territory of [[Greenland]] which extends slightly further north) and roughly 80% of its 35 million residents are concentrated along [[Canada\u2013United States border|its southern border]] with the United States.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The different climates of these two regions result in vastly different vegetation, and therefore very different economies, settlement patterns, and histories.\n\n[[File:Taiga Landscape in Canada.jpg|thumb|left|A [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] landscape in [[Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec|Northern Quebec]].]]\nThe \"near north\" or [[subarctic]] is mostly synonymous with the [[boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], a large area of [[evergreen]]-dominated forests with a [[subarctic climate]]. This area has traditionally been home to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], that is the [[First Nations]], who were [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of [[moose]], freshwater [[fisherman|fishers]] and [[Animal trapping|trappers]]. This region was heavily involved in the [[North American fur trade]] during its peak importance, and is home to many [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] who originated in that trade. The area was mostly part of [[Rupert's Land]] or the [[North-Western Territory]] under the nominal control of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) from 1670\u20131869. The HBC's claim was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869, and shortly thereafter the government made a [[Numbered Treaties|series of treaties with the local First Nations]] regarding land title. This opened the region to non-Native settlement, as well as to forestry, mining, and oil and gas drilling. Today several million people live in the near north, around 15% of the Canadian total. Large parts of the near north are not part of Canada's territories, but rather are the northern parts of the provinces, meaning they have very different political histories as minority regions within larger units.\n\n[[File:Nunavut tundra -c.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[tundra]] landscape in [[Nunavut]].]]\nThe \"far north\" is synonymous with the areas north of the [[tree line]]: the [[Barren Grounds]] and [[tundra]]. This area is home to the various sub-groups of the [[Inuit]], a people unrelated to other [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]]. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting [[marine mammal]]s and [[Reindeer|caribou]], mainly [[barren-ground caribou]], as well as fish and migratory birds. This area was somewhat involved in the [[fur trade]], but was more influenced by the [[history of whaling|whaling industry]]. This area was not part of the early 20th century treaty process and [[aboriginal title]] to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous territories]] instead of the [[Indian reserve]]s of further south. Very few non-Aboriginal people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada's total population. The far north is also often broken into west and eastern halves. The '''eastern Arctic''' which means the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle); [[Nunavik]], an autonomous part of the province of Quebec; [[Nunatsiavut]], an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and perhaps a few parts of the [[Hudson Bay]] coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The '''western Arctic''' is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly [[Inuvik Region]]) and a small part of Yukon, together called the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]].\n\n==Territoriality==\nSince 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between [[60th meridian west|60\u00b0W]] and [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0W]] longitude, extending all the way north to the [[North Pole]]: all islands in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and [[Herschel Island|Herschel]], off the Yukon coast, form part of the region, are Canadian territory and the [[territorial waters]] claimed by Canada surround these islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509193315/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |title=Territorial Evolution, 1927 |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> Views of territorial claims in this region are complicated by disagreements on legal principles. Canada and the [[Soviet Union]]/Russia have long claimed that their territory extends according to the sector principle to the North Pole. The United States does not accept the sector principle and does not make a sector claim based on its [[Alaska]]n Arctic coast. Claims that undersea geographic features are extensions of a country's [[continental shelf]] are also used to support claims; for example the Denmark/[[Greenland]] claim on territory to the North Pole, some of which is disputed by Canada. Foreign ships, both civilian and military, are allowed the right of [[innocent passage]] through the territorial waters of a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] state subject to conditions in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelaw.com/LawSea/ls82_1.htm|title=GlobeLaw.com|website=www.globelaw.com}}</ref> The right of innocent passage is not allowed, however, in [[internal waters]], which are enclosed bodies of water or waters landward of a chain of islands. Disagreements about the sector principle or extension of territory to the North Pole and about the definition of internal waters in the Arctic lie behind differences in [[territorial claims in the Arctic]]. This claim is recognized by most countries with some exceptions, including the United States; Denmark, Russia, and Norway have made claims similar to those of Canada in the Arctic and are opposed by the European Union and the U.S. This is especially important with the [[Northwest Passage]]. Canada asserts control of this passage as part of the [[Canadian Internal Waters]] because it is within {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} of Canadian islands; the U.S. claims that it is in [[international waters]]. Today ice and freezing temperatures make this a minor issue, but [[climate change]] may make the passage more accessible to shipping, something that concerns the Canadian government and inhabitants of the environmentally sensitive region.<ref>Paikin, Zach. \"[http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/Canada-The-Arctic-Middle-Man-2014-08-21 Canada: The Arctic Middle Man]\" ''Maritime Executive'', 21 August 2014. Accessed: 11 September 2014.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the disputed [[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]], which is west of Greenland, may be an indication of challenges to overall Canadian sovereignty in the North.\n\n==Topography (geography)==\n[[File:Spring in the Canadian Arctic.jpg|thumb|The western Canadian Arctic early June 2010.]]\n\nWhile the largest part of the Arctic is composed of [[sea ice|permanent ice]] and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Innuitian Mountains]], associated with the [[Arctic Cordillera]] mountain system, are geologically distinct from the Arctic Region (which consists largely of [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|lowlands]]). The [[Arctic Lowlands|Arctic]] and [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often considered part of the [[Canadian Shield]] (in contrast to the sole geological area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.\n\nThe Arctic [[drainage basin|watershed (or drainage basin)]] drains northern parts of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut as well as parts of Yukon into the [[Arctic Ocean]], including the [[Beaufort Sea]] and [[Baffin Bay]]. With the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], Canada's longest river, this watershed has been little used for [[hydroelectricity]]. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] and [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] rivers along with [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] and [[Great Slave Lake]] (respectively the largest and second [[List of lakes by area|largest lakes]] wholly enclosed within Canada), are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie so that it thereby drains the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.\n\n==Climate==\n\n===Overview===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of Northern Canada has a [[subarctic climate]], with a [[tundra climate]] in most of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and an [[Ice cap climate]] in [[Arctic Cordillera]].<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

He was the first ruler of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the last male monarch from the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]].\n\nSigismund was the only legitimate son of Italian-born [[Bona Sforza]] and Sigismund the Old. From the beginning he was groomed and extensively educated as a successor. In 1529 he was crowned ''[[vivente rege]]'' while his father was still alive. Sigismund Augustus continued a tolerance policy towards minorities and maintained peaceful relations with neighbouring countries, with the exception of the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] which aimed to secure [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] trade. Under his patronage the culture flourished in Poland; he was a collector of tapestries from the [[Low Countries]] and collected military memorabilia as well as swords, armours and jewellery. Sigismund Augustus' rule is widely considered as the apex of the [[Polish Golden Age]]; he established the first regular Polish navy and the first regular [[Mail|postal service]] in Poland, known today as [[Poczta Polska]]. In 1569 he oversaw the signing of the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which formed the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and introduced an [[elective monarchy]].  \n\nSigismund Augustus married three times; his first wife, [[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth of Austria]], died in 1545 at just eighteen. He was then involved in several relationships with mistresses, the most famous being [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], who became Sigismund's second wife and Queen of Poland in spite of his mother's disapproval. The marriage was deemed scandalous and was fiercely opposed by the royal court and the [[Szlachta|nobility]]. Barbara died five months after her coronation, presumably due to ill health, however, rumours circulated that she was poisoned. Sigismund finally wedded [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Poland|Catherine of Austria]], but remained childless throughout his life. \n\nSigismund Augustus was last male member of the [[Jagiellons]]. Following the death of his sister [[Anna Jagiellon|Anna]] in 1596 the Jagiellonian dynasty came to an end.\n\n==Royal titles==\n* Royal titles, in [[Latin]]: \"''Sigismundus Augustus, Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, nec non terrarum Cracoviae, Sandomiriae, Siradiae, Lanciciae, Cuiaviae, Kiioviae, dominus hereditarius Russiae, Woliniae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Podlachiae, Culmensis, Elbingensis, Pomeraniae, Samogitiae, Livoniae etc. dominus et heres''.\"\n* English translation: \"Sigismund Augustus, by the Grace of God, King of [[Poland]], Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], Lord and heir of the Lands of [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Sieradz]], [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Kiev]], Hereditary Lord of [[Ruthenia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Podlaskie]], [[Culmer Land]], [[Elbing]], [[Pomerania]], [[Samogitia]], [[Duchy of Livonia|Livonia]] etc. Lord and heir\"\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Royal armoury Stockholm 1.jpg|thumb|left|Parade [[armour]] of King Sigismund Augustus, made in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Kunz Lochner]], 1550s. [[Livrustkammaren]] in [[Stockholm]].]]\nSigismund Augustus was born in Krak\u00f3w on 1 August 1520 to Sigismund I the Old and his wife, [[Bona Sforza]] of [[Milan]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], King of Poland, and [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436\u20131505)|Elizabeth of Austria]]. Sigismund's maternal grandparents, [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]] and [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], daughter of King [[Alfonso II of Naples]], both [[List of rulers of Milan|ruled]] the [[Duchy of Milan]] until Sforza's suspicious death in 1494. \n\nThroughout his youth, Sigismund Augustus was under the careful watch of his mother, Bona. Being the only legitimate male heir to the Polish throne throughout his father's reign, he was well educated and taught by the most renowned scholars in the country. It was also his mother's wish to name her only son Augustus, after the first [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Gaius Octavius Augustus]]. However, this decision was met with Sigismund the Old's strong disapproval, who hoped for a lineage of Sigismunds on the Polish throne. Consequently, it was established that the child will bear two names to settle the conflict. The tradition of adopting Augustus as a second or middle name was also observed during the [[coronation]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw Antoni Poniatowski]] who became King Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus in 1764.\n\nIn 1530, the ten-year-old Sigismund Augustus was crowned by [[Primate of Poland|Primate]] [[Jan \u0141aski (1456\u20131531)|Jan \u0141aski]] as co-ruler alongside his father, in accordance with the ''[[vivente rege]]'' law. Sigismund the Old hoped to secure his son's succession to the throne and maintain the Jagiellonian dynasty's position in Poland. The move was crucial to silence the members of nobility who were against the Jagiellons and viewed the action as a step towards [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. The law was officially abolished by the [[Henrician Articles]], or the new constitution adopted between nobles and the newly elected king [[Henry III of France|Henry de Valois]] in 1573.\n\n===First marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger Elizabeth of Austria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth Habsburg]], Queen of Poland, by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]]]]\nWhen Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned, Chancellor [[Krzysztof Szyd\u0142owiecki]] organized a preliminary marriage treaty between the young king and [[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth Habsburg]], daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]]. The marriage was signed on 10\u201311 November 1530 in [[Pozna\u0144]], however, the arrangement was delayed by Queen Bona Sforza, who detested the new bride. The treaty was renewed on 16 June 1538 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] by [[Johannes Dantiscus]] and the betrothal ceremony took place on 17 July 1538 in [[Innsbruck]]. Bona continued to lobby against the marriage and instead proposed Princess [[Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry|Margaret of France]] to potentially form an alliance with the French against the [[Habsburgs]]. \n\nOn 5 May 1543, Elizabeth's escorted convoy entered Krak\u00f3w and was greeted with enthusiasm by both the nobles and the townsfolk. The same day 16-year-old Elizabeth married 22-year-old Sigismund Augustus, whom she met for the first time shortly before marriage vows. The ceremony was performed at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] and the wedding continued for two weeks. As Elizabeth was granted the title of Queen, her mother-in-law Bona began to plot against the new monarchess. As a result, the newly wedded couple decided to reside in [[Vilnius]], far from the royal court.\n\nDespite the initial euphoria demonstrated by royal subjects, the marriage was unsuccessful from the very beginning. Sigismund Augustus did not find Elizabeth attractive and continued to have extramarital affairs with several mistresses, the most famous being [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. Elizabeth was also known to be timid, meek and apprehensive due to strict upbringing. The young and garrulous king was also repulsed by Elizabeth's newly diagnosed [[epilepsy]] and subsequent seizures. Only Sigismund the Old and some nobles showed compassion towards the new Queen, who was disregarded by her husband and scorned by Bona. Sigismund Augustus was indifferent to her health condition; when the seizures continued to intensify he abandoned Elizabeth and returned to Krak\u00f3w to collect her [[dowry]]. He also sent for Ferdinand's doctors to travel the long distance from [[Vienna]] knowing that Elizabeth was ailing and deteriorating fast. She eventually died unattended and exhausted from the epileptic attacks on 15 June 1545 at the age of 18.\n\n===Second marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142 by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (ca. 1553]]\nFrom the outset of his reign, Sigismund Augustus came into collision with the country's privileged [[Szlachta|nobility]], who had already begun curtailing the power of the great families. The ostensible cause of the nobility's animosity to the King was his second marriage, secretly contracted before his accession to the throne, with the [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Calvinist]] and former mistress, [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], the daughter of [[Hetman]] [[Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. The marriage was announced by the king himself on 2 February 1548 in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski]]. \n\nThe young and beautiful Barbara was despised by dowager Queen Bona, who attempted to annul the marriage at any cost. The agitation was also abundant at Sigismund's first [[Sejm]] (parliament) sitting on 31 October 1548 where the deputies threatened to renounce their allegiance unless the new king repudiated Barbara. The nobles portrayed Barbara as an opportunistic prostitute that charmed the king for her own benefit. That perception was shared with Bona Sforza, who decisively eliminated all her rivals by any means to stay in power. The young monarch even considered [[abdication|abdicating]]. By 1550, when Sigismund summoned his second Sejm, the nobles had begun to be in his favor; the nobility was rebuked by Marshal [[Piotr Kmita Sobie\u0144ski]], who accused them of attempting to unduly diminish the legislative prerogatives of the Polish Crown. Furthermore, Bona was removed from [[Wawel Castle|Wawel]] and sent to [[Mazovia]] where she established her own small courtly entourage.<ref>Duczmal (2012), p. 119</ref> \n\n[[File:Zygmunt August i Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna.jpg|thumb|left|Sigismund and Barbara attended by courtiers. Sketch by [[Jan Matejko|Matejko]].]]\n\nUnlike her predecessor, Barbara was disliked by the royal court and led a more secluded life with Sigismund Augustus, who was deeply in love with her. On the other hand, she was ambitious, intelligent, perceptive and had an exemplar taste in fashion. She always wore precious pearl necklaces when sitting for portraits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historia.org.pl/2016/05/30/barbara-radziwillowna-wielka-milosc-zygmunta-augusta/|title=Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna - wielka mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 Zygmunta Augusta &#124; HISTORIA.org.pl - historia, kultura, muzea, matura, rekonstrukcje i recenzje historyczne|first=Milena|last=pisze|date=30 May 2016}}</ref> The mutual admiration between Sigismund and Barbara made the relationship \"one of the greatest love affairs in Polish history\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,17158033,Barbara_Radziwillowna_i_Zygmunt_August__Najwiekszy.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Wyborcza.pl|website=wyborcza.pl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2019/03/03/zygmunt-august-i-barbara-radziwillowna-jak-naprawde-krol-traktowal-swoja-ukochana/|title=By\u0142 dla niej najgorszym \u0142ajdakiem i \u015bwini\u0105.

To ease the situation, Sigismund Augustus provided a luxurious lifestyle and expensive gifts for his wife at [[Wawel Castle]] since her arrival in Krak\u00f3w on 13 February 1549. The monarch also granted Barbara several provinces to administer and provide income. Although ambitious and bright, she showed lack of interest in political life, but had some influence over decisions made by Sigismund. This also caused an uproar among the nobility. To avoid an armed rebellion, Sigismund was forced to form an alliance with his former father-in-law, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of the Holy Roman Empire]]. This allowed for Barbara's coronation as Queen of Poland on 7 December 1550 by Primate [[Miko\u0142aj Dzierzgowski]]. Queen dowager Bona eventually succumbed to her son's demand and accepted the marriage.\n\n[[File:Simmler Death of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142.jpg|thumb|225px|''Death of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142'', painting by [[J\u00f3zef Simmler]].]]\n\nSince the day Sigismund and Barbara met, she complained of poor health, particularly stomach and abdominal pain. After the coronation her condition deteriorated rapidly. She was tormented by strong fever, diarrhea, [[nausea]] and lack of appetite. After careful observation by hired medics, a lump was discovered on her stomach filled with pus. Sigismund Augustus gravely despaired and sent for doctors and even folk healers from the entire country. He personally tended to his sick wife despite her foul smell and dedicated himself when necessary; the king hoped to take Barbara to the hunting castle at [[Niepo\u0142omice]] and ordered to demolish the small city gate so her carriage could pass freely. However, Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in [[Krak\u00f3w]] after continuous pain and agony. It was her dying wish that she'd be buried in Lithuania, her homeland. The body was transported to [[Vilnius Cathedral]], where she was finally buried on 23 June next to Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a major blow to Sigismund; he often attended her coffin on foot while being transported to Vilnius in hot weather. Sigismund also became more serious and reserved; he avoided balls, temporarily renounced his mistresses and dressed black until death.\n\nThe cause of Barbara's death is debatable. Her opponents and family members suggested [[sexually transmitted disease]]s due to a number of affairs she had before marrying Sigismund. There were also persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Queen Bona Sforza, who had a long history of eliminating her rivals or enemies quickly and efficiently. However, contemporary historians and experts agree on [[Cervical cancer|cervical]] or [[ovarian cancer]].\n\n===Third marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger  Catherine of Austria.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Catherine of Austria by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]].]]\n\nThe death of Queen Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, five months after her coronation and under distressing circumstances, compelled Sigismund to contract a third, purely political union with his first cousin, the Austrian archduchess [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Poland|Catherine]], to avoid an Austro-Russian alliance. She was also the sister of his first wife, Elizabeth, who had died within a year of her marriage to him, before his accession. Catherine, unlike previous queens, was considered dull and obese. Sigismund Augustus found her immensely unattractive despite accepting the marriage and organizing a pompous wedding ceremony on 30 July 1553. On the other hand, Catherine showed resentment towards Sigismund because of how he treated her sister and first wife, Queen Elizabeth. She accused him of negligence and indifference during her sudden illness, which caused premature death. The correspondence between the two remained purely formal and political for the remainder of their lives. \n\nSince her coronation, Catherine acted as Austria's puppet at the Polish court; she was tasked with [[espionage]] and obtaining important information for the benefit of the Habsburgs. Sigismund Augustus was aware of the scheme, but, by marrying Catherine, Austria promised to stay neutral and abandon plans with Russia. This neutrality was undermined by Catherine's actions, who followed her father's policy and objected the return of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]] and [[Isabella Jagiellon]] (Sigismund's sister) to Hungary. She would conspire with the Habsburg envoys prior to an audience with the king. She would also dictate what and how the envoys should express their views. When Sigismund Augustus found out of Catherine's intrigues, he sent her to [[Radom]] and excluded from political life. \n\nAs Sigismund lost all hope of children by his third bride; he was the last male Jagiellon in the direct line so the dynasty was threatened with extinction. He sought to remedy this by adultery with two of the most beautiful of his countrywomen, [[Barbara Giza]] and [[Anna Zaj\u0105czkowska]] but was unable to impregnate either of them. The Sejm was willing to legitimize, and acknowledge as Sigismund's successor, any male heir who might be born to him; however, the King remained childless.\n\nThe King's marriage was a matter of great political import to [[Protestants]] and Catholics alike. The Polish Protestants hoped that he would divorce and remarry and thus bring about a breach with Rome at the very crisis of the religious struggle in Poland. He was not free to remarry until Queen Catherine's death on 28 February 1572, but he followed her to the grave less than six months later.\n\n===Health and final years===\n[[File:Death of Sigismund Augustus at Knyszyn.JPG|thumb|right|''Death of Sigismund II Augustus at [[Knyszyn]]'', by [[Jan Matejko]].]]\nUnlike his father, Sigismund Augustus was more frail and sickly. Shortly before turning 50, his health rapidly declined.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/przypadlosci_krola_zygmunta_augusta.html|title=Przypad\u0142o\u015bci kr\u00f3la Zygmunta Augusta|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}</ref> Being involved in many affairs and holding a large number of mistresses, historians agree that the king had [[venereal disease]] which caused him to be [[infertile]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> At 16, he also contracted [[malaria]] which further contributed to his inability of producing any offspring. By 1558 Sigismund had [[gout]] and since 1568 he also suffered from [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]], which triggered immense pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> He employed numerous medics, healers or even [[Quackery|quack doctors]] and imported expensive [[ointment]]s from Italy. By the end of his life, the king was losing teeth and vigour, possibly due to [[tuberculosis]]. [[Antonio Maria Graziani]] recalls that Sigismund was unable to keep standing without a cane when greeting Cardinal [[Giovanni Francesco Commendone]]. \n\nDuring spring of 1572, Sigismund Augustus became feverish. Untreated tuberculosis made him feeble and impotent, but he was able to travel to his private retreat in [[Knyszyn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/smierc_krola_zygmunta_augusta.html|title=\u015amier\u0107 kr\u00f3la Zygmunta Augusta|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}</ref> While at Knyszyn, he corresponded with his diplomats and nobles, highlighting that he was feeling well and hoped to recover. Great Marshal [[Jan Firlej]] denied these claims and reported that the king was bleeding severely due to [[tuberculosis|consumption]] and was troubled by pain in the chest and [[lumbar]]. \n\n[[File:Nagrobek Zygmunta Starego.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Tomb of Sigismund Augustus in the [[Sigismund Chapel]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Krak\u00f3w, Poland]]\n\nSigismund died in Knyszyn on 7 July 1572 at 6 in the afternoon, surrounded by a group of senators and envoys. The official cause of death given by the medics was consumption. His body placed on a [[catafalque]] and remained at the nearby [[Tykocin Castle]] until 10 September 1573 when it was transported back to Krak\u00f3w through [[Warsaw]]. He was laid to rest at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] on 10 February 1574. The stately funeral ceremony, attended by his sister [[Anna Jagiellon]], was the last spectacle of its kind in the Kingdom of Poland. No other Polish monarch was buried with such pomp and splendour. His death introduced an [[elective monarchy]] in Poland which lasted until the final [[Partitions of Poland|partition]] at the end of the 18th century.\n\nSigismund Augustus was the last male member of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]]. The death of his childless sister, Anna, in 1596 marked the end of the dynasty. \n\nIn addition to his family connections, Sigismund II Augustus was allied to the [[Habsburg]]s as member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Letter of Roxelane to Sigismond Auguste complementing him for his accession to the throne 1549.jpg|thumb|right|Letter from [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], wife of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], to Sigismund Augustus, complimenting him on his accession to the throne, 1549]]\nSigismund's reign was marked by a period of temporary stability and external expansion. He witnessed the bloodless introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]] into Poland and Lithuania, and the ''peero-cratic'' upheaval that placed most political power in the hands of the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]; he saw the collapse of the [[Knights of the Sword]] in the north, which led to the Commonwealth's acquisition of [[Livonia]] as a Lutheran duchy and the consolidation of [[Turkey]]'s power in the southeast. A less imposing figure than his father, the elegant and refined Sigismund II Augustus was nevertheless an even more effective statesman than the stern and majestic [[Sigismund I the Old]].\n\nSigismund II possessed to a high degree the tenacity and patience that seem to have characterized all the [[Jagiellon Dynasty|Jagiellons]], and he added to these qualities a dexterity and diplomatic finesse. No other Polish king seems to have so thoroughly understood the nature of the Polish [[Sejm]] and national assembly. Both the Austrian ambassadors and the papal legates testify to the care with which he controlled his nation. According to diplomats, everything went as Sigismund wished and he seemed to know everything in advance. He managed to obtain more funds from the Sejm than his father ever could, and at one of the parliament sittings he won the hearts of the assembled envoys by unexpectedly appearing in a simple grey coat of a [[Mazovia]]n lord. Like his father, a pro-Austrian by conviction, he contrived even in this respect to carry with him the nation, often distrustful of the [[Germans]]. He also avoided serious complications and skirmishes with the powerful Turks.\n\n===Livonia===\n{{main|Old Livonia|Duchy of Livonia|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Steven van Herwijck, Sigismund II Augustus, 1520-1572, King of Poland 1548 (obverse), c. 1562, NGA 45436.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Medal obverse featuring Sigismund from 1562, [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nDuring Sigismund Augustus' reign, Livonia was in political turmoil. His father, Sigismund I, permitted [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Prussia]] to introduce the [[Protestant Reformation]] and secularize the southern part of the [[Teutonic Order State]]. Albert then established Europe's first Protestant state in the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1525, but under [[Treaty of Cracow|Polish suzerainty]]. However, his efforts to introduce Protestantism to the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] in the northernmost part of the region was met with fierce resistance and divided the [[Livonian Confederation]]. When Albert's brother [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg|Wilhelm]] and [[Archbishopric of Riga|Archbishop of Riga]] attempted to implement a [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Lutheran church order]] in his [[diocese]], the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] estates rebelled and arrested both Wilhelm and his [[Coadjutor bishop|bishop coadjutor]], [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg|Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg]].\n\nAs Prussia was a tributary state of the Polish Crown, Sigismund Augustus, a Catholic, was forced to intervene in favour of Protestant Albert and his brother Wilhelm. In July 1557 the Polish forces left for Livonia. The armed intervention proved to be successful; the Catholic Livonians surrendered and signed the [[Treaty of Pozvol]] on 14 September 1557. The agreement placed most Livonian territories under Polish protection and ''[[de facto]]'' became part of Poland. [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last Master of the Order, was granted the newly established [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]]. Wilhelm was restored to his former position as archbishop on Sigismund's demand, with the Lutheran church order being enacted.\n\nThe incorporation of Courland into the Polish sphere of influence created an alliance which threatened Russia's plans on expanding into the [[Baltic coast]]. Sigismund directed the alliance against [[Ivan the Terrible]] to protect lucrative trade routes in Livonia, thus creating a new valid ''[[casus belli]]'' against the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsardom]]. On 22 January 1558, Ivan invaded the Baltic states and started the [[Livonian War]], which lasted 25 years until 1583. Russia's eventual defeat in the war legally partitioned Livonia between Poland ([[Latvia]], southern [[Estonia]]) and [[Sweden]] (central-northern Estonia). The Polish sector became subsequently known as [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] or ''Inflanty''; it was settled with colonists from Poland proper resulting in systematic [[polonisation]] of these lands.\n\n===Northern Seven Years' War===\n[[File:Zygmunt II August.jpg|thumb|right|Presumed 19th-century depiction of Sigismund Augustus as a founder of Poland's first professional [[Navy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|naval fleet]].]]\nWhen the [[Kalmar Union]] between Sweden and [[Denmark]] was disbanded in 1523 due to Swedish resentment of Danish tyranny, Baltic trade became threatened. The port city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig), Poland's wealthiest city, faced difficulties due to ongoing conflict on the sea and [[piracy]]. The capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], was also affected as the trade route from the Baltic ran through Gda\u0144sk and along the [[Vistula River]] to the southern province of [[Lesser Poland]]. Gda\u0144sk, which was privileged with its own army and government, resisted against Sigismund's order of sending privateers and creating the first Polish Admiralty in their city. Most of the deputies in the city council were merchants and tradesmen of German descent or [[Protestant]]s who were either politically leaning towards Sweden or fighting for the status of an independent '[[city state]]'. 11 Polish privateers sent by Sigismund were eventually executed, which greatly angered the king. Poland then joined Denmark against Sweden for Baltic domination.\n\nThe war ended as ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' in 1570 with the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]], which was signed by Bishop [[Martin Kromer]] on behalf of Sigismund. However, the ineffective conflict did have its input in establishing Poland's first registered [[Navy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|naval fleet]] (Naval Commission) in 1568.\n\n===Union of Lublin===\n{{main|Polish-Lithuanian union|Union of Lublin|Polonisation}}\n[[File:\u017dygimont A\u016dgust. \u0416\u044b\u0433\u0456\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u045e\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 (1645).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous portrait of the king in later life, c. 1645, [[Toru\u0144]].]]\nSigismund's most striking legacy may have been the [[Union of Lublin]], which united Poland and Lithuania into one state, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], jointly with German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] and Prussian cities. This achievement might well have been impossible without the monarch's personal approach to politics and ability to mediate.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |title=Sigismund II. |volume=25 |page=68 |first=Robert Nisbet |last=Bain |authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri25chisrich#page/68/mode/1up}}</ref> \n\nAt first, the treaty was perceived as a threat to Lithuanian sovereignty. Lithuanian [[magnates]] were afraid of losing their powers, since the proposed union would lower their rank and status to an equivalent with [[petty nobility]] rather than wealthier Polish aristocracy. On the other hand, the unification would provide a strong alliance against Russian (Muscovite) attack from the east. Lithuania was ravaged by the [[Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars]] which endured for over 150 years. During the [[Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars#Second war (1500\u20131503)|Second War]], Lithuania lost {{convert|210000|sqmi|km2}} of its territory to Russia, and the final defeat in the [[Livonian War]] would result in the country's incorporation into the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsardom]]. Furthermore, the [[Poles]] were reluctant to aid Lithuania without a ''[[quid pro quo]]''. The most vocal opponent of the union was Sigismund's brother-in-law, [[Miko\u0142aj \"the Red\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] ({{lang-lt|Radvila Rudasis}}), who viewed the agreement as \"peaceful [[annexation]] of Lithuania\" by Poland. He also resisted [[polonisation]] policies which forced ethnic [[Lithuanians]] to change their names and native language to [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\nAs another war with Russia loomed, Sigismund Augustus pressed the members of parliament (Sejm) for the union, gradually gaining more followers due to his persuasive abilities and auspicious diplomacy. The potential union agreement would lead to the eviction of Lithuanian landowners who opposed the transition of territory from multi-ethnic Lithuania to Poland. Such terms were causing an outrage among the most renowned members of Lithuanian upper classes, but Sigismund was decisive and ruthless in this matter. Moreover, the [[Union of Krewo|personal union]] between the two countries created by the marriage of [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] with [[Jogaila]] in 1385 was not entirely constitutional. Being the last male member of the Jagiellons, childless Sigismund sought to preserve his dynasty's legacy. The newly proposed constitutional union would create one large Commonwealth state, with one [[elective monarchy in Poland|elected monarch]] who would simultaneously reign over both domains. \n\n[[File:Sigismund II August of Poland during Lublin Union in 1569.png|thumb|right|[[Union of Lublin]]; Sigismund stands in the center holding a [[crucifix]] among nobles, envoys and the [[clergy]].]]\n\nThe initial Sejm negotiations on unity in January 1569, near the Polish city of [[Lublin]], were futile. The right of Poles to settle and own land in the Grand Duchy was questioned by Lithuanian envoys. Following Miko\u0142aj Radziwi\u0142\u0142's departure from Lublin on 1 March 1569, Sigismund announced the incorporation of then-Lithuanian [[Podlachia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]] and [[Kiev]] provinces into Poland, with strong approval from the local [[Ukrainians|Ruthenian]] (Ukrainian) [[gentry]]. Those historic regions, which once belonged to the [[Kievan Rus']], were disputed between Lithuania and Russia. However, the Ruthenian nobles were eager to capitalise on the political or economic potential offered by the Polish sphere and agreed to the terms. Previously, the [[Kingdom of Ruthenia]] or \"Ukraine\" was abolished in 1349, after Poland and Lithuania split modern-day Ukraine in the aftermath of the [[Galicia\u2013Volhynia Wars]]. Now, under the Union of Lublin, all Ukrainian and Ruthenian territories which were alien in culture, customs, religion and language to the Polish people would be annexed by Catholic Poland. Strong [[westernisation]] and polonisation would follow, including the clandestine suppression of the Ukrainian [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] by future king [[Sigismund III]]. Ruthenia remained under Polish rule until the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack uprisings against Polish domination]] and the [[Partitions of Poland]], when Ukraine was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nThe Lithuanians were compelled to return to the Sejm negotiations under [[Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz|Jan Hieronim Chodkiewicz]] and continue negotiations. The Polish nobility once again pressed for the full incorporation of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] into Poland, however, the Lithuanians disapproved. The parties eventually agreed on a federal state on 28 June 1569 and on 1 July 1569 the Union of Lublin was signed at [[Lublin Castle]], thus establishing the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Sigismund Augustus [[ratification|ratified]] the unification act on 4 July, and henceforth governed one of the largest and multicultural countries of 16th-century Europe.\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Poland|Reformation in Poland}}\n[[File:\u017dygimont A\u016dgust. \u0416\u044b\u0433\u0456\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u045e\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 (1594).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous depiction of Sigismund Augustus from 1594, [[Cologne]]]]\nIn comparison to his staunchly Catholic father, Sigismund Augustus paid little attention to the matters of faith and religion.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=http://muzhp.pl/pl/c/1764/geneza-upadek-i-dziedzictwo-reformacji-w-polsce-wywiad-z-prof-januszem-t-maciuszka|title=Geneza, upadek i dziedzictwo reformacji w Polsce \u2013 wywiad z prof.

His initiative was chiefly inspired by the creation of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] by [[Henry VIII]] in 1534. Sigismund Augustus was lenient towards the idea, particularly due to the sudden spread of Protestantism among courtiers, advisors, nobles and peasants. Calvinism became especially popular among the upper classes as it promoted [[Democracy|democratic]] freedoms and called for rebellion against [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]], which the privileged Polish nobility favoured. During the 1555 Sejm session in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]], the nobles intensively discussed the rights of priests in the newly proposed Polish Church and demanded the abolition of [[celibacy]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://kurierhistoryczny.pl/artykul/krol-niczym-papiez-czyli-co-by-bylo-gdyby-powstal-polski-kosciol-narodowy,149|title=Kr\u00f3l niczym papie\u017c, czyli co by by\u0142o gdyby powsta\u0142 Polski Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Narodowy|website=Kurier Historyczny}}</ref> Some Catholic bishops were supportive of the concepts and acknowledged the need for uniting Poland, Lithuania, Prussia and their [[vassals]] under a common religion.

He was the first ruler of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the last male monarch from the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]].\n\nSigismund was the only legitimate son of Italian-born [[Bona Sforza]] and Sigismund the Old. From the beginning he was groomed and extensively educated as a successor. In 1529 he was crowned ''[[vivente rege]]'' while his father was still alive. Sigismund Augustus continued a tolerance policy towards minorities and maintained peaceful relations with neighbouring countries, with the exception of the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] which aimed to secure [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] trade. Under his patronage the culture flourished in Poland; he was a collector of tapestries from the [[Low Countries]] and collected military memorabilia as well as swords, armours and jewellery. Sigismund Augustus' rule is widely considered as the apex of the [[Polish Golden Age]]; he established the first regular Polish navy and the first regular [[post|postal service]] in Poland, known today as [[Poczta Polska]]. In 1569 he oversaw the signing of the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which formed the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and introduced an [[elective monarchy]].  \n\nSigismund Augustus married three times; his first wife, [[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth of Austria]], died in 1545 at just eighteen. He was then involved in several relationships with mistresses, the most famous being [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], who became Sigismund's second wife and Queen of Poland in spite of his mother's disapproval. The marriage was deemed scandalous and was fiercely opposed by the royal court and the [[Szlachta|nobility]]. Barbara died five months after her coronation, presumably due to ill health, however, rumours circulated that she was poisoned. Sigismund finally wedded [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Poland|Catherine of Austria]], but remained childless throughout his life. \n\nSigismund Augustus was last male member of the [[Jagiellons]]. Following the death of his sister [[Anna Jagiellon|Anna]] in 1596 the Jagiellonian dynasty came to an end.\n\n==Royal titles==\n* Royal titles, in [[Latin]]: \"''Sigismundus Augustus, Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, nec non terrarum Cracoviae, Sandomiriae, Siradiae, Lanciciae, Cuiaviae, Kiioviae, dominus hereditarius Russiae, Woliniae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Podlachiae, Culmensis, Elbingensis, Pomeraniae, Samogitiae, Livoniae etc. dominus et heres''.\"\n* English translation: \"Sigismund Augustus, by the Grace of God, King of [[Poland]], Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], Lord and heir of the Lands of [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Sieradz]], [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Kiev]], Hereditary Lord of [[Ruthenia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Podlaskie]], [[Culmer Land]], [[Elbing]], [[Pomerania]], [[Samogitia]], [[Duchy of Livonia|Livonia]] etc. Lord and heir\"\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Royal armoury Stockholm 1.jpg|thumb|left|Parade [[armour]] of King Sigismund Augustus, made in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Kunz Lochner]], 1550s. [[Livrustkammaren]] in [[Stockholm]].]]\nSigismund Augustus was born in Krak\u00f3w on 1 August 1520 to Sigismund I the Old and his wife, [[Bona Sforza]] of [[Milan]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], King of Poland, and [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436\u20131505)|Elizabeth of Austria]]. Sigismund's maternal grandparents, [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]] and [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], daughter of King [[Alfonso II of Naples]], both [[List of rulers of Milan|ruled]] the [[Duchy of Milan]] until Sforza's suspicious death in 1494. \n\nThroughout his youth, Sigismund Augustus was under the careful watch of his mother, Bona. Being the only legitimate male heir to the Polish throne throughout his father's reign, he was well educated and taught by the most renowned scholars in the country. It was also his mother's wish to name her only son Augustus, after the first [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Gaius Octavius Augustus]]. However, this decision was met with Sigismund the Old's strong disapproval, who hoped for a lineage of Sigismunds on the Polish throne. Consequently, it was established that the child will bear two names to settle the conflict. The tradition of adopting Augustus as a second or middle name was also observed during the [[coronation]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw Antoni Poniatowski]] who became King Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus in 1764.\n\nIn 1530, the ten-year-old Sigismund Augustus was crowned by [[Primate of Poland|Primate]] [[Jan \u0141aski (1456\u20131531)|Jan \u0141aski]] as co-ruler alongside his father, in accordance with the ''[[vivente rege]]'' law. Sigismund the Old hoped to secure his son's succession to the throne and maintain the Jagiellonian dynasty's position in Poland. The move was crucial to silence the members of nobility who were against the Jagiellons and viewed the action as a step towards [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. The law was officially abolished by the [[Henrician Articles]], or the new constitution adopted between nobles and the newly elected king [[Henry III of France|Henry de Valois]] in 1573.\n\n===First marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger Elizabeth of Austria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth Habsburg]], Queen of Poland, by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]]]]\nWhen Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned, Chancellor [[Krzysztof Szyd\u0142owiecki]] organized a preliminary marriage treaty between the young king and [[Elizabeth of Austria (1526\u20131545)|Elizabeth Habsburg]], daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]]. The marriage was signed on 10\u201311 November 1530 in [[Pozna\u0144]], however, the arrangement was delayed by Queen Bona Sforza, who detested the new bride. The treaty was renewed on 16 June 1538 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] by [[Johannes Dantiscus]] and the betrothal ceremony took place on 17 July 1538 in [[Innsbruck]]. Bona continued to lobby against the marriage and instead proposed Princess [[Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry|Margaret of France]] to potentially form an alliance with the French against the [[Habsburgs]]. \n\nOn 5 May 1543, Elizabeth's escorted convoy entered Krak\u00f3w and was greeted with enthusiasm by both the nobles and the townsfolk. The same day 16-year-old Elizabeth married 22-year-old Sigismund Augustus, whom she met for the first time shortly before marriage vows. The ceremony was performed at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] and the wedding continued for two weeks. As Elizabeth was granted the title of Queen, her mother-in-law Bona began to plot against the new monarchess. As a result, the newly wedded couple decided to reside in [[Vilnius]], far from the royal court.\n\nDespite the initial euphoria demonstrated by royal subjects, the marriage was unsuccessful from the very beginning. Sigismund Augustus did not find Elizabeth attractive and continued to have extramarital affairs with several mistresses, the most famous being [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. Elizabeth was also known to be timid, meek and apprehensive due to strict upbringing. The young and garrulous king was also repulsed by Elizabeth's newly diagnosed [[epilepsy]] and subsequent seizures. Only Sigismund the Old and some nobles showed compassion towards the new Queen, who was disregarded by her husband and scorned by Bona. Sigismund Augustus was indifferent to her health condition; when the seizures continued to intensify he abandoned Elizabeth and returned to Krak\u00f3w to collect her [[dowry]]. He also sent for Ferdinand's doctors to travel the long distance from [[Vienna]] knowing that Elizabeth was ailing and deteriorating fast. She eventually died unattended and exhausted from the epileptic attacks on 15 June 1545 at the age of 18.\n\n===Second marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142 by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (ca. 1553]]\nFrom the outset of his reign, Sigismund Augustus came into collision with the country's privileged [[Szlachta|nobility]], who had already begun curtailing the power of the great families. The ostensible cause of the nobility's animosity to the King was his second marriage, secretly contracted before his accession to the throne, with the [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Calvinist]] and former mistress, [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], the daughter of [[Hetman]] [[Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. The marriage was announced by the king himself on 2 February 1548 in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski]]. \n\nThe young and beautiful Barbara was despised by dowager Queen Bona, who attempted to annul the marriage at any cost. The agitation was also abundant at Sigismund's first [[Sejm]] (parliament) sitting on 31 October 1548 where the deputies threatened to renounce their allegiance unless the new king repudiated Barbara. The nobles portrayed Barbara as an opportunistic prostitute that charmed the king for her own benefit. That perception was shared with Bona Sforza, who decisively eliminated all her rivals by any means to stay in power. The young monarch even considered [[abdication|abdicating]]. By 1550, when Sigismund summoned his second Sejm, the nobles had begun to be in his favor; the nobility was rebuked by Marshal [[Piotr Kmita Sobie\u0144ski]], who accused them of attempting to unduly diminish the legislative prerogatives of the Polish Crown. Furthermore, Bona was removed from [[Wawel Castle|Wawel]] and sent to [[Mazovia]] where she established her own small courtly entourage.<ref>Duczmal (2012), p. 119</ref> \n\n[[File:Zygmunt August i Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna.jpg|thumb|left|Sigismund and Barbara attended by courtiers.

On the other hand, she was ambitious, intelligent, perceptive and had an exemplar taste in fashion. She always wore precious pearl necklaces when sitting for portraits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historia.org.pl/2016/05/30/barbara-radziwillowna-wielka-milosc-zygmunta-augusta/|title=Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna - wielka mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 Zygmunta Augusta &#124; HISTORIA.org.pl - historia, kultura, muzea, matura, rekonstrukcje i recenzje historyczne|first=Milena|last=pisze|date=30 May 2016}}</ref> The mutual admiration between Sigismund and Barbara made the relationship \"one of the greatest love affairs in Polish history\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,17158033,Barbara_Radziwillowna_i_Zygmunt_August__Najwiekszy.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Wyborcza.pl|website=wyborcza.pl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2019/03/03/zygmunt-august-i-barbara-radziwillowna-jak-naprawde-krol-traktowal-swoja-ukochana/|title=By\u0142 dla niej najgorszym \u0142ajdakiem i \u015bwini\u0105.

To ease the situation, Sigismund Augustus provided a luxurious lifestyle and expensive gifts for his wife at [[Wawel Castle]] since her arrival in Krak\u00f3w on 13 February 1549. The monarch also granted Barbara several provinces to administer and provide income. Although ambitious and bright, she showed lack of interest in political life, but had some influence over decisions made by Sigismund. This also caused an uproar among the nobility. To avoid an armed rebellion, Sigismund was forced to form an alliance with his former father-in-law, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of the Holy Roman Empire]]. This allowed for Barbara's coronation as Queen of Poland on 7 December 1550 by Primate [[Miko\u0142aj Dzierzgowski]]. Queen dowager Bona eventually succumbed to her son's demand and accepted the marriage.\n\n[[File:Simmler Death of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142.jpg|thumb|225px|''Death of Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142'', painting by [[J\u00f3zef Simmler]].]]\n\nSince the day Sigismund and Barbara met, she complained of poor health, particularly stomach and abdominal pain. After the coronation her condition deteriorated rapidly. She was tormented by strong fever, diarrhea, [[nausea]] and lack of appetite. After careful observation by hired medics, a lump was discovered on her stomach filled with pus. Sigismund Augustus gravely despaired and sent for doctors and even folk healers from the entire country. He personally tended to his sick wife despite her foul smell and dedicated himself when necessary; the king hoped to take Barbara to the hunting castle at [[Niepo\u0142omice]] and ordered to demolish the small city gate so her carriage could pass freely. However, Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in [[Krak\u00f3w]] after continuous pain and agony. It was her dying wish that she'd be buried in Lithuania, her homeland. The body was transported to [[Vilnius Cathedral]], where she was finally buried on 23 June next to Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a major blow to Sigismund; he often attended her coffin on foot while being transported to Vilnius in hot weather. Sigismund also became more serious and reserved; he avoided balls, temporarily renounced his mistresses and dressed black until death.\n\nThe cause of Barbara's death is debatable. Her opponents and family members suggested [[sexually transmitted disease]]s due to a number of affairs she had before marrying Sigismund. There were also persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Queen Bona Sforza, who had a long history of eliminating her rivals or enemies quickly and efficiently. However, contemporary historians and experts agree on [[Cervical cancer|cervical]] or [[ovarian cancer]].\n\n===Third marriage===\n[[File:Cranach the Younger  Catherine of Austria.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Catherine of Austria by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]].]]\n\nThe death of Queen Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, five months after her coronation and under distressing circumstances, compelled Sigismund to contract a third, purely political union with his first cousin, the Austrian archduchess [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Poland|Catherine]], to avoid an Austro-Russian alliance. She was also the sister of his first wife, Elizabeth, who had died within a year of her marriage to him, before his accession. Catherine, unlike previous queens, was considered dull and obese. Sigismund Augustus found her immensely unattractive despite accepting the marriage and organizing a pompous wedding ceremony on 30 July 1553. On the other hand, Catherine showed resentment towards Sigismund because of how he treated her sister and first wife, Queen Elizabeth. She accused him of negligence and indifference during her sudden illness, which caused premature death. The correspondence between the two remained purely formal and political for the remainder of their lives. \n\nSince her coronation, Catherine acted as Austria's puppet at the Polish court; she was tasked with [[espionage]] and obtaining important information for the benefit of the Habsburgs. Sigismund Augustus was aware of the scheme, but, by marrying Catherine, Austria promised to stay neutral and abandon plans with Russia. This neutrality was undermined by Catherine's actions, who followed her father's policy and objected the return of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]] and [[Isabella Jagiellon]] (Sigismund's sister) to Hungary. She would conspire with the Habsburg envoys prior to an audience with the king. She would also dictate what and how the envoys should express their views. When Sigismund Augustus found out of Catherine's intrigues, he sent her to [[Radom]] and excluded from political life. \n\nAs Sigismund lost all hope of children by his third bride; he was the last male Jagiellon in the direct line so the dynasty was threatened with extinction. He sought to remedy this by adultery with two of the most beautiful of his countrywomen, [[Barbara Giza]] and [[Anna Zaj\u0105czkowska]] but was unable to impregnate either of them. The Sejm was willing to legitimize, and acknowledge as Sigismund's successor, any male heir who might be born to him; however, the King remained childless.\n\nThe King's marriage was a matter of great political import to [[Protestants]] and Catholics alike. The Polish Protestants hoped that he would divorce and remarry and thus bring about a breach with Rome at the very crisis of the religious struggle in Poland. He was not free to remarry until Queen Catherine's death on 28 February 1572, but he followed her to the grave less than six months later.\n\n===Health and final years===\n[[File:Death of Sigismund Augustus at Knyszyn.JPG|thumb|right|''Death of Sigismund II Augustus at [[Knyszyn]]'', by [[Jan Matejko]].]]\nUnlike his father, Sigismund Augustus was more frail and sickly. Shortly before turning 50, his health rapidly declined.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/przypadlosci_krola_zygmunta_augusta.html|title=Przypad\u0142o\u015bci kr\u00f3la Zygmunta Augusta|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}</ref> Being involved in many affairs and holding a large number of mistresses, historians agree that the king had [[venereal disease]] which caused him to be [[infertile]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> At 16, he also contracted [[malaria]] which further contributed to his inability of producing any offspring. By 1558 Sigismund had [[gout]] and since 1568 he also suffered from [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]], which triggered immense pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> He employed numerous medics, healers or even [[Quackery|quack doctors]] and imported expensive [[ointment]]s from Italy. By the end of his life, the king was losing teeth and vigour, possibly due to [[tuberculosis]]. [[Antonio Maria Graziani]] recalls that Sigismund was unable to keep standing without a cane when greeting Cardinal [[Giovanni Francesco Commendone]]. \n\nDuring spring of 1572, Sigismund Augustus became feverish. Untreated tuberculosis made him feeble and impotent, but he was able to travel to his private retreat in [[Knyszyn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/smierc_krola_zygmunta_augusta.html|title=\u015amier\u0107 kr\u00f3la Zygmunta Augusta|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}</ref> While at Knyszyn, he corresponded with his diplomats and nobles, highlighting that he was feeling well and hoped to recover. Great Marshal [[Jan Firlej]] denied these claims and reported that the king was bleeding severely due to [[tuberculosis|consumption]] and was troubled by pain in the chest and [[lumbar]]. \n\n[[File:Nagrobek Zygmunta Starego.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Tomb of Sigismund Augustus in the [[Sigismund Chapel]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Krak\u00f3w, Poland]]\n\nSigismund died in Knyszyn on 7 July 1572 at 6 in the afternoon, surrounded by a group of senators and envoys. The official cause of death given by the medics was consumption. His body placed on a [[catafalque]] and remained at the nearby [[Tykocin Castle]] until 10 September 1573 when it was transported back to Krak\u00f3w through [[Warsaw]]. He was laid to rest at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] on 10 February 1574. The stately funeral ceremony, attended by his sister [[Anna Jagiellon]], was the last spectacle of its kind in the Kingdom of Poland. No other Polish monarch was buried with such pomp and splendour. His death introduced an [[elective monarchy]] in Poland which lasted until the final [[Partitions of Poland|partition]] at the end of the 18th century.\n\nSigismund Augustus was the last male member of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]]. The death of his childless sister, Anna, in 1596 marked the end of the dynasty. \n\nIn addition to his family connections, Sigismund II Augustus was allied to the [[Habsburg]]s as member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Letter of Roxelane to Sigismond Auguste complementing him for his accession to the throne 1549.jpg|thumb|right|Letter from [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], wife of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], to Sigismund Augustus, complimenting him on his accession to the throne, 1549]]\nSigismund's reign was marked by a period of temporary stability and external expansion. He witnessed the bloodless introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]] into Poland and Lithuania, and the ''peero-cratic'' upheaval that placed most political power in the hands of the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]; he saw the collapse of the [[Knights of the Sword]] in the north, which led to the Commonwealth's acquisition of [[Livonia]] as a Lutheran duchy and the consolidation of [[Turkey]]'s power in the southeast. A less imposing figure than his father, the elegant and refined Sigismund II Augustus was nevertheless an even more effective statesman than the stern and majestic [[Sigismund I the Old]].\n\nSigismund II possessed to a high degree the tenacity and patience that seem to have characterized all the [[Jagiellon Dynasty|Jagiellons]], and he added to these qualities a dexterity and diplomatic finesse. No other Polish king seems to have so thoroughly understood the nature of the Polish [[Sejm]] and national assembly. Both the Austrian ambassadors and the papal legates testify to the care with which he controlled his nation. According to diplomats, everything went as Sigismund wished and he seemed to know everything in advance. He managed to obtain more funds from the Sejm than his father ever could, and at one of the parliament sittings he won the hearts of the assembled envoys by unexpectedly appearing in a simple grey coat of a [[Mazovia]]n lord. Like his father, a pro-Austrian by conviction, he contrived even in this respect to carry with him the nation, often distrustful of the [[Germans]]. He also avoided serious complications and skirmishes with the powerful Turks.\n\n===Livonia===\n{{main|Old Livonia|Duchy of Livonia|Livonian War}}\n[[File:Steven van Herwijck, Sigismund II Augustus, 1520-1572, King of Poland 1548 (obverse), c. 1562, NGA 45436.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Medal obverse featuring Sigismund from 1562, [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nDuring Sigismund Augustus' reign, Livonia was in political turmoil. His father, Sigismund I, permitted [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Prussia]] to introduce the [[Protestant Reformation]] and secularize the southern part of the [[Teutonic Order State]]. Albert then established Europe's first Protestant state in the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1525, but under [[Treaty of Cracow|Polish suzerainty]]. However, his efforts to introduce Protestantism to the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] in the northernmost part of the region was met with fierce resistance and divided the [[Livonian Confederation]]. When Albert's brother [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg|Wilhelm]] and [[Archbishopric of Riga|Archbishop of Riga]] attempted to implement a [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Lutheran church order]] in his [[diocese]], the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] estates rebelled and arrested both Wilhelm and his [[Coadjutor bishop|bishop coadjutor]], [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg|Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg]].\n\nAs Prussia was a tributary state of the Polish Crown, Sigismund Augustus, a Catholic, was forced to intervene in favour of Protestant Albert and his brother Wilhelm. In July 1557 the Polish forces left for Livonia. The armed intervention proved to be successful; the Catholic Livonians surrendered and signed the [[Treaty of Pozvol]] on 14 September 1557. The agreement placed most Livonian territories under Polish protection and ''[[de facto]]'' became part of Poland. [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last Master of the Order, was granted the newly established [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]]. Wilhelm was restored to his former position as archbishop on Sigismund's demand, with the Lutheran church order being enacted.\n\nThe incorporation of Courland into the Polish sphere of influence created an alliance which threatened Russia's plans on expanding into the [[Baltic coast]]. Sigismund directed the alliance against [[Ivan the Terrible]] to protect lucrative trade routes in Livonia, thus creating a new valid ''[[casus belli]]'' against the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsardom]]. On 22 January 1558, Ivan invaded the Baltic states and started the [[Livonian War]], which lasted 25 years until 1583. Russia's eventual defeat in the war legally partitioned Livonia between Poland ([[Latvia]], southern [[Estonia]]) and [[Sweden]] (central-northern Estonia). The Polish sector became subsequently known as [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] or ''Inflanty''; it was settled with colonists from Poland proper resulting in systematic [[polonisation]] of these lands.\n\n===Northern Seven Years' War===\n[[File:Zygmunt II August.jpg|thumb|right|Presumed 19th-century depiction of Sigismund Augustus as a founder of Poland's first professional [[Navy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|naval fleet]].]]\nWhen the [[Kalmar Union]] between Sweden and [[Denmark]] was disbanded in 1523 due to Swedish resentment of Danish tyranny, Baltic trade became threatened. The port city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig), Poland's wealthiest city, faced difficulties due to ongoing conflict on the sea and [[piracy]]. The capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], was also affected as the trade route from the Baltic ran through Gda\u0144sk and along the [[Vistula River]] to the southern province of [[Lesser Poland]]. Gda\u0144sk, which was privileged with its own army and government, resisted against Sigismund's order of sending privateers and creating the first Polish Admiralty in their city. Most of the deputies in the city council were merchants and tradesmen of German descent or [[Protestant]]s who were either politically leaning towards Sweden or fighting for the status of an independent '[[city state]]'. 11 Polish privateers sent by Sigismund were eventually executed, which greatly angered the king. Poland then joined Denmark against Sweden for Baltic domination.\n\nThe war ended as ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' in 1570 with the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]], which was signed by Bishop [[Martin Kromer]] on behalf of Sigismund. However, the ineffective conflict did have its input in establishing Poland's first registered [[Navy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|naval fleet]] (Naval Commission) in 1568.\n\n===Union of Lublin===\n{{main|Polish-Lithuanian union|Union of Lublin|Polonisation}}\n[[File:\u017dygimont A\u016dgust. \u0416\u044b\u0433\u0456\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u045e\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 (1645).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous portrait of the king in later life, c. 1645, [[Toru\u0144]].]]\nSigismund's most striking legacy may have been the [[Union of Lublin]], which united Poland and Lithuania into one state, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], jointly with German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] and Prussian cities. This achievement might well have been impossible without the monarch's personal approach to politics and ability to mediate.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |title=Sigismund II. |volume=25 |page=68 |first=Robert Nisbet |last=Bain |authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri25chisrich#page/68/mode/1up}}</ref> \n\nAt first, the treaty was perceived as a threat to Lithuanian sovereignty. Lithuanian [[magnates]] were afraid of losing their powers, since the proposed union would lower their rank and status to an equivalent with [[petty nobility]] rather than wealthier Polish aristocracy. On the other hand, the unification would provide a strong alliance against Russian (Muscovite) attack from the east. Lithuania was ravaged by the [[Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars]] which endured for over 150 years. During the [[Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars#Second war (1500\u20131503)|Second War]], Lithuania lost {{convert|210000|sqmi|km2}} of its territory to Russia, and the final defeat in the [[Livonian War]] would result in the country's incorporation into the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsardom]]. Furthermore, the [[Poles]] were reluctant to aid Lithuania without a ''[[quid pro quo]]''. The most vocal opponent of the union was Sigismund's brother-in-law, [[Miko\u0142aj \"the Red\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] ({{lang-lt|Radvila Rudasis}}), who viewed the agreement as \"peaceful [[annexation]] of Lithuania\" by Poland. He also resisted [[polonisation]] policies which forced ethnic [[Lithuanians]] to change their names and native language to [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\nAs another war with Russia loomed, Sigismund Augustus pressed the members of parliament (Sejm) for the union, gradually gaining more followers due to his persuasive abilities and auspicious diplomacy. The potential union agreement would lead to the eviction of Lithuanian landowners who opposed the transition of territory from multi-ethnic Lithuania to Poland. Such terms were causing an outrage among the most renowned members of Lithuanian upper classes, but Sigismund was decisive and ruthless in this matter. Moreover, the [[Union of Krewo|personal union]] between the two countries created by the marriage of [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] with [[Jogaila]] in 1385 was not entirely constitutional. Being the last male member of the Jagiellons, childless Sigismund sought to preserve his dynasty's legacy. The newly proposed constitutional union would create one large Commonwealth state, with one [[elective monarchy in Poland|elected monarch]] who would simultaneously reign over both domains. \n\n[[File:Sigismund II August of Poland during Lublin Union in 1569.png|thumb|right|[[Union of Lublin]]; Sigismund stands in the center holding a [[crucifix]] among nobles, envoys and the [[clergy]].]]\n\nThe initial Sejm negotiations on unity in January 1569, near the Polish city of [[Lublin]], were futile. The right of Poles to settle and own land in the Grand Duchy was questioned by Lithuanian envoys. Following Miko\u0142aj Radziwi\u0142\u0142's departure from Lublin on 1 March 1569, Sigismund announced the incorporation of then-Lithuanian [[Podlachia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]] and [[Kiev]] provinces into Poland, with strong approval from the local [[Ukrainians|Ruthenian]] (Ukrainian) [[gentry]]. Those historic regions, which once belonged to the [[Kievan Rus']], were disputed between Lithuania and Russia. However, the Ruthenian nobles were eager to capitalise on the political or economic potential offered by the Polish sphere and agreed to the terms. Previously, the [[Kingdom of Ruthenia]] or \"Ukraine\" was abolished in 1349, after Poland and Lithuania split modern-day Ukraine in the aftermath of the [[Galicia\u2013Volhynia Wars]]. Now, under the Union of Lublin, all Ukrainian and Ruthenian territories which were alien in culture, customs, religion and language to the Polish people would be annexed by Catholic Poland. Strong [[westernisation]] and polonisation would follow, including the clandestine suppression of the Ukrainian [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] by future king [[Sigismund III]]. Ruthenia remained under Polish rule until the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack uprisings against Polish domination]] and the [[Partitions of Poland]], when Ukraine was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nThe Lithuanians were compelled to return to the Sejm negotiations under [[Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz|Jan Hieronim Chodkiewicz]] and continue negotiations. The Polish nobility once again pressed for the full incorporation of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] into Poland, however, the Lithuanians disapproved. The parties eventually agreed on a federal state on 28 June 1569 and on 1 July 1569 the Union of Lublin was signed at [[Lublin Castle]], thus establishing the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Sigismund Augustus [[ratification|ratified]] the unification act on 4 July, and henceforth governed one of the largest and multicultural countries of 16th-century Europe.\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Poland|Reformation in Poland}}\n[[File:\u017dygimont A\u016dgust. \u0416\u044b\u0433\u0456\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u045e\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 (1594).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Posthumous depiction of Sigismund Augustus from 1594, [[Cologne]]]]\nIn comparison to his staunchly Catholic father, Sigismund Augustus paid little attention to the matters of faith and religion.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=http://muzhp.pl/pl/c/1764/geneza-upadek-i-dziedzictwo-reformacji-w-polsce-wywiad-z-prof-januszem-t-maciuszka|title=Geneza, upadek i dziedzictwo reformacji w Polsce \u2013 wywiad z prof.

His initiative was chiefly inspired by the creation of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] by [[Henry VIII]] in 1534. Sigismund Augustus was lenient towards the idea, particularly due to the sudden spread of Protestantism among courtiers, advisors, nobles and peasants. Calvinism became especially popular among the upper classes as it promoted [[Democracy|democratic]] freedoms and called for rebellion against [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]], which the privileged Polish nobility favoured. During the 1555 Sejm session in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]], the nobles intensively discussed the rights of priests in the newly proposed Polish Church and demanded the abolition of [[celibacy]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://kurierhistoryczny.pl/artykul/krol-niczym-papiez-czyli-co-by-bylo-gdyby-powstal-polski-kosciol-narodowy,149|title=Kr\u00f3l niczym papie\u017c, czyli co by by\u0142o gdyby powsta\u0142 Polski Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Narodowy|website=Kurier Historyczny}}</ref> Some Catholic bishops were supportive of the concepts and acknowledged the need for uniting Poland, Lithuania, Prussia and their [[vassals]] under a common religion.
