Jamaica became a [[Crown colony]] in 1866.\n\n== 17th century ==\n\n===English conquest===\n{{Main|Invasion of Jamaica}}\n\nIn late 1654, English leader [[Oliver Cromwell]] launched the ''Western Design'' armada against [[Spanish West Indies|Spain's colonies in the Caribbean]].  In April 1655, [[Robert Venables|General Robert Venables]] led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at [[Santo Domingo]], [[Hispaniola]]. However, the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, known as the [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|Siege of Santo Domingo]], and the English troops were soon decimated by disease. {{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=29}} {{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=24}}{{sfn|Coward|2002|p=134}}\n\nWeakened by fever and looking for an easy victory following their defeat at Santo Domingo, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. [[Spanish Jamaica]] had been a colony of Spain for over a hundred years. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's [[Spanish Town]] capital.  The English invasion force soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica, and in response in 1657 the English Governor of Jamaica invited [[buccaneer]]s to base themselves at [[Port Royal]] on Santiago, to help defend against Spanish attacks.  Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the [[Battle of Ocho Rios (1657)|Battle of Ocho Rios]] in 1657 and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo (1658)|Battle of Rio Nuevo]] in 1658. Governor [[Edward D'Oyley]] succeeded in persuading one of the leaders of the Spanish Maroons, [[Juan de Bolas]], to switch sides and join the English along with his Maroon warriors. In 1660, when Don Cristobal de Ysasi realised that de Bolas had joined the English, he admitted that the Spanish no longer had a chance of recapturing the island, since de Bolas and his men knew the mountainous interior better than the Spanish and the English. Ysasi gave up on his dreams, and fled to Cuba.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-20.</ref><ref>C.V. Black, ''History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), p. 54.</ref> \n\nFor England, Jamaica was to be the 'dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire,' although in fact it was a possession of little economic value then.{{sfn|Coward|2002|p=134}}\n\n===Early British colonisation===\nCromwell increased the island's white population by sending indentured servants and prisoners captured [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|in battles with]] the [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]], as well as some common criminals.<ref>Black, ''History'', p. 51.</ref> This practice was continued under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and the white population was also augmented by immigrants from the [[British America|North American mainland]] and other islands, as well as by the English [[buccaneer]]s. But [[tropical diseases]] kept the number of whites well under 10,000 until about 1740. The white population increased, through migration from Britain, to 80,000 in the 1780s.<ref>Christer Petley, ''White Fury'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 24.</ref>\n\nAlthough the slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded roughly 9,500, by the end of the seventeenth century [[Slave trade|imports]] of [[slave]]s increased the [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|black population]] to at least three times the number of whites.<ref>Orlando Patterson, ''Sociology of Slavery'' (Kingston: Sangster's, 1973), p. 95.</ref> In the eighteenth century, the population of black slaves in Jamaica increased significantly from one decade to the next, despite the fact that the slave ships coming from the west coast of [[Africa]] preferred to unload at the islands of the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but this population rose to about 75,000 in 1730, and passed the 100,000 mark in the 1740s. In 1778, the black slave population passed 200,000, and by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.<ref>Patterson, ''Sociology'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nBeginning with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchy's appointment of a civil [[Governor of Jamaica|governor]] to Jamaica in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the twentieth century. The second governor, [[Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]], brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a Crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]].<ref>Black, ''History of Jamaica'', p. 55.</ref>\n\nEngland gained formal possession of Jamaica from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1670 through the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]].<ref>Black, ''History'', p. 69.</ref> Removing the pressing need for constant defence against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to [[Plantation economy|planting]]. For years, however, the planter-dominated Jamaica House of Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and [[James II of England|James II]] and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company. The [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|last Stuart governor]], the [[Duke of Albemarle]], who was more interested in [[treasure hunting]] than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to [[London]], succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement and the revolution that brought [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to the throne in 1689 confirmed the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the Assembly.<ref>Black, ''History'', pp. 72-3.</ref> This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. This was of particular importance during the [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|Anglo-French War]] in the Caribbean from 1689 to 1713.\n\nHowever, even though the Spaniards no longer threatened Jamaica, the early English settlers had to ward off attacks from the French. In 1694, [[Jean-Baptiste du Casse]] led a force of three warships and 29 transport ships that landed at [[Port Morant]] in eastern Jamaica, where they burnt plantations, destroyed over 50 sugar-works, kidnapped hundreds of slaves, and killed and tortured many white colonists. Du Casse then sailed down the southern coast, eventually landing at Carlisle Bay, with the object of marching on to [[Spanish Town]]. However, a militia company of planters and their slaves defeated du Casse, who then destroyed Carlisle Bay, and withdrew to [[St Domingue]].<ref>Black, ''History of Jamaica'', pp. 74-5.</ref> \n\nThe sugar monoculture and slave-worked [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] society spread across Jamaica throughout the eighteenth century.\n\n===Maroons===\n{{Main|Jamaican Maroons#History}}\n\nWhen the British captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three ''Palenques'', or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of [[Juan de Serras]] allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the [[Cockpit Country]], while those under [[Juan de Bolas]] established themselves in modern-day [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica]] and served as a \"black militia\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the [[Arawak]] people. Each group of [[Jamaican Maroons]] established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainsbury|first1=W.

The English colonial authorities sent local militia and English army units against them, but the Maroons successfully fought a guerrilla campaign against them in the mountainous interior, and forced the British government to seek peace terms to end the expensive conflict. In the second half of the seventeenth century, de Serras fought regular campaigns against the English forces, even attacking the capital of [[Spanish Town]], and he was never defeated by the English.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-35.</ref>\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, English-speaking escaped [[Akan people|Akan]] slaves were at the forefront of the Maroon fighting against the British. [[Cudjoe]] led the Leeward Maroons in western Jamaica, while [[Quao]] and [[Queen Nanny]] were the leaders of the Windward Maroons in the Blue Mountains of eastern Jamaica. The [[First Maroon War|rebellion]] finally ended, however, with the signing of peace agreements in 1739 and 1740.<ref>Craton, Michael. ''Testing the Chains''.

The English established their main coastal town at [[Port Royal]]. \nUnder early [[Kingdom of England|English]] rule, Jamaica became a haven of [[privateer]]s, [[buccaneer]]s, and occasionally outright [[pirate]]s: [[Christopher Myngs]], [[Edward Mansvelt]], and most famously, [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>Black, ''History'', pp. 55-71.</ref>\n\nIn addition to being unable to retake their land, Spain was no longer able to provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods on a regular basis. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing desperation by colonies for manufactured goods, allowed Port Royal to flourish and by 1659, two hundred houses, shops, and warehouses surrounded the fort.  Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as \"forced trade.\" Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish while sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns.<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/> While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation.  Nuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, wrote, \"Both opponents and advocates of so-called \u2018forced trade\u2019 declared the town\u2019s fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers\u2019 needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\">Nuala Zahedieh, \"Trade, Plunder, and Economic Development in Early English Jamaica, 1655\u201389,\" ''The Economic History Review'' 39, no. 2 (1986): 205\u2013222.</ref> She added, \"A report that the 300 men who accompanied Henry Morgan to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least \u00a360 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nThe forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote \"...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.\"<ref>Michael Pawson and David Buisseret, ''Port Royal, Jamaica'' (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 2000).</ref> Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of [[sugarcane]]. Zahedieh wrote, \"The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth \u00a375,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island\u2019s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed \u00a310,000 at this time.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nHowever, many successful privateers and buccaneers became integrally involved in the growing sugar industry, and its acquisition of large number of African slaves. In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of a large slave plantation, Morgan led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of Morgan and his forces.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 23, 32-3.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Old Port Royal - Project Gutenberg eText 19396.png|An illustration of pre-1692 Port Royal\nFile:Henry Morgan in colour.jpg|Henry Morgan, governor of Jamaica\nFile:Jamaica1671ogilby.jpg|English map of Jamaica from the 1670s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaica1671ogilby.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222101724/http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaica1671ogilby.html |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nFile:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|European colonies in the Caribbean during the 18th century\n</gallery>\n\n===1692 earthquake and the collapse of Port Royal===\n{{Main|1692 Jamaica earthquake}}\n\nOn 7 June 1692, a violent [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake]] struck Port Royal.

Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] to sugar cane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. [[Sugar]] was quickly snapped up by the [[Great Britain|British]], who used it in [[cake]]s and to sweeten [[tea]]s.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, sugar replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as Jamaica's main source of income and Jamaica became the largest exporter of sugar in the British Empire.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNM7DAAAQBAJ The Plantation Machine] by Trevor Burnard, on page 37.</ref> The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the English brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica.

In 1673 one such revolt in St. Ann's Parish of 200 slaves created the separate group of Leeward Maroons. These Maroons united with a group of [[Malagasy people|Madagascars]] who had survived the shipwreck of a slave ship and formed their own maroon community in St. George's parish. Several more rebellions strengthened the numbers of this Leeward group. Notably, in 1690 a revolt at Sutton's plantation, Clarendon of 400 slaves considerably strengthened the Leeward Maroons.<ref>{{harvnb|Patterson|1970|pp=256\u2013258}}</ref> In September 1728, the British sent more troops to Jamaica, changing the balance of power with the Windward Maroons.\n\nThe Leeward Maroons inhabited \"cockpits,\" caves, or deep ravines that were easily defended, even against troops with superior firepower. Such guerrilla warfare and the use of scouts who blew the abeng (the cow horn, which was used as a trumpet) to warn of approaching British soldiers allowed the Maroons to evade, thwart, frustrate, and defeat the forces of an Empire. In 1739\u201340, the British government in Jamaica recognised that it could not defeat the Maroons, so they came to an agreement with them instead. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns, [[Accompong]]; [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]]; [[Nanny Town]], later known as [[Moore Town]], [[Scott's Hall (Jamaica)]], and [[Charles Town, Jamaica]], living under their own rulers and a British supervisor known as a superintendent.<ref>Carey, Bev (1997), ''The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880''. Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 315-355</ref>\n\nIn exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements. Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 126-163</ref>\n\nIn 1739, the British, led by Governor [[Edward Trelawny (governor)|Edward Trelawny]], sued for peace with the Leeward Maroon leader, [[Cudjoe]], described by British planters as a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. Some writers maintain that during the conflict, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned, and quarreled with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was a peace treaty with the enemy which recognized the independence of the Leeward Maroons.<ref>Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 88-126.</ref> A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of the Blue Mountains also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.<ref>Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 88-126.</ref> Following the peace treaties of 1739-1740, virgin land was opened up to settlement, and Jamaica's economy flourished in the period of peace that followed.<ref>Michael Siva, ''After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842'', PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 77-9. http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=BLL01019153409&indx=1&recIds=BLL01019153409&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&frbg=&&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl(2084770704UI0)=any&tb=t&vid=BLVU1&mode=Basic&srt=rank&tab=local_tab&dum=true&vl(freeText0)=michael%20sivapragasam&dstmp=1546605833202</ref><ref>Audra Diptee, ''From Africa to Jamaica: The Making of An Atlantic Slave Society, 1775-1807'' (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2010), p. 10.</ref><ref>Vincent Brown, ''The Reaper\u2019s Garden: Death and Power in the World of Atlantic Slavery'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2008), p. 15.</ref>\n\n===Runaway slaves and Tacky's revolt===\n{{Main|Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica)|Tacky's revolt}}\n\nIn the 1750s, a runaway slave named Ancoma formed a community made up of escaped slaves in what is now known as [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica]]. In 1759, Ancoma was eventually killed by a Maroon woman and another woman, both his captives. However, his community continued to thrive, and probably formed the basis of the community of Jack Mansong later that century.<ref>Michael Siva, ''After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842'', PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 109-110.</ref> Jack Mansong, also known as [[Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica)]], was an escaped slave who formed a community of runaways in eastern Jamaica in the 1770s and 1780s. The runaway community thrived in the same parish of St-Thomas-in-the-East, where they often attacked sugar plantations and enabled other slaves to escape. They also attack white travels on the roads. In 1781, Jack was killed by a party of Maroons.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 113-4. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf</ref> However, Jack's runaway community continued to thrive under his deputies. In 1792, Dagger was captured by the Jamaican militia, but Toney then took over as leader of the community of runaway slaves in St Thomas, and they were never apprehended or dispersed.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 116-7.</ref>\n\nThe colony's slaves, who outnumbered their white masters by a ratio of 20:1 in 1800, mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies (the majority of which were organised by [[Coromantins]]), and uprisings during the 18th century, including [[Tacky's revolt]] in May 1760. In that revolt, Tacky, a slave overseer on the Frontier plantation in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]], led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at [[Fort Haldane]], where the munitions to defend the town of [[Port Maria]] were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with [[lead shot|shot]], before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/articles_culture/tackys_rebellion.shtml |title=Jamaican Culture |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nBy dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/> [[Obeah]]men (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\nSoon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\nTacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, [[Davy the Maroon]]. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in [[Spanish Town]] until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\n===Second Maroon War===\n{{Main|Second Maroon War}}\n\nIn 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two [[pigs]]. When six [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners.  This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of [[Cudjoe]]'s Treaty of 1739, which ended the [[First Maroon War]].<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 209-249.</ref> The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] surrendered in December 1795 when they felt they were unable to maintain their guerrilla campaign.<ref>Campbell, ''Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 209-249.</ref>\n\nThe treaty signed in December between Major General [[George Walpole (British Army officer)|George Walpole]] and the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders established that the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796.  Suspicious of British intentions, most of the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny Town [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. After a few years the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were again deported to the new British settlement of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]].<ref>Campbell, ''Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 209-249.</ref>\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n===Minorities campaign for rights===\nIn the 18th century, a number of slaves secured their freedom through a variety of means, such as being mistresses or children of plantation whites. In 1780, one of these [[free people of color]], [[Cubah Cornwallis]], became well-known when she nursed British naval hero [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], back to health in Port Royal when he took ill.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), p. 117.</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century, the Jamaica Assembly granted Jews voting rights that had previously been denied them.<ref>http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0054.htm</ref> After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807/8, the Jamaican Assembly felt they needed the support of minority groups in order to avoid the complete emancipation of the slaves. At first, the Assembly resisted attempts from free coloureds in Jamaica to secure equal rights, and in 1823 the Assembly deported one of their leaders, [[Louis Celeste Lecesne]]. However, after they granted the Jews voting rights, they finally succumbed to demands from the free coloureds for equal rights. Campaigners such as [[Edward Jordon]], [[Robert Osborn (Jamaica)]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]] were successful in securing equal rights for [[free people of color]] at the beginning of the 1830s.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976).</ref>\n\n===Slave resistance===\nHundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by escaping and fighting alongside the Maroons of Trelawny Town. About half of these runaways surrendered with the Maroons, and many were executed or re-sold in slavery to Cuba. However, a few hundred stayed out in the forests of the Cockpit Country, and they joined other runaway communities. In 1798, a slave named [[Cuffee (Jamaica)]] ran away from a western estate, and established a runaway community which was able to resist attempts by the colonial forces and the Maroons remaining in Jamaica to subdue them.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 165-9, 172-5, 180-9.</ref> In the early nineteenth century, colonial records describe hundreds of runaway slaves escaping to \"Healthshire\" where they flourished for several years before they were captured by a party of Maroons.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 163-4, 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1812, a community of runaways started when a dozen men and some women escaped from the sugar plantations of Trelawny into the Cockpit Country, and they created a village with the curious name of [[Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come]]. By the 1820s, Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come housed between 50-60 runaways. The headmen of the community were escaped slaves named Warren and Forbes. Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also conducted a thriving trade with slaves from the north coast, who exchanged their salt provisions with the runaways for their ground provisions.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 191-2.</ref> In October 1824, the colonial militias tried to destroy this community. However, the community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come continued to thrive in the Cockpit Country until Emancipation in the 1830s.<ref>Siva, ''After The Treaties'', pp. 192-3.</ref>\n\n===The Baptist War===\n{{Main|Baptist War}}\n\nIn 1831, enslaved [[Baptist]] preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]] led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \"half the going wage rate.\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion.

This Apprenticeship was originally scheduled to run until 1840, but the numerous abuses committed by white plantation owners on their black apprentices led to the British government terminating it two years ahead of schedule, and the ex-slaves were finally awarded full freedom. The planters often found themselves in conflict with [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]], the mixed-race Head of the Department of the Stipendiary Magistrates, over their mistreatment of the apprentices.<ref>Black ''History of Jamaica'', pp. 159-167.</ref><ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156.</ref>\n\nEarly historians believed that with the [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1808 and [[slavery]] itself in 1834, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. However, [[Eric Williams]] presented evidence to show that the British only abolished first the slave trade and then slavery itself when they were no longer economically viable institutions.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945).</ref> \n\nThe period after [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] in 1834 initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the [[Colonial Office]] over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a majority of blacks and [[Mixed race people|people of mixed race]] (browns or [[mulatto]]s) to vote. But neither change in the political system, nor abolition of slavery changed the planter's chief interest, which lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the [[Elitism|elitist]] assembly.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 183-4.</ref> Nevertheless, at the end of the eighteenth century and in the early years of the nineteenth century, the Crown began to allow some Jamaicans\u2014mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans\u2014into the appointed councils. Two [[free people of colour]], [[Edward Jordon]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]], became leading figures in post-emancipation Jamaica. In 1835, Hill was appointed Head of the Department of Stipendiary Magistrates, a position he held for many years.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156.</ref> In 1835, Jordon was elected a member of the Assembly for Kingston, and he led the Kings House Party, or Coloured Party, that opposed the Planters Party. In 1852, Jordon became mayor Kingston, a post he held for 14 years, and he was speaker for the Assembly in the early 1860s.<ref> https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward</ref>\n\n===Morant Bay Rebellion===\n{{Main|Morant Bay Rebellion}}\n\nTensions resulted in the October 1865 [[Morant Bay rebellion]] led by [[Paul Bogle]]. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned [[plantation]]. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.<ref>Holt (1992), p. 295.</ref> The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle.\n\nA few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating.\n\nGovernor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] sent government troops, under Brigadier-General [[Alexander Nelson (British Army officer)|Alexander Nelson]],<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19875 \"Alexander Nelson\"] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \"we slaughtered all before us\u2026 man or woman or child\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\"<ref name=\"IPN\">\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\", ''The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record'' (London), 23 February 1867: 1.</ref> Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason.\n\n[[George William Gordon]], a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] and his policies, was later arrested by Governor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under [[martial law]]. The execution and trial of Gordon via [[martial law]] raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license.<ref>{{cite book|last=Semmel|first=Bernard|title=The Governor Eyre Controversy|year=1962|publisher=MacGibbon & Kee|location=London|pages=128}}</ref>  The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\"\n\n===Decline of the sugar industry===\nDuring most of the eighteenth century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. Despite the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden, sugar continued to have some success over the next decade. By the 1820s, however, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. When sugar declined as a crop, the British government was persuaded to emancipate the slaves with [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945).</ref> Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[Crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the nineteenth century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\n===Jamaica as a Crown Colony===\nIn 1846 Jamaican planters, still reeling from the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|Sugar Duties Act]], eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly and successive governors stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the [[sugar trade]], when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865.<ref>Gad Heuman, ''The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994).</ref> Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the white planters that governor [[Edward John Eyre]] and the [[Colonial Office]] succeeded in persuading the two-centuries-old assembly to vote to abolish itself and ask for the establishment of direct British rule. This move ended the growing influence of the people of colour in elective politics. The practice of barring non-whites from public office was reinstated, despite opposition from leading people of colour such as Jordon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward</ref>\n\nIn 1866 the new [[Crown colony]] government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of [[English common law]] and county courts, and a [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary force]] was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were [[British people|British]], and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were [[Jamaican people|Jamaicans]]. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance \u2013 based on shared color, attitudes, and interest \u2013 between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.\n\n===Kingston, the new capital===\n{{Main|Kingston, Jamaica#History}}\n\nIn 1872, the government passed an act to transfer government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]]. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by the Nick Catania Pirate Fleet's fire in 1703.  Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for [[Jamaica]]. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]].\n\nIn 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1965), pp. 91-2.</ref> However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston. The [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] destroyed much of the city.  Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.<ref name=\"Wilson\">J.

Garvey also promoted the [[Back-to-Africa movement]], which called for those of [[African descent]] to return to the homelands of their ancestors.<ref name=back>{{cite web|title=Historian situates 'back-to-Africa' movements in broad context|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|work=1 March 2006|publisher=Stanford.edu|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> Garvey, to no avail, pleaded with the colonial government to improve living conditions for indigenous peoples in the West Indies. <ref>{{cite web|title=Marcus Garvey|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/garvey_marcus.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nGarvey, a controversial figure, had been the target of a four-year investigation by the [[United States government]]. He was convicted of [[mail fraud]] in 1923 and had served most of a five-year term in [[USP Atlanta|an Atlanta penitentiary]] when he was deported to Jamaica in 1927. Garvey left the colony in 1935 to live in the [[United Kingdom]], where he died heavily in debt five years later. He was proclaimed Jamaica's first national hero in the 1960s after [[Edward Seaga|Edward P.G. Seaga]], then a government minister, arranged the return of his remains to Jamaica. In 1987 Jamaica petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to pardon Garvey on the basis that the federal charges brought against him were unsubstantiated and unjust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcus Garvey 1887\u20131940|url=http://www.theunia-acl.com/index.php/marcus-garvey-1887-1940|publisher=UNIA-ACL|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Rastafari movement===\n{{Main|Rastafari movement}}\n\nThe [[Rastafari movement]], an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]], was developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of [[Haile Selassie I]] as Emperor of Ethiopia. Haile Selassie I was crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia in November 1930, a significant event in that Ethiopia was the only African country other than Liberia to be independent from colonialism and Haile Selassie was the only African leader accepted among the kings and queens of Europe. Over the next two years, three Jamaicans who all happened to be overseas at the time of the coronation each returned home and independently began, as street preachers, to proclaim the divinity of the newly crowned Emperor as the returned Christ.<ref name=Barrett81>Leonard E. Barrett, ''The Rastafarians'', pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nFirst, in December 1930, [[Archibald Dunkley]], formerly a seaman, landed at [[Port Antonio]] and soon began his ministry; in 1933, he relocated to Kingston where the ''King of Kings Ethiopian Mission'' was founded. [[Joseph Hibbert]] returned from [[Costa Rica]] in 1931 and started spreading his own conviction of the Emperor's divinity in Benoah district, [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish]], through his own ministry, called ''Ethiopian Coptic Faith''; he too moved to Kingston the next year, to find [[Leonard Howell]] already teaching many of these same doctrines, having returned to Jamaica around the same time. With the addition of [[Robert Hinds]], himself a Garveyite and former Bedwardite, these four preachers soon began to attract a following among Jamaica's poor.\n\n===The Great Depression and worker protests===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\n===New labour unions and political parties===\nThe rise of [[nationalism]], as distinct from island identification or desire for [[self-determination]], is generally dated to the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|1938 labour riots]] that took place in Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. [[William Alexander Bustamante]], a moneylender in the capital city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality. He was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class. In that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement.\n\nA distant cousin of Bustamante, [[Norman Manley|Norman W. Manley]], concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over [[Power (social and political)|state power]] and [[political rights]] for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the [[People's National Party]] (PNP). It began as a nationalist movement supported by the [[mixed-race]] middle class and the liberal sector of the business community; its leaders were highly educated members of the [[upper middle class]]. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to [[Trade union|unionise labour]], although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.\n\nIn 1940 the PNP adopted a [[socialist]] ideology and later it joined the [[Socialist International]], allying formally with the [[social democratic]] parties of [[Western Europe]]. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to [[British Labour Party]] ideas on state control of the factors of production, [[equality of opportunity]], and a [[welfare state]]. The left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox [[Marxist]] views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment.\n\nBustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members. They encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life.\n\nFor the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \"barefoot man\"; the latter, \"democratic socialism,\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a [[Classless society|classless]] system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a [[high school diploma]], was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, [[University of Oxford|Oxford-trained]] lawyer, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the Crown colony's quest for independence.\n\nFollowing the 1938 disturbances in the [[West Indies]], [[London]] sent the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]] to study conditions in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean territories]]. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. Issued on 20 November 1944, the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]] modified the Crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model of government]] and [[universal adult suffrage]]. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law.\n\nThirty-one percent of the population participated in the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 elections]]. The Jamaica Labour Party \u2013 helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform \u2013 won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives. The PNP won 5 seats and 5 were gained by other, short-lived parties. In 1945 Bustamante took office as Jamaica's first premier (the pre-independence title for [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|head of government]]).\n\nUnder the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the Crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials.<ref name=jlp>{{cite web|title=The Jamaican Labour Party (JLP)|url=http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php|work=2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163859/http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Constit>{{cite web|title=History this week:Constitutional Developments in British Guiana and Jamaica between 1890 and 1945 (Part 3)|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/features/05/13/history-this-weekconstitutional-developments-in-british-guiana-and-jamaica-between-1890-and-1945-part-3/|work=13 May 2010|publisher=StabroekNews|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== West Indies Federation and road to independence ===\n{{See also|West Indies Federation|Independence of Jamaica}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the British government decided to merge [[British West Indies|its Caribbean colonies]], the [[West Indies Federation]] consisting of Jamaica and nine other colonies was formed in 1958. However, nationalism was at a rise and dissatisfaction with the new union was great. In the [[1961 Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum|1961 Federation membership referendum]] Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. Other members began withdrawing soon after. This resulted in the [[independence of Jamaica]] in 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade.\n\n==Economy==\nThe first [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], were primarily interested in extracting [[precious metal]]s and did not develop or otherwise transform Jamaica. In 1655 the English occupied the island and began a slow process of creating an [[agricultural economy]] based on slave labour in support of England's [[industrial revolution]]. During the seventeenth century, the basic patterns and social system of the [[Plantation economy|sugar plantation economy]] were established in Jamaica. Large estates owned by absentee planters were managed by local agents. The slave population increased rapidly during the last quarter of the seventeenth century and, by the end of the century, slaves outnumbered white Europeans by at least five to one. Because conditions were extremely harsh under the slave regime and the mortality rate for slaves was high, the slave population expanded through the slave trade from [[West Africa]] rather than by natural increase.\n\nDuring most of the eighteenth century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. \n\nEarlier historians believed that a major reason for the decline of sugar was the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden. However, [[Seymour Drescher]] presented evidence to show that the Jamaican sugar economy flourished before and after the abolition of the slave trade.<ref>Seymour Drescher, ''Econocide'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010).</ref> The abolition of the slave trade was followed by [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years. [[Eric Williams]] presented evidence to show that the sugar economy went into decline in the 1820s, and it was only then that the British anti-slavery movement gathered pace.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[Crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the nineteenth century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\nThe expanding relationship that Jamaica entered into with the [[United States]] during [[World War II]] produced a momentum for change that could not be turned back by the end of the war. Familiarity with the early economic progress achieved in [[Puerto Rico]] under [[Operation Bootstrap]], renewed [[immigration to the United States]], the lasting impressions of [[Marcus Garvey]], and the publication of the Moyne Commission Report led to important modifications in the Jamaican political process and demands for economic development. As was the case throughout the Commonwealth Caribbean in the mid- to late 1930s, social upheaval in Jamaica paved the way for the emergence of strong [[trade union]]s and nascent [[Politics of Jamaica|political parties]]. These changes set the stage for early modernisation in the 1940s and 1950s and for limited self-rule, introduced in 1944.\n\nAn extensive period of postwar growth transformed Jamaica into an increasingly [[industrial society]]. This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970. Manufacturing expanded from 11.3 percent in 1950 to 12.8 in 1960 and 15.7 in 1970.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Invasion of Jamaica (1655)]]\n*[[Jamaica]]\n*[[History of Jamaica]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n*[http://worldstatesmen.org/Belize.html \"Belize\".] World Statesmen.org.

Jamaica became a [[Crown colony]] in 1866.\n\n== 17th century ==\n\n===English conquest===\n{{Main|Invasion of Jamaica}}\n\nIn late 1654, English leader [[Oliver Cromwell]] launched the ''Western Design'' armada against [[Spanish West Indies|Spain's colonies in the Caribbean]].  In April 1655, [[Robert Venables|General Robert Venables]] led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at [[Santo Domingo]], [[Hispaniola]]. However, the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, known as the [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|Siege of Santo Domingo]], and the English troops were soon decimated by disease. {{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=29}} {{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=24}}{{sfn|Coward|2002|p=134}}\n\nWeakened by fever and looking for an easy victory following their defeat at Santo Domingo, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. [[Spanish Jamaica]] had been a colony of Spain for over a hundred years. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's [[Spanish Town]] capital.  The English invasion force soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica, and in response in 1657 the English Governor of Jamaica invited [[buccaneer]]s to base themselves at [[Port Royal]] on Santiago, to help defend against Spanish attacks.  Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the [[Battle of Ocho Rios (1657)|Battle of Ocho Rios]] in 1657 and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo (1658)|Battle of Rio Nuevo]] in 1658. Governor [[Edward D'Oyley]] succeeded in persuading one of the leaders of the Spanish Maroons, [[Juan de Bolas]], to switch sides and join the English along with his Maroon warriors. In 1660, when Don Cristobal de Ysasi realised that de Bolas had joined the English, he admitted that the Spanish no longer had a chance of recapturing the island, since de Bolas and his men knew the mountainous interior better than the Spanish and the English. Ysasi gave up on his dreams, and fled to Cuba.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-20.</ref><ref>C.V. Black, ''History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), p. 54.</ref> \n\nFor England, Jamaica was to be the 'dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire,' although in fact it was a possession of little economic value then.{{sfn|Coward|2002|p=134}}\n\n===Early British colonisation===\nCromwell increased the island's white population by sending indentured servants and prisoners captured [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|in battles with]] the [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]], as well as some common criminals.<ref>Black, ''History'', p. 51.</ref> This practice was continued under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and the white population was also augmented by immigrants from the [[British America|North American mainland]] and other islands, as well as by the English [[buccaneer]]s. But [[tropical diseases]] kept the number of whites well under 10,000 until about 1740. The white population increased, through migration from Britain, to 80,000 in the 1780s.<ref>Christer Petley, ''White Fury'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 24.</ref>\n\nAlthough the slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded roughly 9,500, by the end of the seventeenth century [[Slave trade|imports]] of [[slave]]s increased the [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|black population]] to at least three times the number of whites.<ref>Orlando Patterson, ''Sociology of Slavery'' (Kingston: Sangster's, 1973), p. 95.</ref> In the eighteenth century, the population of black slaves in Jamaica increased significantly from one decade to the next, despite the fact that the slave ships coming from the west coast of [[Africa]] preferred to unload at the islands of the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but this population rose to about 75,000 in 1730, and passed the 100,000 mark in the 1740s. In 1778, the black slave population passed 200,000, and by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.<ref>Patterson, ''Sociology'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nBeginning with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchy's appointment of a civil [[Governor of Jamaica|governor]] to Jamaica in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the twentieth century. The second governor, [[Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]], brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a Crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]].<ref>Black, ''History of Jamaica'', p. 55.</ref>\n\nEngland gained formal possession of Jamaica from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1670 through the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]].<ref>Black, ''History'', p. 69.</ref> Removing the pressing need for constant defence against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to [[Plantation economy|planting]]. For years, however, the planter-dominated Jamaica House of Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and [[James II of England|James II]] and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company. The [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|last Stuart governor]], the [[Duke of Albemarle]], who was more interested in [[treasure hunting]] than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to [[London]], succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement and the revolution that brought [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to the throne in 1689 confirmed the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the Assembly.<ref>Black, ''History'', pp. 72-3.</ref> This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. This was of particular importance during the [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|Anglo-French War]] in the Caribbean from 1689 to 1713.\n\nHowever, even though the Spaniards no longer threatened Jamaica, the early English settlers had to ward off attacks from the French. In 1694, [[Jean-Baptiste du Casse]] led a force of three warships and 29 transport ships that landed at [[Port Morant]] in eastern Jamaica, where they burnt plantations, destroyed over 50 sugar-works, kidnapped hundreds of slaves, and killed and tortured many white colonists. Du Casse then sailed down the southern coast, eventually landing at Carlisle Bay, with the object of marching on to [[Spanish Town]]. However, a militia company of planters and their slaves defeated du Casse, who then destroyed Carlisle Bay, and withdrew to [[St Domingue]].<ref>Black, ''History of Jamaica'', pp. 74-5.</ref> \n\nThe sugar monoculture and slave-worked [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] society spread across Jamaica throughout the eighteenth century.\n\n===Maroons===\n{{Main|Jamaican Maroons#History}}\n\nWhen the British captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three ''Palenques'', or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of [[Juan de Serras]] allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the [[Cockpit Country]], while those under [[Juan de Bolas]] established themselves in modern-day [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica]] and served as a \"black militia\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the [[Arawak]] people. Each group of [[Jamaican Maroons]] established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainsbury|first1=W. Noel|title=America and West Indies|journal=Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies|volume=1, 5|issue=1574\u20131660, 1661\u20131668}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the seventeenth century, and in the first few decades of the eighteenth century, the Maroons took a heavy toll on the [[British Army|British troops]]. The English colonial authorities sent local militia and English army units against them, but the Maroons successfully fought a guerrilla campaign against them in the mountainous interior, and forced the British government to seek peace terms to end the expensive conflict. In the second half of the seventeenth century, de Serras fought regular campaigns against the English forces, even attacking the capital of [[Spanish Town]], and he was never defeated by the English.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-35.</ref>\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, English-speaking escaped [[Akan people|Akan]] slaves were at the forefront of the Maroon fighting against the British. [[Cudjoe]] led the Leeward Maroons in western Jamaica, while [[Quao]] and [[Queen Nanny]] were the leaders of the Windward Maroons in the Blue Mountains of eastern Jamaica. The [[First Maroon War|rebellion]] finally ended, however, with the signing of peace agreements in 1739 and 1740.<ref>Craton, Michael. ''Testing the Chains''.

Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 190-282.</ref>\n\n===Jamaica's pirate economy===\nSpanish resistance continued for some years after the English conquest, in some cases with the help of the [[Jamaican Maroons]], but Spain never succeeded in retaking the island.  The English established their main coastal town at [[Port Royal]]. \nUnder early [[Kingdom of England|English]] rule, Jamaica became a haven of [[privateer]]s, [[buccaneer]]s, and occasionally outright [[pirate]]s: [[Christopher Myngs]], [[Edward Mansvelt]], and most famously, [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>Black, ''History'', pp. 55-71.</ref>\n\nIn addition to being unable to retake their land, Spain was no longer able to provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods on a regular basis. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing desperation by colonies for manufactured goods, allowed Port Royal to flourish and by 1659, two hundred houses, shops, and warehouses surrounded the fort.  Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as \"forced trade.\" Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish while sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns.<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/> While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation.  Nuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, wrote, \"Both opponents and advocates of so-called \u2018forced trade\u2019 declared the town\u2019s fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers\u2019 needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\">Nuala Zahedieh, \"Trade, Plunder, and Economic Development in Early English Jamaica, 1655\u201389,\" ''The Economic History Review'' 39, no. 2 (1986): 205\u2013222.</ref> She added, \"A report that the 300 men who accompanied Henry Morgan to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least \u00a360 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nThe forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote \"...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.\"<ref>Michael Pawson and David Buisseret, ''Port Royal, Jamaica'' (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 2000).</ref> Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of [[sugarcane]]. Zahedieh wrote, \"The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth \u00a375,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island\u2019s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed \u00a310,000 at this time.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nHowever, many successful privateers and buccaneers became integrally involved in the growing sugar industry, and its acquisition of large number of African slaves. In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of a large slave plantation, Morgan led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of Morgan and his forces.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 23, 32-3.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Old Port Royal - Project Gutenberg eText 19396.png|An illustration of pre-1692 Port Royal\nFile:Henry Morgan in colour.jpg|Henry Morgan, governor of Jamaica\nFile:Jamaica1671ogilby.jpg|English map of Jamaica from the 1670s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaica1671ogilby.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222101724/http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaica1671ogilby.html |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nFile:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|European colonies in the Caribbean during the 18th century\n</gallery>\n\n===1692 earthquake and the collapse of Port Royal===\n{{Main|1692 Jamaica earthquake}}\n\nOn 7 June 1692, a violent [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake]] struck Port Royal.

Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] to sugar cane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. [[Sugar]] was quickly snapped up by the [[Great Britain|British]], who used it in [[cake]]s and to sweeten [[tea]]s.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, sugar replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as Jamaica's main source of income and Jamaica became the largest exporter of sugar in the British Empire.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNM7DAAAQBAJ The Plantation Machine] by Trevor Burnard, on page 37.</ref> The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the English brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica.

In 1673 one such revolt in St. Ann's Parish of 200 slaves created the separate group of Leeward Maroons. These Maroons united with a group of [[Malagasy people|Madagascars]] who had survived the shipwreck of a slave ship and formed their own maroon community in St. George's parish. Several more rebellions strengthened the numbers of this Leeward group. Notably, in 1690 a revolt at Sutton's plantation, Clarendon of 400 slaves considerably strengthened the Leeward Maroons.<ref>{{harvnb|Patterson|1970|pp=256\u2013258}}</ref> In September 1728, the British sent more troops to Jamaica, changing the balance of power with the Windward Maroons.\n\nThe Leeward Maroons inhabited \"cockpits,\" caves, or deep ravines that were easily defended, even against troops with superior firepower. Such guerrilla warfare and the use of scouts who blew the abeng (the cow horn, which was used as a trumpet) to warn of approaching British soldiers allowed the Maroons to evade, thwart, frustrate, and defeat the forces of an Empire. In 1739\u201340, the British government in Jamaica recognised that it could not defeat the Maroons, so they came to an agreement with them instead. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns, [[Accompong]]; [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]]; [[Nanny Town]], later known as [[Moore Town]], [[Scott's Hall (Jamaica)]], and [[Charles Town, Jamaica]], living under their own rulers and a British supervisor known as a superintendent.<ref>Carey, Bev (1997), ''The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880''. Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, pp. 315-355</ref>\n\nIn exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements. Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 126-163</ref>\n\nIn 1739, the British, led by Governor [[Edward Trelawny (governor)|Edward Trelawny]], sued for peace with the Leeward Maroon leader, [[Cudjoe]], described by British planters as a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. Some writers maintain that during the conflict, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned, and quarreled with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was a peace treaty with the enemy which recognized the independence of the Leeward Maroons.<ref>Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 88-126.</ref> A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of the Blue Mountains also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.<ref>Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 88-126.</ref> Following the peace treaties of 1739-1740, virgin land was opened up to settlement, and Jamaica's economy flourished in the period of peace that followed.<ref>Michael Siva, ''After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842'', PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 77-9. http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=BLL01019153409&indx=1&recIds=BLL01019153409&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&frbg=&&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl(2084770704UI0)=any&tb=t&vid=BLVU1&mode=Basic&srt=rank&tab=local_tab&dum=true&vl(freeText0)=michael%20sivapragasam&dstmp=1546605833202</ref><ref>Audra Diptee, ''From Africa to Jamaica: The Making of An Atlantic Slave Society, 1775-1807'' (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2010), p. 10.</ref><ref>Vincent Brown, ''The Reaper\u2019s Garden: Death and Power in the World of Atlantic Slavery'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2008), p. 15.</ref>\n\n===Runaway slaves and Tacky's revolt===\n{{Main|Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica)|Tacky's revolt}}\n\nIn the 1750s, a runaway slave named Ancoma formed a community made up of escaped slaves in what is now known as [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica]]. In 1759, Ancoma was eventually killed by a Maroon woman and another woman, both his captives. However, his community continued to thrive, and probably formed the basis of the community of Jack Mansong later that century.<ref>Michael Siva, ''After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842'', PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 109-110.</ref> Jack Mansong, also known as [[Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica)]], was an escaped slave who formed a community of runaways in eastern Jamaica in the 1770s and 1780s. The runaway community thrived in the same parish of St-Thomas-in-the-East, where they often attacked sugar plantations and enabled other slaves to escape. They also attack white travels on the roads. In 1781, Jack was killed by a party of Maroons.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 113-4. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf</ref> However, Jack's runaway community continued to thrive under his deputies. In 1792, Dagger was captured by the Jamaican militia, but Toney then took over as leader of the community of runaway slaves in St Thomas, and they were never apprehended or dispersed.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 116-7.</ref>\n\nThe colony's slaves, who outnumbered their white masters by a ratio of 20:1 in 1800, mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies (the majority of which were organised by [[Coromantins]]), and uprisings during the 18th century, including [[Tacky's revolt]] in May 1760. In that revolt, Tacky, a slave overseer on the Frontier plantation in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]], led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at [[Fort Haldane]], where the munitions to defend the town of [[Port Maria]] were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with [[lead shot|shot]], before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/articles_culture/tackys_rebellion.shtml |title=Jamaican Culture |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nBy dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/> [[Obeah]]men (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\nSoon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\nTacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, [[Davy the Maroon]]. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in [[Spanish Town]] until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\n===Second Maroon War===\n{{Main|Second Maroon War}}\n\nIn 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two [[pigs]]. When six [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners.  This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of [[Cudjoe]]'s Treaty of 1739, which ended the [[First Maroon War]].<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 209-249.</ref> The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] surrendered in December 1795 when they felt they were unable to maintain their guerrilla campaign.<ref>Campbell, ''Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 209-249.</ref>\n\nThe treaty signed in December between Major General [[George Walpole (British Army officer)|George Walpole]] and the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] leaders established that the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796.  Suspicious of British intentions, most of the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny Town [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. After a few years the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] were again deported to the new British settlement of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]].<ref>Campbell, ''Maroons of Jamaica'', pp. 209-249.</ref>\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n===Minorities campaign for rights===\nIn the 18th century, a number of slaves secured their freedom through a variety of means, such as being mistresses or children of plantation whites. In 1780, one of these [[free people of color]], [[Cubah Cornwallis]], became well-known when she nursed British naval hero [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], back to health in Port Royal when he took ill.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), p. 117.</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century, the Jamaica Assembly granted Jews voting rights that had previously been denied them.<ref>http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0054.htm</ref> After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807/8, the Jamaican Assembly felt they needed the support of minority groups in order to avoid the complete emancipation of the slaves. At first, the Assembly resisted attempts from free coloureds in Jamaica to secure equal rights, and in 1823 the Assembly deported one of their leaders, [[Louis Celeste Lecesne]]. However, after they granted the Jews voting rights, they finally succumbed to demands from the free coloureds for equal rights. Campaigners such as [[Edward Jordon]], [[Robert Osborn (Jamaica)]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]] were successful in securing equal rights for [[free people of color]] at the beginning of the 1830s.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976).</ref>\n\n===Slave resistance===\nHundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by escaping and fighting alongside the Maroons of Trelawny Town. About half of these runaways surrendered with the Maroons, and many were executed or re-sold in slavery to Cuba. However, a few hundred stayed out in the forests of the Cockpit Country, and they joined other runaway communities. In 1798, a slave named [[Cuffee (Jamaica)]] ran away from a western estate, and established a runaway community which was able to resist attempts by the colonial forces and the Maroons remaining in Jamaica to subdue them.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 165-9, 172-5, 180-9.</ref> In the early nineteenth century, colonial records describe hundreds of runaway slaves escaping to \"Healthshire\" where they flourished for several years before they were captured by a party of Maroons.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 163-4, 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1812, a community of runaways started when a dozen men and some women escaped from the sugar plantations of Trelawny into the Cockpit Country, and they created a village with the curious name of [[Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come]]. By the 1820s, Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come housed between 50-60 runaways. The headmen of the community were escaped slaves named Warren and Forbes. Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also conducted a thriving trade with slaves from the north coast, who exchanged their salt provisions with the runaways for their ground provisions.<ref>Siva, ''After the Treaties'', pp. 191-2.</ref> In October 1824, the colonial militias tried to destroy this community. However, the community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come continued to thrive in the Cockpit Country until Emancipation in the 1830s.<ref>Siva, ''After The Treaties'', pp. 192-3.</ref>\n\n===The Baptist War===\n{{Main|Baptist War}}\n\nIn 1831, enslaved [[Baptist]] preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]] led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \"half the going wage rate.\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion.

Approximately five hundred slaves were killed in total: 207 during the revolt and somewhere in the range between 310 and 340 slaves were killed through \"various forms of judicial executions\" after the rebellion was concluded, at times, for quite minor offences (one recorded execution indicates the crime being the theft of a pig; another, a cow).<ref>Mary Reckord. \"The Jamaican Slave Rebellion of 1831\", ''Past & Present'' (July 1968), 40(3): pp. 122, 124\u2013125.</ref> An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how three or four simultaneous executions were commonly observed; bodies would be allowed to pile up until workhouse negroes carted the bodies away at night and bury them in mass graves outside town.<ref name=Revauger/> The brutality of the plantocracy during the revolt is thought to have accelerated the process of emancipation, with initial measures beginning in 1833.\n\n===Emancipation===\nBecause of the loss of property and life in the 1831 Baptist War rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries.  Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of 1 August 1834, throughout the [[British Empire]].<ref>Craton, ''Testing the Chains'', pp. 319-323.</ref> The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners' service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the [[Apprenticeship]] System. This Apprenticeship was originally scheduled to run until 1840, but the numerous abuses committed by white plantation owners on their black apprentices led to the British government terminating it two years ahead of schedule, and the ex-slaves were finally awarded full freedom. The planters often found themselves in conflict with [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]], the mixed-race Head of the Department of the Stipendiary Magistrates, over their mistreatment of the apprentices.<ref>Black ''History of Jamaica'', pp. 159-167.</ref><ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156.</ref>\n\nEarly historians believed that with the [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1808 and [[slavery]] itself in 1834, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. However, [[Eric Williams]] presented evidence to show that the British only abolished first the slave trade and then slavery itself when they were no longer economically viable institutions.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945).</ref> \n\nThe period after [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] in 1834 initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the [[Colonial Office]] over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a majority of blacks and [[Mixed race people|people of mixed race]] (browns or [[mulatto]]s) to vote. But neither change in the political system, nor abolition of slavery changed the planter's chief interest, which lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the [[Elitism|elitist]] assembly.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 183-4.</ref> Nevertheless, at the end of the eighteenth century and in the early years of the nineteenth century, the Crown began to allow some Jamaicans\u2014mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans\u2014into the appointed councils. Two [[free people of colour]], [[Edward Jordon]] and [[Richard Hill (Jamaica)]], became leading figures in post-emancipation Jamaica. In 1835, Hill was appointed Head of the Department of Stipendiary Magistrates, a position he held for many years.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Dynamics of Change in a Slave Society'' (London: AUP, 1976), p. 156.</ref> In 1835, Jordon was elected a member of the Assembly for Kingston, and he led the Kings House Party, or Coloured Party, that opposed the Planters Party. In 1852, Jordon became mayor Kingston, a post he held for 14 years, and he was speaker for the Assembly in the early 1860s.<ref> https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward</ref>\n\n===Morant Bay Rebellion===\n{{Main|Morant Bay Rebellion}}\n\nTensions resulted in the October 1865 [[Morant Bay rebellion]] led by [[Paul Bogle]]. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned [[plantation]]. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.<ref>Holt (1992), p. 295.</ref> The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle.\n\nA few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating.\n\nGovernor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] sent government troops, under Brigadier-General [[Alexander Nelson (British Army officer)|Alexander Nelson]],<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19875 \"Alexander Nelson\"] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \"we slaughtered all before us\u2026 man or woman or child\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\"<ref name=\"IPN\">\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\", ''The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record'' (London), 23 February 1867: 1.</ref> Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason.\n\n[[George William Gordon]], a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] and his policies, was later arrested by Governor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under [[martial law]]. The execution and trial of Gordon via [[martial law]] raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license.<ref>{{cite book|last=Semmel|first=Bernard|title=The Governor Eyre Controversy|year=1962|publisher=MacGibbon & Kee|location=London|pages=128}}</ref>  The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\"\n\n===Decline of the sugar industry===\nDuring most of the eighteenth century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. Despite the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden, sugar continued to have some success over the next decade. By the 1820s, however, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. When sugar declined as a crop, the British government was persuaded to emancipate the slaves with [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1945).</ref> Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[Crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the nineteenth century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\n===Jamaica as a Crown Colony===\nIn 1846 Jamaican planters, still reeling from the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|Sugar Duties Act]], eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly and successive governors stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the [[sugar trade]], when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865.<ref>Gad Heuman, ''The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994).</ref> Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the white planters that governor [[Edward John Eyre]] and the [[Colonial Office]] succeeded in persuading the two-centuries-old assembly to vote to abolish itself and ask for the establishment of direct British rule. This move ended the growing influence of the people of colour in elective politics. The practice of barring non-whites from public office was reinstated, despite opposition from leading people of colour such as Jordon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jordon-edward</ref>\n\nIn 1866 the new [[Crown colony]] government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of [[English common law]] and county courts, and a [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary force]] was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were [[British people|British]], and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were [[Jamaican people|Jamaicans]]. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance \u2013 based on shared color, attitudes, and interest \u2013 between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.\n\n===Kingston, the new capital===\n{{Main|Kingston, Jamaica#History}}\n\nIn 1872, the government passed an act to transfer government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]]. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by the Nick Catania Pirate Fleet's fire in 1703.  Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for [[Jamaica]]. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]].\n\nIn 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act.<ref>C.V. Black, ''A History of Jamaica'' (London: Collins, 1965), pp. 91-2.</ref> However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston. The [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] destroyed much of the city.  Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.<ref name=\"Wilson\">J.

Garvey also promoted the [[Back-to-Africa movement]], which called for those of [[African descent]] to return to the homelands of their ancestors.<ref name=back>{{cite web|title=Historian situates 'back-to-Africa' movements in broad context|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|work=1 March 2006|publisher=Stanford.edu|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> Garvey, to no avail, pleaded with the colonial government to improve living conditions for indigenous peoples in the West Indies. <ref>{{cite web|title=Marcus Garvey|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/garvey_marcus.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nGarvey, a controversial figure, had been the target of a four-year investigation by the [[United States government]]. He was convicted of [[mail fraud]] in 1923 and had served most of a five-year term in [[USP Atlanta|an Atlanta penitentiary]] when he was deported to Jamaica in 1927. Garvey left the colony in 1935 to live in the [[United Kingdom]], where he died heavily in debt five years later. He was proclaimed Jamaica's first national hero in the 1960s after [[Edward Seaga|Edward P.G. Seaga]], then a government minister, arranged the return of his remains to Jamaica. In 1987 Jamaica petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to pardon Garvey on the basis that the federal charges brought against him were unsubstantiated and unjust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcus Garvey 1887\u20131940|url=http://www.theunia-acl.com/index.php/marcus-garvey-1887-1940|publisher=UNIA-ACL|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Rastafari movement===\n{{Main|Rastafari movement}}\n\nThe [[Rastafari movement]], an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]], was developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of [[Haile Selassie I]] as Emperor of Ethiopia. Haile Selassie I was crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia in November 1930, a significant event in that Ethiopia was the only African country other than Liberia to be independent from colonialism and Haile Selassie was the only African leader accepted among the kings and queens of Europe. Over the next two years, three Jamaicans who all happened to be overseas at the time of the coronation each returned home and independently began, as street preachers, to proclaim the divinity of the newly crowned Emperor as the returned Christ.<ref name=Barrett81>Leonard E. Barrett, ''The Rastafarians'', pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nFirst, in December 1930, [[Archibald Dunkley]], formerly a seaman, landed at [[Port Antonio]] and soon began his ministry; in 1933, he relocated to Kingston where the ''King of Kings Ethiopian Mission'' was founded. [[Joseph Hibbert]] returned from [[Costa Rica]] in 1931 and started spreading his own conviction of the Emperor's divinity in Benoah district, [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish]], through his own ministry, called ''Ethiopian Coptic Faith''; he too moved to Kingston the next year, to find [[Leonard Howell]] already teaching many of these same doctrines, having returned to Jamaica around the same time. With the addition of [[Robert Hinds]], himself a Garveyite and former Bedwardite, these four preachers soon began to attract a following among Jamaica's poor.\n\n===The Great Depression and worker protests===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\n===New labour unions and political parties===\nThe rise of [[nationalism]], as distinct from island identification or desire for [[self-determination]], is generally dated to the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|1938 labour riots]] that took place in Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. [[William Alexander Bustamante]], a moneylender in the capital city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality. He was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class. In that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement.\n\nA distant cousin of Bustamante, [[Norman Manley|Norman W. Manley]], concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over [[Power (social and political)|state power]] and [[political rights]] for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the [[People's National Party]] (PNP). It began as a nationalist movement supported by the [[mixed-race]] middle class and the liberal sector of the business community; its leaders were highly educated members of the [[upper middle class]]. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to [[Trade union|unionise labour]], although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.\n\nIn 1940 the PNP adopted a [[socialist]] ideology and later it joined the [[Socialist International]], allying formally with the [[social democratic]] parties of [[Western Europe]]. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to [[British Labour Party]] ideas on state control of the factors of production, [[equality of opportunity]], and a [[welfare state]]. The left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox [[Marxist]] views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment.\n\nBustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members. They encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life.\n\nFor the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \"barefoot man\"; the latter, \"democratic socialism,\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a [[Classless society|classless]] system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a [[high school diploma]], was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, [[University of Oxford|Oxford-trained]] lawyer, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the Crown colony's quest for independence.\n\nFollowing the 1938 disturbances in the [[West Indies]], [[London]] sent the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]] to study conditions in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean territories]]. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. Issued on 20 November 1944, the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]] modified the Crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model of government]] and [[universal adult suffrage]]. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law.\n\nThirty-one percent of the population participated in the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 elections]]. The Jamaica Labour Party \u2013 helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform \u2013 won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives. The PNP won 5 seats and 5 were gained by other, short-lived parties. In 1945 Bustamante took office as Jamaica's first premier (the pre-independence title for [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|head of government]]).\n\nUnder the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the Crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials.<ref name=jlp>{{cite web|title=The Jamaican Labour Party (JLP)|url=http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php|work=2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163859/http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Constit>{{cite web|title=History this week:Constitutional Developments in British Guiana and Jamaica between 1890 and 1945 (Part 3)|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/features/05/13/history-this-weekconstitutional-developments-in-british-guiana-and-jamaica-between-1890-and-1945-part-3/|work=13 May 2010|publisher=StabroekNews|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== West Indies Federation and road to independence ===\n{{See also|West Indies Federation|Independence of Jamaica}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the British government decided to merge [[British West Indies|its Caribbean colonies]], the [[West Indies Federation]] consisting of Jamaica and nine other colonies was formed in 1958. However, nationalism was at a rise and dissatisfaction with the new union was great. In the [[1961 Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum|1961 Federation membership referendum]] Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. Other members began withdrawing soon after. This resulted in the [[independence of Jamaica]] in 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade.\n\n==Economy==\nThe first [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], were primarily interested in extracting [[precious metal]]s and did not develop or otherwise transform Jamaica. In 1655 the English occupied the island and began a slow process of creating an [[agricultural economy]] based on slave labour in support of England's [[industrial revolution]]. During the seventeenth century, the basic patterns and social system of the [[Plantation economy|sugar plantation economy]] were established in Jamaica. Large estates owned by absentee planters were managed by local agents. The slave population increased rapidly during the last quarter of the seventeenth century and, by the end of the century, slaves outnumbered white Europeans by at least five to one. Because conditions were extremely harsh under the slave regime and the mortality rate for slaves was high, the slave population expanded through the slave trade from [[West Africa]] rather than by natural increase.\n\nDuring most of the eighteenth century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugar production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. \n\nEarlier historians believed that a major reason for the decline of sugar was the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden. However, [[Seymour Drescher]] presented evidence to show that the Jamaican sugar economy flourished before and after the abolition of the slave trade.<ref>Seymour Drescher, ''Econocide'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010).</ref> The abolition of the slave trade was followed by [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years. [[Eric Williams]] presented evidence to show that the sugar economy went into decline in the 1820s, and it was only then that the British anti-slavery movement gathered pace.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[Crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance.

The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] caused sugar prices to slump in 1929 and led to the return of many Jamaicans. Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\nThe expanding relationship that Jamaica entered into with the [[United States]] during [[World War II]] produced a momentum for change that could not be turned back by the end of the war. Familiarity with the early economic progress achieved in [[Puerto Rico]] under [[Operation Bootstrap]], renewed [[immigration to the United States]], the lasting impressions of [[Marcus Garvey]], and the publication of the Moyne Commission Report led to important modifications in the Jamaican political process and demands for economic development. As was the case throughout the Commonwealth Caribbean in the mid- to late 1930s, social upheaval in Jamaica paved the way for the emergence of strong [[trade union]]s and nascent [[Politics of Jamaica|political parties]]. These changes set the stage for early modernisation in the 1940s and 1950s and for limited self-rule, introduced in 1944.\n\nAn extensive period of postwar growth transformed Jamaica into an increasingly [[industrial society]]. This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970. Manufacturing expanded from 11.3 percent in 1950 to 12.8 in 1960 and 15.7 in 1970.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Invasion of Jamaica (1655)]]\n*[[Jamaica]]\n*[[History of Jamaica]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n*[http://worldstatesmen.org/Belize.html \"Belize\".] World Statesmen.org.

Shree also stands for Goddess of Wealth and Goddess of Knowledge.

A 2- days camp for member children is organized at State Bal Bhavans. After local selection 8 children (2 in each stream) are nominated by the affiliated Bal Bhavans for their respective Zonal level camps. An additional nomination is sent in case the nominee is a child of special needs or from tribal areas.\n\n=== Zonal Level ===\nIn the zonal level, the country has been divided into different zones \u2013 North, East, West, Central, and South. As there are large number of Bal Bhavans in the southern region, South Zone has further been divided into two zones \u2013 South-I and South-II Zones. Every year different Zonal Centers are identified for organizing zonal selection camps. As there are certain states where there are no Bal Bhavans, representation of these states are ensured through the Chief Secretaries of these states. Children selected at the local levels participate in these 3-days zonal level camps where the second round of selections is made by local experts, specialists from the Zone and National Bal Bhavan. The local resource persons are thoroughly briefed by the National Bal Bhavan before the start of the camps.\n\n=== National Level ===\nThis is the final level where the qualifying students from different States are provided a common platform to prove their creativity in their respective fields at the 4-days National Level Camp held at National Bal Bhavan. New Delhi. A panel of experts and resource persons drawn from the various streams is identified to administer the tests. In the National Level camp the psychological tests are also conducted by experts. These include verbal tests and tests on creativity. On the basis of these tests and other tools, the children are finally selected.\n\n== Criteria of Selection ==\n\nWhile selecting children, the process and product are assessed on the basis of: \n* Originality \n* Innovative approach \n* Fluency \n* Flexibility \n* Divergent thinking \n* Elaboration of ideas \n* Creative process culminating into meaningful product \n* Effective functioning in the group \n* Analytical and critical approach\n\n== Tools used for selection of children ==\nThere are two types of tools used for selection of children \n* Activity related tools \n* Psychological tests\n\n=== Activity Related Tools ===\nFor identifying the creative talents of children, an exhaustive list of activities is planned in four identified areas. The tools are specific to the activity as well as according to the different age groups.
