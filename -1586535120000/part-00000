{"title_page": "Remote Desktop Protocol", "text_new": "{{short description|Proprietary protocol that can provide a user with the graphical interface from another remote computer}}\n'''Remote Desktop Protocol''' ('''RDP''') is a [[proprietary protocol]] developed by [[Microsoft]], which provides a user with a [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface]] to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.\n\n\nClients exist for most versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] (including [[Windows Mobile]]), [[Linux]], [[Unix]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and other [[operating system]]s. RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists. By default, the server listens on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[Computer port (software)|port]] 3389<ref name=MSKBDefaultPort>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306759 |title=How to change the listening port for Remote Desktop |publisher=Microsoft |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 2, 2007}} Microsoft KB article 306759, revision 2.2.</ref> and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 3389.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&page=64 |title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry |publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority |date=January 9, 2015 |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft currently refers to their official RDP client software as [[Remote Desktop Connection]], formerly \"Terminal Services Client\".\n\nThe protocol is an extension of the [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] [[T.120|T.128]] application sharing protocol. Microsoft makes some specifications public on their website.<ref name=rdesktop>{{cite web|url=http://www.rdesktop.org/#docs|title=rdesktop: A Remote Desktop Protocol Client|author=|date=|website=www.rdesktop.org}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Remote Desktop Services}}\n\n{{bad summary}}\nEvery version of Microsoft Windows from Windows XP onward<ref>{{cite web | url= http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-vista/Connect-to-another-computer-using-Remote-Desktop-Connection | title= Connecting to another computer Remote Desktop Connection | author= Microsoft | accessdate= 2012-12-22}}</ref> includes an installed Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) (\"Terminal Services\") client (<tt>mstsc.exe</tt>) whose version is determined by that of the operating system or by the last applied Windows Service Pack. The Terminal Services server is supported as an official feature on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, [[Windows 2000 Server]], all editions of [[Windows XP]] except Windows XP Home Edition, [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Home Server]], on [[Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs]], in [[Windows Vista]] Ultimate, Enterprise and Business editions, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and on Windows 7 Professional and above.\n\nMicrosoft provides the client required for connecting to newer RDP versions for downlevel operating systems. Since the server improvements are not available downlevel, the features introduced with each newer RDP version only work on downlevel operating systems when connecting ''to'' a higher version RDP server from these older operating systems, and not when using the RDP server in the older operating system.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Version 4.0 ===\nBased on the [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] T.128 application sharing protocol (during draft also known as \"T.share\") from the [[T.120]] recommendation series, the first version of RDP (named version 4.0) was introduced by Microsoft with \"Terminal Services\", as a part of their product [[Windows NT 4.0]] Server, Terminal Server Edition. The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]'s MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of [[Citrix WinFrame]] atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0. The Citrix-provided DLLs included in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Services Edition still carry a Citrix copyright rather than a Microsoft copyright. Later versions of Windows integrated the necessary support directly. The T.128 application sharing technology was acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Limited.<ref>Implementing Collaboration Technologies in Industry, Bj\u00f8rn Erik Munkvold, 2003; Chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Version 5.0 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows 2000#Server family functionality|Windows 2000 Server]], added support for a number of features, including printing to local printers, and aimed to improve network bandwidth usage.\n\n=== Version 5.1 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows XP]] Professional and included support for 24-bit color and sound.

There are many GUI clients, like [[tsclient]] and [[KRDC]], that are built on top of rdesktop; [[CoRD]] is such a client for the Macintosh.<ref name=rdesktop/>\n\nIn 2009, rdesktop was forked as FreeRDP, a new project aiming at modularizing the code, addressing various issues, and implementing new features. FreeRDP comes with its own command-line-client xfreerdp, which supports Seamless Windows in RDP6.<ref>{{cite web |title=FreeRDP-old README |url=https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP-old |website=GitHub |language=en |date=2010 |quote=FreeRDP is a successor to rdesktop, a longtime-favored application for use on *nix systems to access Windows servers and workstations.

The Windows Remote Desktop Connection client can be used to connect to such a server.\n\nProprietary RDP client solutions such as [[rdpclient]] are available as a stand-alone application or embedded with client hardware. A new access paradigm, browser-based access, has enabled users to access Windows desktops and applications on any RDP hosts, such as Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) Session Hosts (Terminal Services) and virtual desktops, as well as remote physical PCs. \n\nThere is also a VirtualBox Remote Display Protocol (VRDP) used in the [[VirtualBox]] virtual machine implementation by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].<ref>{{cite web |title=VirtualBox Manual: 7.1. Remote Display (VRDP Support) |url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#vrde |website=VirtualBox |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> This protocol is compatible with all RDP clients, such as that provided with Windows but, unlike the original RDP, can be configured to accept unencrypted and password unprotected connections, which may be useful in secure and trusted networks, such as home or office [[LAN]]s. By default, Microsoft's RDP server refuses connections to user accounts with empty passwords (but this can be changed with the [[Group Policy]] Editor<ref>{{cite web|last=Bens |first=Jelle |url=http://jellebens.blogspot.ru/2010/01/windows-7-rdp-with-blank-password.html |title=Jelle Bens: Windows 7 RDP with blank password |publisher=Jellebens.blogspot.ru |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>). External and guest authorization options are provided by VRDP as well. It does not matter which operating system is installed as a guest because VRDP is implemented on the virtual machine (host) level, not in the guest system. The [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] VirtualBox Extension Pack is required.\n\n== Patents ==\nMicrosoft requires third-party implementations to license the relevant RDP patents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2013/12/11/remote-desktop-protocol-licensing-available-for-rdp-8/ |title=Remote Desktop Protocol Licensing Available for RDP 8 |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2018-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208211152/https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2013/12/11/remote-desktop-protocol-licensing-available-for-rdp-8/ |archive-date=2018-02-08 |url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|February 2014}}, the extent to which open-source clients meet this requirement remains unknown.\n\n== Use in cybercrime ==\nSecurity researchers have reported that cybercriminals are selling compromised RDP servers on underground forums as well as specialized illicit RDP shops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securelist.com/xdedic-the-shady-world-of-hacked-servers-for-sale/75027/|title=xDedic \u2013 the shady world of hacked servers for sale|last=GReAT|date=June 15, 2016|website=SecureList|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/uas-shop-international-rdp-servers/|title=\"Ultimate Anonymity Services\" Shop Offers Cybercriminals International RDP Servers|last1=Kremez|first1=Vitali|last2=Rowley|first2=Liv|date=2017-10-24|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> These compromised RDPs may be used as a \"staging ground\" for conducting other types of fraud or to access sensitive personal or corporate data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securityintelligence.com/news/dark-web-rdp-shops-offer-access-to-vulnerable-systems-for-as-little-as-3/|title=Dark Web 'RDP Shops' Offer Access to Vulnerable Systems for as Little as $3|last=Bisson|first=David|date=19 July 2018|website=Security Intelligence|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> Researchers further report instances of cybercriminals using RDPs to directly drop malware on computers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3291617/security/samsam-infected-thousands-of-labcorp-systems-via-brute-force-rdp.html|title=Samsam infected thousands of LabCorp systems via brute force RDP|last=Ragan|first=Steve|date=2018-07-19|website=CSO Online|language=en|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[BlueKeep (security vulnerability)]]\n* [[Comparison of remote desktop software]]\n* [[Desktop virtualization]]\n* [[SPICE (protocol)|SPICE]] and [[RFB protocol]] &ndash; other desktop remoting protocols\n* [[Virtual private server]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015.aspx Remote Desktop Protocol] \u2013 from Microsoft's Developer Network\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/186607 Understanding the Remote Desktop Protocol] \u2013 from support.microsoft.com\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240445(PROT.10).aspx MS-RDPBCGR: Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting Specification] \u2013 from Microsoft's Developer Network\n{{remote administration software}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Microsoft server technology]]\n[[Category:Remote desktop]]\n[[Category:Windows components]]\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Remote desktop protocols]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Proprietary protocol that can provide a user with the graphical interface from another remote computer}}\n'''Remote Desktop Protocol''' ('''RDP''') is a [[proprietary protocol]] developed by [[Microsoft]], which provides a user with a [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface]] to connect to another computer over a network connection.

Since the server improvements are not available downlevel, the features introduced with each newer RDP version only work on downlevel operating systems when connecting ''to'' a higher version RDP server from these older operating systems, and not when using the RDP server in the older operating system.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Version 4.0 ===\nBased on the [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] T.128 application sharing protocol (during draft also known as \"T.share\") from the [[T.120]] recommendation series, the first version of RDP (named version 4.0) was introduced by Microsoft with \"Terminal Services\", as a part of their product [[Windows NT 4.0]] Server, Terminal Server Edition. The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]'s MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of [[Citrix WinFrame]] atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0. The Citrix-provided DLLs included in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Services Edition still carry a Citrix copyright rather than a Microsoft copyright. Later versions of Windows integrated the necessary support directly. The T.128 application sharing technology was acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Limited.<ref>Implementing Collaboration Technologies in Industry, Bj\u00f8rn Erik Munkvold, 2003; Chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Version 5.0 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows 2000#Server family functionality|Windows 2000 Server]], added support for a number of features, including printing to local printers, and aimed to improve network bandwidth usage.\n\n=== Version 5.1 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows XP]] Professional and included support for 24-bit color and sound.

For instance, the open-source command-line client [[rdesktop]] is available for Linux/Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems. There are many GUI clients, like [[tsclient]] and [[KRDC]], that are built on top of rdesktop; [[CoRD]] is such a client for the Macintosh.<ref name=rdesktop/>\n\nIn 2009, rdesktop was forked as FreeRDP, a new project aiming at modularizing the code, addressing various issues, and implementing new features. FreeRDP comes with its own command-line-client xfreerdp, which supports Seamless Windows in RDP6.<ref>{{cite web |title=FreeRDP-old README |url=https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP-old |website=GitHub |language=en |date=2010 |quote=FreeRDP is a successor to rdesktop, a longtime-favored application for use on *nix systems to access Windows servers and workstations.

The Windows Remote Desktop Connection client can be used to connect to such a server.\n\nProprietary RDP client solutions such as [[rdpclient]] are available as a stand-alone application or embedded with client hardware. A new access paradigm, browser-based access, has enabled users to access Windows desktops and applications on any RDP hosts, such as Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) Session Hosts (Terminal Services) and virtual desktops, as well as remote physical PCs. \n\nThere is also a VirtualBox Remote Display Protocol (VRDP) used in the [[VirtualBox]] virtual machine implementation by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].<ref>{{cite web |title=VirtualBox Manual: 7.1. Remote Display (VRDP Support) |url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#vrde |website=VirtualBox |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> This protocol is compatible with all RDP clients, such as that provided with Windows but, unlike the original RDP, can be configured to accept unencrypted and password unprotected connections, which may be useful in secure and trusted networks, such as home or office [[LAN]]s. By default, Microsoft's RDP server refuses connections to user accounts with empty passwords (but this can be changed with the [[Group Policy]] Editor<ref>{{cite web|last=Bens |first=Jelle |url=http://jellebens.blogspot.ru/2010/01/windows-7-rdp-with-blank-password.html |title=Jelle Bens: Windows 7 RDP with blank password |publisher=Jellebens.blogspot.ru |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>). External and guest authorization options are provided by VRDP as well. It does not matter which operating system is installed as a guest because VRDP is implemented on the virtual machine (host) level, not in the guest system. The [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] VirtualBox Extension Pack is required.\n\n== Patents ==\nMicrosoft requires third-party implementations to license the relevant RDP patents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2013/12/11/remote-desktop-protocol-licensing-available-for-rdp-8/ |title=Remote Desktop Protocol Licensing Available for RDP 8 |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2018-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208211152/https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2013/12/11/remote-desktop-protocol-licensing-available-for-rdp-8/ |archive-date=2018-02-08 |url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|February 2014}}, the extent to which open-source clients meet this requirement remains unknown.\n\n== Use in cybercrime ==\nSecurity researchers have reported that cybercriminals are selling compromised RDP servers on underground forums as well as specialized illicit RDP shops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securelist.com/xdedic-the-shady-world-of-hacked-servers-for-sale/75027/|title=xDedic \u2013 the shady world of hacked servers for sale|last=GReAT|date=June 15, 2016|website=SecureList|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/uas-shop-international-rdp-servers/|title=\"Ultimate Anonymity Services\" Shop Offers Cybercriminals International RDP Servers|last1=Kremez|first1=Vitali|last2=Rowley|first2=Liv|date=2017-10-24|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> These compromised RDPs may be used as a \"staging ground\" for conducting other types of fraud or to access sensitive personal or corporate data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://securityintelligence.com/news/dark-web-rdp-shops-offer-access-to-vulnerable-systems-for-as-little-as-3/|title=Dark Web 'RDP Shops' Offer Access to Vulnerable Systems for as Little as $3|last=Bisson|first=David|date=19 July 2018|website=Security Intelligence|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> Researchers further report instances of cybercriminals using RDPs to directly drop malware on computers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3291617/security/samsam-infected-thousands-of-labcorp-systems-via-brute-force-rdp.html|title=Samsam infected thousands of LabCorp systems via brute force RDP|last=Ragan|first=Steve|date=2018-07-19|website=CSO Online|language=en|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[BlueKeep (security vulnerability)]]\n* [[Comparison of remote desktop software]]\n* [[Desktop virtualization]]\n* [[SPICE (protocol)|SPICE]] and [[RFB protocol]] &ndash; other desktop remoting protocols\n* [[Virtual private server]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015.aspx Remote Desktop Protocol] \u2013 from Microsoft's Developer Network\n* [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/186607 Understanding the Remote Desktop Protocol] \u2013 from support.microsoft.com\n* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240445(PROT.10).aspx MS-RDPBCGR: Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting Specification] \u2013 from Microsoft's Developer Network\n{{remote administration software}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Microsoft server technology]]\n[[Category:Remote desktop]]\n[[Category:Windows components]]\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Remote desktop protocols]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNon-Microsoft implementations:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: There\u2019s \u2192 There's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol"}

[[AEG]] started developing the first devices in 1935. In mid-1943, the German Army began the first tests with infrared night-vision ({{lang-de|Nachtj\u00e4ger}}) devices and telescopic rangefinders mounted on [[Panther tank]]s. Two different arrangements were created and used on Panther tanks. The Sperber FG 1250 (\"Sparrow Hawk\"), with range up to 600 m, had a 30&nbsp;cm infrared searchlight and an image converter operated by the tank commander.\n\nAn experimental Soviet device called the PAU-2 was field-tested in 1942.\n\nFrom late 1944 to March 1945, there were some successful tests by the German military of FG 1250 sets mounted on Panther Ausf G tanks (and other variants). By the end of World War II, approximately 50 (or 63) Panthers had been equipped with the FG 1250 and saw combat on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Fronts]].

Electrons that strike the phosphor screen cause the phosphor to produce photons of light viewable through the eyepiece lenses.]]\n\nThe [[US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate]] (NVESD) is part of the governing body that dictates the name of the generation of night-vision technologies. This was originally the Army Night Vision Laboratory (NVL), which worked within the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|US Army Research Labs]]. Although the recent increased performance associated with the GEN-III OMNI-VI/VII components is impressive, the US Army has not yet authorized the use of the name GEN-IV for these components.\n\nGEN-III OMNI-V\u2013VII devices developed in the 2000s can differ from standard generation 3 in one or both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated [[power supply]] system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvisionoptics.com/files/docs/articles/articleletmay2007.pdf |title=\\\\Baksan\\Shared Docs\\For Candace\\New Folder\\LET.tif<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=nvisionoptics.com |accessdate=16 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228062011/http://www.nvisionoptics.com/files/docs/articles/articleletmay2007.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2850&nbsp;K of only 700, compared to operating with a luminous sensitivity of at least 1800 for GEN III image intensifiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nivitech.com/nightvision-gns.htm |title=www.nivitech.com / Nightvision Technology / Principles of Nightvision Devices<!-- Bot generated title --> |author= |date= |website=nivitech.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>  The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical {{val|20,000|ul=h}} mean time to failure (MTTF) for Gen III type, to {{val|15,000|u=h}} MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach {{val|15,000|u=h}} of operation before replacement.\n\nWhile the consumer market classifies this type of system as ''generation 4'', the United States military describes these systems as ''generation 3 autogated'' tubes (GEN-III OMNI-VII). Moreover, as autogating power supplies can now be added to any previous generation of night-vision devices, \"autogating\" capability does not automatically class the devices as a GEN-III OMNI-VII. Any postnominals appearing after a generation type (i.e., Gen II+, Gen III+) do not change the generation type of the device, but instead indicates an advancement(s) over the original specification's requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atncorp.com/HowNightVisionWorks#gen11 |title=How Night Vision Works in night vision Goggles, Scopes, Binoculars, Riflescopes |author= |date= |website=www.atncorp.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples:\n* [[AN/PVS-22]]<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nightvis.com/nv_sights/ANPVS22_Universal_Night_Sight.html |title=nightvis.com |author= |date= |website=www.nightvis.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n* [[NVS-22]]\n\n====Auto-gating====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe ATG function was designed to improve the Bright-Source Protection (BSP){{clarify|date=October 2018}} feature to be faster and to keep the best resolution and contrast at all times. It is particularly suitable for aviator's night-vision goggles, operations in urban areas or for special operations. ATG is a unique feature that operates constantly, electronically reducing the \u201cduty cycle\u201d of the photocathode voltage by very rapidly switching the voltage on and off. This maintains the optimal performance of the I\u00b2 tube, continuously revealing mission-critical details, safeguarding the I\u00b2 tube from additional damage and protecting the user from temporary blindness.\n\nThe benefits of ATG can easily be seen not only during day\u2013night\u2013day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low-light to high-light conditions (above {{val|1|ul=lx}}), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a weapon sight, which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures taken at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain \u201ceyes on target\u201d.\n\nATG provides added safety for pilots when flying at low altitudes, and especially during takeoffs and landings. Pilots operating with night-vision goggles are constantly subjected to dynamic light conditions when artificial light sources, such as from cities, interfere with their navigation by producing large halos that obstruct their field of view.\n\n====Figure of merit====\nIn the late 1990s, innovations in photocathode technology significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio, with newly developed tubes starting to surpass the performance of Gen 3 tubes.\n\nBy 2001, the United States federal government concluded that a tube's \u201cgeneration\u201d was not a determinant factor of a tube's global performance, making the term \u201cgeneration\u201d irrelevant in determining the performance of an image-intensifier tube, and therefore eliminated the term as a basis of export regulations.\n\nThough image-intensification technology employed by different manufacturers varies, from the tactical point of view, a night-vision system is an optical device that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself makes little difference, as long as an operator can see clearly at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called ''[[figure of merit]]'' (FOM). The method of FOM calculation and its implications for export are briefly described in a [[National Defense University]] document called \u201cThe NATO Response Force\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA450219 |title=The NATO Response Force |author=Jeffrey P.

The lens has a thin strip of [[graphene]] between layers of glass that reacts to photons to make dark images look brighter.  Current prototypes only absorb 2.3% of light, so the percentage of light pickup has to rise before the lens can be viable.  The graphene technology can be expanded into other uses, like car windshields, to increase night driving abilities.  The US. Army is interested in the technology to potentially replace night-vision goggles.<ref>[http://defensetech.org/2014/03/28/scientists-develop-night-vision-contact-lens/ Scientists Develop Night Vision Contact Lens].

It is particularly sensitive to infrared waves that are mid-long lengths. The Corrugated QWIP (CQWIP) broadens detection capacity by using a resonance superstructure to orient more of the electric field parallel, so that it can be absorbed. Although cryogenic cooling between 77&nbsp;K and 85&nbsp;K is required, QWID technology is considered for constant surveillance viewing due to its claimed low cost and uniformity in materials.<ref>Ratches, James A, et al.

This was originally the Army Night Vision Laboratory (NVL), which worked within the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|US Army Research Labs]]. Although the recent increased performance associated with the GEN-III OMNI-VI/VII components is impressive, the US Army has not yet authorized the use of the name GEN-IV for these components.\n\nGEN-III OMNI-V\u2013VII devices developed in the 2000s can differ from standard generation 3 in one or both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated [[power supply]] system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvisionoptics.com/files/docs/articles/articleletmay2007.pdf |title=\\\\Baksan\\Shared Docs\\For Candace\\New Folder\\LET.tif<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=nvisionoptics.com |accessdate=16 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228062011/http://www.nvisionoptics.com/files/docs/articles/articleletmay2007.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2850&nbsp;K of only 700, compared to operating with a luminous sensitivity of at least 1800 for GEN III image intensifiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nivitech.com/nightvision-gns.htm |title=www.nivitech.com / Nightvision Technology / Principles of Nightvision Devices<!-- Bot generated title --> |author= |date= |website=nivitech.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>  The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical {{val|20,000|ul=h}} mean time to failure (MTTF) for Gen III type, to {{val|15,000|u=h}} MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach {{val|15,000|u=h}} of operation before replacement.\n\nWhile the consumer market classifies this type of system as ''generation 4'', the United States military describes these systems as ''generation 3 autogated'' tubes (GEN-III OMNI-VII). Moreover, as autogating power supplies can now be added to any previous generation of night-vision devices, \"autogating\" capability does not automatically class the devices as a GEN-III OMNI-VII. Any postnominals appearing after a generation type (i.e., Gen II+, Gen III+) do not change the generation type of the device, but instead indicates an advancement(s) over the original specification's requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atncorp.com/HowNightVisionWorks#gen11 |title=How Night Vision Works in night vision Goggles, Scopes, Binoculars, Riflescopes |author= |date= |website=www.atncorp.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples:\n* [[AN/PVS-22]]<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nightvis.com/nv_sights/ANPVS22_Universal_Night_Sight.html |title=nightvis.com |author= |date= |website=www.nightvis.com |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n* [[NVS-22]]\n\n====Auto-gating====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe ATG function was designed to improve the Bright-Source Protection (BSP){{clarify|date=October 2018}} feature to be faster and to keep the best resolution and contrast at all times. It is particularly suitable for aviator\u2019s night-vision goggles, operations in urban areas or for special operations. ATG is a unique feature that operates constantly, electronically reducing the \u201cduty cycle\u201d of the photocathode voltage by very rapidly switching the voltage on and off. This maintains the optimal performance of the I\u00b2 tube, continuously revealing mission-critical details, safeguarding the I\u00b2 tube from additional damage and protecting the user from temporary blindness.\n\nThe benefits of ATG can easily be seen not only during day\u2013night\u2013day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low-light to high-light conditions (above {{val|1|ul=lx}}), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a weapon sight, which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures taken at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain \u201ceyes on target\u201d.\n\nATG provides added safety for pilots when flying at low altitudes, and especially during takeoffs and landings. Pilots operating with night-vision goggles are constantly subjected to dynamic light conditions when artificial light sources, such as from cities, interfere with their navigation by producing large halos that obstruct their field of view.\n\n====Figure of merit====\nIn the late 1990s, innovations in photocathode technology significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio, with newly developed tubes starting to surpass the performance of Gen 3 tubes.\n\nBy 2001, the United States federal government concluded that a tube\u2019s \u201cgeneration\u201d was not a determinant factor of a tube\u2019s global performance, making the term \u201cgeneration\u201d irrelevant in determining the performance of an image-intensifier tube, and therefore eliminated the term as a basis of export regulations.\n\nThough image-intensification technology employed by different manufacturers varies, from the tactical point of view, a night-vision system is an optical device that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself makes little difference, as long as an operator can see clearly at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called ''[[figure of merit]]'' (FOM). The method of FOM calculation and its implications for export are briefly described in a [[National Defense University]] document called \u201cThe NATO Response Force\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA450219 |title=The NATO Response Force |author=Jeffrey P.

The lens has a thin strip of [[graphene]] between layers of glass that reacts to photons to make dark images look brighter.  Current prototypes only absorb 2.3% of light, so the percentage of light pickup has to rise before the lens can be viable.  The graphene technology can be expanded into other uses, like car windshields, to increase night driving abilities.  The US.

The NX was, loosely, an evolution of the [[Nissan EXA|Nissan Pulsar NX/Nissan EXA]] sold from 1987\u20131990 and the Nissan Sunny Coupe lines of the 1970s and 1980s, merging the Nissan B13 and N14 lineages. The NX was released in Japan in 1990.\n\n==Models==\n===NX1600/NX2000 (North America)===\nThe NX1600 was based on the standard 1.6-litre [[Nissan Sentra|Sentra]] (engine code GA16DE), and the NX2000 was based on the 2.0&nbsp;L SE-R model (engine code SR20DE). Most models were fitted with T-Tops, whilst the remainder were hardtops. Constructed in Japan, it was sold from 1991\u20131993 in the [[United States|US]] (mainly competing with the [[Mazda MX-3]], [[Isuzu Piazza#1990\u20131992 (1990\u20131991 and 1993 in Canada)|Isuzu Piazza]], [[Toyota MR2]], and [[Honda Civic Del Sol]]). It was produced for a few more years for other countries. Its body was designed at NDI (Nissan Design International) in San Diego under the direction of NDI President Jerry Hirshberg, Blue Studio Chief Designer Allan Flowers, and staff designers Bruce Campbell and Doug Wilson.\n\nThe NX2000 model included some mechanical improvements over its SE-R sibling in the form of larger brakes and more aggressive tires on wider 6\" wheels (195/55VR-14 with 14x6\" wheels vs. the 185/60HR-14 with 14x5.5\" wheels and tires in the SE-R). The NX2000 brakes are a common aftermarket upgrade for B13 Sentra SE-Rs. The NX2000 also had a center armrest, a larger two-core radiator, and slightly lower ride height compared to the SE-R. However, the T-top roof in the NX2000 along with the mechanical upgrades made it slightly heavier than the SE-R.\n\nThe NX2000, with its light weight, stiff chassis, and limited-slip differential, was considered one of the best-handling front-wheel-drive cars of the time. In 1992, [[Road & Track]] magazine included the NX2000 in a test of the world's best-handling cars against such competition as the [[Acura NSX]], [[Porsche 911]], [[Nissan 300ZX]], [[Mazda Miata]], and [[Lotus Elan]].\n\n===100NX (Europe)===\n[[File:Nissan 100NX 2.0 16V T-bar, rear left.jpg|thumb|Rear view of a Nissan 100NX 2.0 16V T-bar (Germany)]]\nThe 100NX came with two engine options, a 1.6&nbsp;L and a 2.0&nbsp;L.\n\nThe 1.6&nbsp;liter, made from 1990 to February 1993 had a [[carburetor]] fitted which tended to consume excessive fuel as it aged. From April 1993 to 1996, the 100NX was sold with a more efficient [[fuel injected]] setup. In November 1993 a version called the SR appeared. This stands for \"Steel Roof\" as this slightly sportier model was lighter and more rigid. The SR's engine produced somewhat more power than the regular GA16DS thanks to a modified control unit and an enlarged intake manifold. The gearing was also shorter than for the regular 1.6.\n\n*1.6 with ECU carbureted \u2014 {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|lk=in|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 Non ECU carbureted \u2014 {{convert|95|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|102|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} SR model\n*2.0 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} North American version\n*2.0 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|143|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\nThe 1.6&nbsp;liter fuel injected version achieved {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 10.5 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|121|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 100NX was mainly sold with a T-bar removable roof in Europe although this does vary from country to country. Specialised Badged Editions sold only in 1995 include the \"Pacific\" in Ireland and the United Kingdom and the \"Sail\" in the Netherlands. Features vary from country to country, such features include heated seats, electric windows, other differences although rarer include cup holders, umbrella holder embedded in the driver's side B-pillar, and headlight wipers.\n\n===100NX (UK)===\n\nThe Nissan 100NX was initially introduced in the UK in April 1991 as part of the [[Nissan Pulsar]] range replacing the [[Nissan Sunny]] 1.6 GSX Coupe. At this time Nissan UK, the British importer were in a heated dispute with [[Nissan Motor Corporation]] over profit margins. In an attempt to deliberately shrink market share Nissan UK launched the entire Pulsar range with no promotion as well as only providing a limited colour range and pricing all models well above their position in the market. At launch the 100NX was only available with the 1.6L 95&nbsp;PS carburetor engine, and in a basic specification, priced at \u00a314,585, the same price as a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Toyota MR2]] and \u00a31,000 more than the 2.0L [[Honda Prelude]]. T-bar roof and automatic transmission were optional. In January 1992 Nissan Motor Corporation set up their own importer (Nissan Motor (GB) LTD) and relaunched the entire Nissan Range, the 100NX now coming with alloy wheels, T-bar roof and front foglights as standard at a lower price of \u00a311,817 and was available in a full range of colours.\n\nFrom February 1993 to 1996, the 100NX the carburetor engine was replaced by a more efficient [[fuel injected]] setup.\n\n*1.6 Non-ECU carbureted \u2014 {{convert|89|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|101|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n\n===NX Coup\u00e9 (Japan)===\nThe Nissan NX was also sold in the Japanese domestic market as the Nissan NX Coup\u00e9. Some models were fitted with T-Tops, whilst others were hardtop. The Japanese domestic NX Coup\u00e9s came with either a 1.5 [[DOHC]] carburetted engine (GA15(DS)), a 1.6 DOHC EFI engine (GA16(DE)), a 1.8 DOHC EFI engine (SR18(DE)) or the rare 2.0 DOHC EFI engine (SR20DE). The model was available in automatic or manual transmission. The 1.5 DOHC models were all fitted with digital speedometers, whilst all other engine versions had the standard analogue gage. All Japanese domestic models were fitted with electric windows, [[air conditioning]], power steering, electric mirrors and central locking which locked the doors automatically at 18&nbsp;km/h whilst driving, and was exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Cherry Store]]'' Japanese dealerships.\n\n===NX Coup\u00e9/NX-R (Australia)===\n[[File:1993 Nissan NX (B13) R coupe (2003-02-01) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\n[[File:1994 Nissan NX (B13) R coupe (2016-01-04) 02.jpg|thumb|Nissan NX-R (B13) in Australia.]]\nThe Nissan NX was also sold in the Australian market as the Nissan NX Coup\u00e9. A range topping model known as the NX-R included an added front lip with fog/driving lights, side skirts, lip rear spoiler, 14\" Alloy Wheels (N14 SSS Pulsar), cruise control, leather steering wheel and gear knob, electric windows and ABS (Anti-lock Braking System). Both models were only ever offered with the powerful 105&nbsp;kW/178Nm 2.0L naturally aspirated inline 4 cylinder engine (SR20DE). The NX also came with a choice between a smooth 4-speed automatic gearbox or a sporty 5-speed manual. Unfortunately, no LSD (Limited Slip Differential) was offered in Australia for the NX range. It has a claimed 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 8.2 seconds<ref>https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/nissan-100-nx-1991.html#aeng_nissan-100-nx-1990-20-gti</ref> and with a combined fuel consumption figure of just 8.4L/100&nbsp;km would be considered above average.\n\n==Safety==\nIn [[Australia]], the 1991-96 Nissan NX was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing \"significantly worse than average\" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.<ref>[http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/vrne/vrne5nav.nsf/childdocs/-B8F8655488907260CA256FD300241C1A-667BCFE41674A389CA256FD300241C2B-1EE471300C4801C3CA2570A400083B3F?open ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519194933/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/vrne/vrne5nav.nsf/childdocs/-B8F8655488907260CA256FD300241C1A-667BCFE41674A389CA256FD300241C2B-1EE471300C4801C3CA2570A400083B3F?open |date=May 19, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Racing==\n\n===Land speed records===\n;2011: Reg Cook Motor Sport set a new Class G/ Pro world record land speed class record at Bonneville speed week of 279.24 km/h (174.525 mph), using a Nissan NX Coupe 1999 cc SR 20 Eng\n\n===North America===\n\n====SCCA Showroom Stock B====\n\nSoon after its import into the United States, the NX2000 was classified by the Sports Car Club of America ([[SCCA]]) into its Showroom Stock B category for the 1992 year, pitting it against such cars as [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] Turbo (defending SSB champion Gerald Alaimo and others), its B13 cousin the [[Nissan Sentra]] SE-R (David Daughtery and others), and the sole second-generation [[Toyota MR2]] (driven by Dane Pitaressi). The NX2000 posted several National wins throughout the year, and garnered much attention from competitors. The 1992 SSB SCCA Runoffs championships saw two podium finishes for the NX2000, with the gold medal taken home by Mark Youngquist, followed by Ken Payson in a Mirage, then Greg Amy in his NX2000 taking home third place.\n\nThe 1993 season proved it wasn't a fluke, as David Daughtery took home yet another SCCA Runoffs championship for the NX2000. However, by that time the 1993 MR-2 with its updated suspension and the much-improved S14 version of the [[Nissan 240SX]] came along; while the NX2000 continued to be campaigned nationally, and sporadically posted wins throughout subsequent racing seasons, it never again won a Runoffs championship (Tony Suever won in '94 with the MR-2, and the '95 and '96 SSB championships were won by Daughtery in the S14 240SXh.<ref>http://www.nissannews.com/site_library/events/nissan/motorsport/2002/sccachampions.doc</ref>) The car timed out for eligibility for SSB racing soon thereafter.\n\n====SCCA Improved Touring====\nThe Nissan NX2000 and the Sentra SE-R were soon approved for SCCA's [[Improved Touring]] category. At the time of its initial classification - due primarily to their larger (2.0-liter) displacement - they were dropped into the ITS, or Sports, class. This pitted them against other larger-displacement, GT-class cars such as the Mazda RX-7 and BMW 325. The cars languished in ITS for several years; despite a few sporadic oddball wins in ITS (\"Crazy Joe\" DiMinno in his Sentra SE-R at [[Watkins Glen International]] in the rain in 2003) due to its very low chances of winning it garnered very little interest from competitors. Further, despite numerous requests from SCCA competitors it was never re-classified into a lower class (such as ITA, with the Acura Integra, Honda CRX Si, [[Saturn SC]], etc.).\n\nIn 2001, Kakashi Racing from [[Connecticut]] began to prepare both a Nissan NX2000 for former SSB driver Greg Amy and provide support for DiMinno in his Sentra (the NX of Greg Amy was the same chassis he used in the '92 Runoffs). At the same time they began an effort to convince SCCA that the car belonged in ITA. They coordinated efforts with Kirk Knestis to form a sub-group called \"Improved Touring 2\" to bring attention to the \"orphaned\" 2-liter front-wheel-drive cars languishing in ITS. In 2004 SCCA announced a complete re-vamp of the IT classification process, placing both Nissan B13 cars into ITA for the 2005 racing season. The end result was a 2006 [[American Road Race of Champions]] (ARRC) ITA win at [[Road Atlanta]] for Greg Amy and Kakashi Racing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrc-online.com/results_2006/2006ARRC_Grp4RACE.pdf |format=PDF |title=Temporarily Disabled |publisher=Arrc-online.com |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723120501/http://www.arrc-online.com/results_2006/2006ARRC_Grp4RACE.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDue to this success the car has again garnered a lot of attention from competitors, and a resurgence of entries for both the NX2000 and Sentra SE-R in Improved Touring is expected.\n\n====Professional Race Series====\n* 1991: Richard Laporte and others.

The NX was, loosely, an evolution of the [[Nissan EXA|Nissan Pulsar NX/Nissan EXA]] sold from 1987\u20131990 and the Nissan Sunny Coupe lines of the 1970s and 1980s, merging the Nissan B13 and N14 lineages. The NX was released in Japan in 1990.\n\n==Models==\n===NX1600/NX2000 (North America)===\nThe NX1600 was based on the standard 1.6-litre [[Nissan Sentra|Sentra]] (engine code GA16DE), and the NX2000 was based on the 2.0&nbsp;L SE-R model (engine code SR20DE). Most models were fitted with T-Tops, whilst the remainder were hardtops. Constructed in Japan, it was sold from 1991-1993 in the [[United States|US]] (mainly competing with the [[Mazda MX-3]], [[Isuzu Piazza#1990\u20131992 (1990\u20131991 and 1993 in Canada)|Isuzu Piazza]], [[Toyota MR2]], and [[Honda Civic Del Sol]]). It was produced for a few more years for other countries. Its body was designed at NDI (Nissan Design International) in San Diego under the direction of NDI President Jerry Hirshberg, Blue Studio Chief Designer Allan Flowers, and staff designers Bruce Campbell and Doug Wilson.\n\nThe NX2000 model included some mechanical improvements over its SE-R sibling in the form of larger brakes and more aggressive tires on wider 6\" wheels (195/55VR-14 with 14x6\" wheels vs. the 185/60HR-14 with 14x5.5\" wheels and tires in the SE-R). The NX2000 brakes are a common aftermarket upgrade for B13 Sentra SE-Rs. The NX2000 also had a center armrest, a larger two-core radiator, and slightly lower ride height compared to the SE-R. However, the T-top roof in the NX2000 along with the mechanical upgrades made it slightly heavier than the SE-R.\n\nThe NX2000, with its light weight, stiff chassis, and limited-slip differential, was considered one of the best-handling front-wheel-drive cars of the time. In 1992, [[Road & Track]] magazine included the NX2000 in a test of the world's best-handling cars against such competition as the [[Acura NSX]], [[Porsche 911]], [[Nissan 300ZX]], [[Mazda Miata]], and [[Lotus Elan]].\n\n===100NX (Europe)===\n[[File:Nissan 100NX 2.0 16V T-bar, rear left.jpg|thumb|Rear view of a Nissan 100NX 2.0 16V T-bar (Germany)]]\nThe 100NX came with two engine options, a 1.6&nbsp;L and a 2.0&nbsp;L.\n\nThe 1.6&nbsp;liter, made from 1990 to February 1993 had a [[carburetor]] fitted which tended to consume excessive fuel as it aged. From April 1993 to 1996, the 100NX was sold with a more efficient [[fuel injected]] setup. In November 1993 a version called the SR appeared. This stands for \"Steel Roof\" as this slightly sportier model was lighter and more rigid. The SR's engine produced somewhat more power than the regular GA16DS thanks to a modified control unit and an enlarged intake manifold. The gearing was also shorter than for the regular 1.6.\n\n*1.6 with ECU carbureted \u2014 {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|lk=in|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 Non ECU carbureted \u2014 {{convert|95|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\n*1.6 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|102|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} SR model\n*2.0 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} North American version\n*2.0 fuel injected \u2014 {{convert|143|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}\nThe 1.6&nbsp;liter fuel injected version achieved {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 10.5 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|121|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 100NX was mainly sold with a T-bar removable roof in Europe although this does vary from country to country. Specialised Badged Editions sold only in 1995 include the \"Pacific\" in Ireland and the United Kingdom and the \"Sail\" in the Netherlands. Features vary from country to country, such features include heated seats, electric windows, other differences although rarer include cup holders, umbrella holder embedded in the driver's side B-pillar, and headlight wipers.\n\n===100NX (UK)===\n\nThe Nissan 100NX was initially introduced in the UK in April 1991 as part of the [[Nissan Pulsar]] range replacing the [[Nissan Sunny]] 1.6 GSX Coupe. At this time Nissan UK, the British importer were in a heated dispute with [[Nissan Motor Corporation]] over profit margins.

The road follows the ancient Roman route which runs north-east from Rome to [[Nomentum]] or [[Mentana]]. The area was an Imperial family estate, and the bodies of the sisters were both brought considerable distances to be buried there: [[Ammianus]] records that Constantina's body was brought back from [[Bithynia]], and Helena's from [[Gaul]] (''History'' XIV: 11, 6).{{sfn|Webb|2001|pp=250-1}}\n\nThe mausoleum was built over the [[Catacombs of Saint Agnes|catacombs]] that contained the relics of Saint Agnes, who was martyred as a thirteen-year-old, and which was attached to the ancient basilica of Saint Agnese mid-way along the liturgical north side.<ref name=roth/> The basilica was originally a \"funerary hall\" rather than a church in the modern sense. Later legend considerably elaborated Constantina's devotion to Saint Agnes, but it now cannot be determined if this was a factor in the choice of location, although in general terms early Christians believed that their souls benefited from being buried close to martyrs, which was almost certainly a major attraction of the funerary hall to those who paid to be buried in it. Attaching an important mausoleum as an annex to a church was a common practice in Rome and can be seen the cases of other Roman churches such as the [[Mausoleum of Helena]] (Constantine's mother, not his daughter), which was attached to the basilica of [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros]], now a ruin.{{sfn|Krautheimer|1979|p=66}} \n[[File:Constantinian Basilica - Sant'Agnese fuori le mura - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright= 1.5|View into the apse of the ruined basilica, from in front of Santa Costanza]]\nOf the original Basilica of St Agnese, only about a third of the main outer wall survives, from the north side and the apse at the eastern end, but at less than the original height. By the 7th-century the basilica had fallen into ruins and was too large to be refurbished, and the current much smaller Basilica of [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] was built to replace it, a few metres away.\n\n===Purpose===\nIt was traditionally thought that construction began during the reign of [[Emperor Constantine I]] or shortly after, as an early history, the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', records that [[Pope Silvester I]] (d. 335) baptized Constantina and her paternal aunt in a [[baptistry]] built by Constantine there at the same time as the funerary hall. This was assumed to be the structure that survives. But excavations in 1992 discovered an earlier building beneath, and the existing building is now dated to around 350 AD.<ref>{{harvnb|Webb|2001|p=249}}; for a superimposed plan of the two buildings see [[:File:Santakonstanza mausoleo oinplano.jpg]]</ref>\n\nThe structure of Santa Costanza reflects its original function as the mausoleum of one or both Constantine's two daughters, Constantia and Helena, rather than as the church it became much later. The centralized design put \"direct physical emphasis on the person or place to be honored\"<ref name=\"MichaelGough\">Michael Gough, ''The Origins of Christian Art'' (New York: Praeger Publishers, Inc., 1973), 58.</ref> and was popular for mausoleums and places of baptisms at this time. Other early Christian buildings with a similar origin and a circular plan include [[Split Cathedral]], built within [[Diocletian's Palace]] as his mausoleum, and the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] (now the Church of St. George]] in [[Thessaloniki]] built as a mausoleum for [[Galerius]].<ref name=\"MichaelGough\" />\n\nThe huge funerary hall or Constantinian basilica gradually fell out of use and into ruins, with the base of the wall now surviving for about a third of the original circuit of exterior walls, but Santa Costanza has survived all but intact. It is documented that [[Pope Nicholas I]] celebrated mass there in 865, the first time that \"Santa Costanza\" is recorded as its name, but its consecration as a church was not until 1254, by [[Pope Alexander IV]], who had what were believed to be the remains of Constantia removed from the larger sarcophagus and placed under a central altar.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:S Costanza - facciata 1160930.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.25|The facade today]]\n\n===Structure===\nSanta Costanza is a circular, centralized structure, with a circular [[ambulatory]] ringing a high central space topped by a shallow dome, which is raised on a round [[Tholobate|drum]], as can be seen from the exterior. It is built of brick-faced concrete and its structure is basically two rings supported by columns placed around a vertical central axis. The upper ring sits on the columns while the \"lower ring encloses a circular ambulatory whose space flows between the columns into the axial cylinder.\"<ref>William L. MacDonald, ''Early Christian & Byzantine Architecture'' (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1962), 22.</ref> This design essentially creates two spaces or two worlds, that of the ambulatory and that of the upper dome. The screens of the ambulatory and inner ring create a dark contrast to the bright upper space of the dome. This contrast of light can be seen in the picture of the main interior. The single door, flanked by two arched niches, would originally have been an internal arch or doorway leading straight into the Constaninian basilica or funerary hall, half-way along its length. There is a short vestibule inside the door, opening to the ambulatory. \n[[File:Wide angle view - Santa Costanza - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view.]]\nAn arched arcade with twelve pairs of granite columns decorated with [[composite order|composite capitals]] supports the drum below the dome, and separates the area of the ambulatory beyond, which is much darker, as light from twelve windows in the [[clerestory]] does not reach this area as well. In contrast the central area is well-lit, creating interplay between dark and light in the interior.\n\nThe number of arches, pairs of columns and windows could be a reference to the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Opposite the entrance in this central space there is \"a kind of baldacchino...rises above a porphyry plaque which, below the middle arch of the center room, once seems to have carried the princess's sarcophagus\".{{sfn|Krautheimer|1979|p=68}} This is where the sarcophagus of Constantina, or perhaps the second one, would have rested. The ambulatory is [[barrel-vault]]ed and is 22.5 meters or 74 feet in diameter.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The ambulatory has most of the surviving mosaics in the church. Larger arches mark the cardinal points in the mausoleum. The walls were probably covered in slabs of colourful marble, as was usual in imperial buildings. Santa Costanza was also to some extent a new type of building. It was different from earlier styles in that the roof, which would previously have been typically flat and made with wood, was instead designed as a dome and vault.<ref>Walter Lowrie, ''Monuments of the Early Church'' (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1923), 139.</ref>\n\n===Decoration===\n[[File:RomaSCostanzaInterno1.jpg|thumb|The mosaics of the ambulatory vault and the paired columns]]\n\n====Mosaics====\nThe mosaics of Santa Costanza are important examples of [[Early Christian art]], and even rarer examples of secular palace ceiling mosaics. The [[apse]]s, central dome, and ambulatory all had mosaic decoration, though that in the dome no longer survives.\n\n====Mosaics in the apses====\n[[File:Santa Costanza. Mosaic del S. VII \u201cTraditio Legis\u201d adjusted.JPG|thumb|Mosaic with the ''[[Traditio Legis]]'']]\nIn the ambulatory wall there are two shallow apses, each with a mosaic showing Christ as the [[Pantocrator]], the earliest surviving examples of this depiction; they probably date to the 5th or 7th century, though there has been much discussion of this.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}} Like many mosaics of the period, both have suffered from restoration and both show elements of Roman imperial imagery, representing early examples of the conflation of this with Christian art. A mosaic with two women wearing white, reported as being behind the sarcophagus in the Renaissance, has now gone and was never drawn.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}\n\nOne of the apses shows a ''[[traditio legis]]'': Christ is shown with Saints Peter and Paul giving Peter the scroll representing law, with the inscription, \"DOMINUS PACEM DAT,\" or \"The Lord is giving Peace.\" A few sheep represent his role as shepherd governing and leading his flock. Christ is clothed in golden robes, suggesting his power and supremacy. He is shown rising above paradise, which further shows his dominance over both heaven and earth.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=95}}\n\nIn the second apse, Christ appears somewhat more simply but still as supremely powerful. His robes are not quite as rich as in the other apse, but still suggest power. He wears a simple tunic but it is purple and gold. This suggests not only holy power, but human power given that purple is the color of royalty and the gold stripes suggestion a connection to the Roman emperors. Peter also approaches Christ in supplication, like one would approach the Emperor. This is one of the first examples in Christian art of Christ being portrayed in the same way as the emperor or royalty. It is a concept that would later be prevalent in Christian art and architecture. In this apse Christ is not just portrayed as royalty but as the ruler of the world, of all existence. He sits atop a blue sphere, a clear symbol for the world or universe. From this perch he hands keys to Peter. This is a clear sign of Christ, and the power of heaven, giving authority and holy power to man. It is also important to note that Peter was Rome's first bishop so this meant Roman authority was sanctioned by God. This concept and picture of Christ as the almighty ruler and creator of the world would be the norm in the artwork of later churches, but it first appears here at Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=96}}\n\n====Mosaics in the ambulatory====\n[[File:RomaSCostanzaMosaici02.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the ambulatory]]\nThe 4th-century mosaics on the ambulatory vault are contemporary with the building, and show a stark contrast to those in the apses, being essentially secular, with panels containing geometric patterns, small heads or figures within compartmented frames, birds with branches of foliage, vases and other objects, and vine patterns with cherubs harvesting and wine-making. This last type of scene also appears on Constantina's sarcophagus, as it does on the ends of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]]. While the mosaics of the apses have very clear Christian imagery, those in the ambulatory are much more secular and could be considered Dionysiac with their images of grapes, fruit, birds, and mythological figures.<ref name=Beckwith70_12>{{harvnb|Beckwith|1970|p=12}}.</ref> This is especially true of the floor mosaics which were similar in style to those in the ambulatory, filled with cupids, birds, and Bacchus and grapevines. This may reflect the merging of pagan and Christian values in Rome,<ref>Marilyn Stokstad, ''Medieval Art'' (New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1986), 29.</ref> or alternatively construction under the non-Christian Julian.{{r|Ossian}}  These mosaics probably represent the sort of decoration found in the Imperial palaces of the period, and in general have needed little restoration.\n\n====Central dome====\nThe mosaics of the central dome no longer exist, but a picture of them can still be reconstructed as between 1538 and 1540 [[Francisco de Holanda]] made watercolour copies of what then survived. In these several biblical scenes appear, resembling catacomb paintings from the 3rd century, including Susanna and the Elders, Tobias, the sacrifice of Cain and Abel, the sacrifice of Elias on Mount Carmel, possibly Lot receiving the angels, Moses striking the rock for water, and possibly even Noah building the ark. The upper row of mosaics, largely missing by the 16th century, is thought to have had scenes from the New Testament since it has the Miracle of the Centurion. These mosaics have [[caryatid]]s and acanthus-scrolls and a calendar of saints in the upper row.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} This, in conjunction with the two apses is where the majority of Christian imagery occurs.\n\n===Sarcophagi===\n[[Image:0 Sarcofago di Costantina - Museo Pio-Clementino - Vatican (1).JPG|thumb|Sarcophagus of Constantina, [[Vatican Museums]], originally stood in the mausoleum]]\nTwo large porphyry sarcophagi from the church are now in the Vatican; the larger and more famous (illustrated) in the [[Vatican Museums]], where it was moved during the late 18th century and is on display.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The smaller was moved in St Peter's itself (left transept) in 1606. It is now thought that the larger sarcophagus traditionally related to Constantina may in fact have housed her sister Helena, and the less spectacular one, also removed to the Vatican, was actually Constantina's.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=252}}\n\nConstantina's sarcophagus has complex symbolic designs in [[relief]]: \"the surface is dominated by an intricate pattern of stylized vine-stems into which are fitted cherubs...with this scene of Dionysiac exuberance, and the hope of future blessedness which it implies, two peacocks, birds of immortality, are completely in accord\".<ref name=Milburn88_77>{{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p=77}}</ref> The scene presents an image of nature and plenty complete with grape vines, sheep and birds. The putti are framed in [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] scrolls, above which there are several images of masks. Aside from the natural scene, there are also four portraits including Constantia herself, \"on the lid, four graceful portrait heads, one apparently that of Constantina, look calmly out over this assurance that the best is yet to be\".{{r|Milburn88_77}} The imagery presented of wine and nature are not inherently Christian but could be perceived as such considering the use of wine in the [[Eucharist]]. Or they could be perceived as a connection to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the God of Wine.{{r|Lowden97_43}} This style of sarcophagus would cease to be used in Rome by the end of the fourth century, and this sarcophagus of Constantia is a prime example of the style.{{r|Milburn88_77}}\n\nThe sarcophagus is massive with the chest measuring 128&nbsp;cm or 4&nbsp;ft 2{{frac|3|8}} in high, 233&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;ft 7{{frac|1|2}} in long, and 157&nbsp;cm or 5&nbsp;ft 1{{frac|3|4}} in wide.{{r|Lowden97_43}} It is made of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], a hard purple stone, reserved by the Romans for use only by the imperial family, whose colour purple was. It was quarried from only one place, Mons Porphyriticus (Coptos, Egypt), making it even more exclusive.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} It appears, but can not be certain, that the sarcophagus of Constantina is a copy of that of Constantine I, her father, which is now lost. A piece of what is believed to be his sarcophagus is similar in style and of the same material.{{sfn|Beckwith|1970|p=13}} A cast replica has been placed in the church, though in the ambulatory; presumably its original position was in the centre of the church, now occupied by the altar.  There is another in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] in the city.\n\n==Alternative views==\nSome consider that the building was only later reassigned as a church dedicated to Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|pp=95-6}}  The veneration of Constantina as \"Santa Costanza\" (Saint Constance) is only known from the 16th century onward, and her name is not included in the [[Roman Martyrology]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sch\u00e4fer |first=Joachim |year=2003 |title=\u00d6kumenisches Heiligenlexikon - Konstantia |format=CD-ROM |isbn=3-00-012997-9 |language=de |url=https://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienK/Konstantia.htm }}</ref> An original structure might be located underneath the current church, as a possibly [[Tetraconch|triconch]]-shaped structure was partially excavated in 1987 and 1992 and computer-reconstructed by David J. Stanley.{{r|Ossian}}\n\nThat could suggest that the current church is the second Christian building on the site, and may be some decades later than traditionally thought, being built as a mausoleum for Constantina's sister Helena in the reign of her husband [[Julian the Apostate]]. (This would be odd, however, because Julian was a staunch pagan.) If true, the larger of the two porphyry sarcophagi there would belong to Helena, and the smaller to Constantina, the opposite of what has been traditionally thought. The earlier triconch building of the 330s was probably indeed built for Constantina, but she later had to take second place to her sister. Then, as Constantina's fame as a saintly figure developed in the Middle Ages, their roles became reversed in the popular mind.{{r|Ossian}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Architecture of ancient Rome]]\n*[[Early Christian sarcophagi]]\n*[[Early Christian art and architecture]]\n*[[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=John |year=1970 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Art |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin Books |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Deckers |first=Johannes G. |year=2007 |title=Constantine the Great and Early Christian Art |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Krautheimer |first=Richard |year=1979 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture |publisher=Penguin Books |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lowden |first=John |year=1997 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Art |publisher=Phaidon Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Milburn |first=Robert |year=1988 |title=Early Christian Art and Architecture |publisher=Scolar Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Webb |first=Matilda |year=2001 |title=The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-190221058-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_churches_and_catacombs_of_early_Chri.html?id=Y-ROAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Blasen, Philippe Henri, \"De sancta Agnete Romana e fontibus Latinis antiquissimis...

By the 7th-century the basilica had fallen into ruins and was too large to be refurbished, and the current much smaller Basilica of [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] was built to replace it, a few metres away.\n\n===Purpose===\nIt was traditionally thought that construction began during the reign of [[Emperor Constantine I]] or shortly after, as an early history, the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', records that [[Pope Silvester I]] (d. 335) baptized Constantina and her paternal aunt in a [[baptistry]] built by Constantine there at the same time as the funerary hall. This was assumed to be the structure that survives. But excavations in 1992 discovered an earlier building beneath, and the existing building is now dated to around 350 AD.<ref>{{harvnb|Webb|2001|p=249}}; for a superimposed plan of the two buildings see [[:File:Santakonstanza mausoleo oinplano.jpg]]</ref>\n\nThe structure of Santa Costanza reflects its original function as the mausoleum of one or both Constantine's two daughters, Constantia and Helena, rather than as the church it became much later. The centralized design put \"direct physical emphasis on the person or place to be honored\"<ref name=\"MichaelGough\">Michael Gough, ''The Origins of Christian Art'' (New York: Praeger Publishers, Inc., 1973), 58.</ref> and was popular for mausoleums and places of baptisms at this time. Other early Christian buildings with a similar origin and a circular plan include [[Split Cathedral]], built within [[Diocletian's Palace]] as his mausoleum, and the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] (now the Church of St. George]] in [[Thessaloniki]] built as a mausoleum for [[Galerius]].<ref name=\"MichaelGough\" />\n\nThe huge funerary hall or Constantinian basilica gradually fell out of use and into ruins, with the base of the wall now surviving for about a third of the original circuit of exterior walls, but Santa Costanza has survived all but intact. It is documented that [[Pope Nicholas I]] celebrated mass there in 865, the first time that \"Santa Costanza\" is recorded as its name, but its consecration as a church was not until 1254, by [[Pope Alexander IV]], who had what were believed to be the remains of Constantia removed from the larger sarcophagus and placed under a central altar.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:S Costanza - facciata 1160930.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.25|The facade today]]\n\n===Structure===\nSanta Costanza is a circular, centralized structure, with a circular [[ambulatory]] ringing a high central space topped by a shallow dome, which is raised on a round [[Tholobate|drum]], as can be seen from the exterior. It is built of brick-faced concrete and its structure is basically two rings supported by columns placed around a vertical central axis. The upper ring sits on the columns while the \"lower ring encloses a circular ambulatory whose space flows between the columns into the axial cylinder.\"<ref>William L. MacDonald, ''Early Christian & Byzantine Architecture'' (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1962), 22.</ref> This design essentially creates two spaces or two worlds, that of the ambulatory and that of the upper dome. The screens of the ambulatory and inner ring create a dark contrast to the bright upper space of the dome. This contrast of light can be seen in the picture of the main interior. The single door, flanked by two arched niches, would originally have been an internal arch or doorway leading straight into the Constaninian basilica or funerary hall, half-way along its length. There is a short vestibule inside the door, opening to the ambulatory. \n[[File:Wide angle view - Santa Costanza - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view.]]\nAn arched arcade with twelve pairs of granite columns decorated with [[composite order|composite capitals]] supports the drum below the dome, and separates the area of the ambulatory beyond, which is much darker, as light from twelve windows in the [[clerestory]] does not reach this area as well. In contrast the central area is well-lit, creating interplay between dark and light in the interior.\n\nThe number of arches, pairs of columns and windows could be a reference to the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Opposite the entrance in this central space there is \"a kind of baldacchino...rises above a porphyry plaque which, below the middle arch of the center room, once seems to have carried the princess's sarcophagus\".{{sfn|Krautheimer|1979|p=68}} This is where the sarcophagus of Constantina, or perhaps the second one, would have rested. The ambulatory is [[barrel-vault]]ed and is 22.5 meters or 74 feet in diameter.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The ambulatory has most of the surviving mosaics in the church. Larger arches mark the cardinal points in the mausoleum. The walls were probably covered in slabs of colourful marble, as was usual in imperial buildings. Santa Costanza was also to some extent a new type of building. It was different from earlier styles in that the roof, which would previously have been typically flat and made with wood, was instead designed as a dome and vault.<ref>Walter Lowrie, ''Monuments of the Early Church'' (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1923), 139.</ref>\n\n===Decoration===\n[[File:RomaSCostanzaInterno1.jpg|thumb|The mosaics of the ambulatory vault and the paired columns]]\n\n====Mosaics====\nThe mosaics of Santa Costanza are important examples of [[Early Christian art]], and even rarer examples of secular palace ceiling mosaics. The [[apse]]s, central dome, and ambulatory all had mosaic decoration, though that in the dome no longer survives.\n\n====Mosaics in the apses====\n[[File:Santa Costanza. Mosaic del S. VII \u201cTraditio Legis\u201d adjusted.JPG|thumb|Mosaic with the ''[[Traditio Legis]]'']]\nIn the ambulatory wall there are two shallow apses, each with a mosaic showing Christ as the [[Pantocrator]], the earliest surviving examples of this depiction; they probably date to the 5th or 7th century, though there has been much discussion of this.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}} Like many mosaics of the period, both have suffered from restoration and both show elements of Roman imperial imagery, representing early examples of the conflation of this with Christian art. A mosaic with two women wearing white, reported as being behind the sarcophagus in the Renaissance, has now gone and was never drawn.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=251}}\n\nOne of the apses shows a ''[[traditio legis]]'': Christ is shown with Saints Peter and Paul giving Peter the scroll representing law, with the inscription, \"DOMINUS PACEM DAT,\" or \"The Lord is giving Peace.\" A few sheep represent his role as shepherd governing and leading his flock. Christ is clothed in golden robes, suggesting his power and supremacy. He is shown rising above paradise, which further shows his dominance over both heaven and earth.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=95}}\n\nIn the second apse, Christ appears somewhat more simply but still as supremely powerful. His robes are not quite as rich as in the other apse, but still suggest power. He wears a simple tunic but it is purple and gold. This suggests not only holy power, but human power given that purple is the color of royalty and the gold stripes suggestion a connection to the Roman emperors. Peter also approaches Christ in supplication, like one would approach the Emperor. This is one of the first examples in Christian art of Christ being portrayed in the same way as the emperor or royalty. It is a concept that would later be prevalent in Christian art and architecture. In this apse Christ is not just portrayed as royalty but as the ruler of the world, of all existence. He sits atop a blue sphere, a clear symbol for the world or universe. From this perch he hands keys to Peter. This is a clear sign of Christ, and the power of heaven, giving authority and holy power to man. It is also important to note that Peter was Rome's first bishop so this meant Roman authority was sanctioned by God. This concept and picture of Christ as the almighty ruler and creator of the world would be the norm in the artwork of later churches, but it first appears here at Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|p=96}}\n\n====Mosaics in the ambulatory====\n[[File:RomaSCostanzaMosaici02.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the ambulatory]]\nThe 4th-century mosaics on the ambulatory vault are contemporary with the building, and show a stark contrast to those in the apses, being essentially secular, with panels containing geometric patterns, small heads or figures within compartmented frames, birds with branches of foliage, vases and other objects, and vine patterns with cherubs harvesting and wine-making. This last type of scene also appears on Constantina's sarcophagus, as it does on the ends of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]]. While the mosaics of the apses have very clear Christian imagery, those in the ambulatory are much more secular and could be considered Dionysiac with their images of grapes, fruit, birds, and mythological figures.<ref name=Beckwith70_12>{{harvnb|Beckwith|1970|p=12}}.</ref> This is especially true of the floor mosaics which were similar in style to those in the ambulatory, filled with cupids, birds, and Bacchus and grapevines. This may reflect the merging of pagan and Christian values in Rome,<ref>Marilyn Stokstad, ''Medieval Art'' (New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1986), 29.</ref> or alternatively construction under the non-Christian Julian.{{r|Ossian}}  These mosaics probably represent the sort of decoration found in the Imperial palaces of the period, and in general have needed little restoration.\n\n====Central dome====\nThe mosaics of the central dome no longer exist, but a picture of them can still be reconstructed as between 1538 and 1540 [[Francisco de Holanda]] made watercolour copies of what then survived. In these several biblical scenes appear, resembling catacomb paintings from the 3rd century, including Susanna and the Elders, Tobias, the sacrifice of Cain and Abel, the sacrifice of Elias on Mount Carmel, possibly Lot receiving the angels, Moses striking the rock for water, and possibly even Noah building the ark. The upper row of mosaics, largely missing by the 16th century, is thought to have had scenes from the New Testament since it has the Miracle of the Centurion. These mosaics have [[caryatid]]s and acanthus-scrolls and a calendar of saints in the upper row.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} This, in conjunction with the two apses is where the majority of Christian imagery occurs.\n\n===Sarcophagi===\n[[Image:0 Sarcofago di Costantina - Museo Pio-Clementino - Vatican (1).JPG|thumb|Sarcophagus of Constantina, [[Vatican Museums]], originally stood in the mausoleum]]\nTwo large porphyry sarcophagi from the church are now in the Vatican; the larger and more famous (illustrated) in the [[Vatican Museums]], where it was moved during the late 18th century and is on display.{{r|Lowden97_43}} The smaller was moved in St Peter's itself (left transept) in 1606. It is now thought that the larger sarcophagus traditionally related to Constantina may in fact have housed her sister Helena, and the less spectacular one, also removed to the Vatican, was actually Constantina's.{{sfn|Webb|2001|p=252}}\n\nConstantina's sarcophagus has complex symbolic designs in [[relief]]: \"the surface is dominated by an intricate pattern of stylized vine-stems into which are fitted cherubs...with this scene of Dionysiac exuberance, and the hope of future blessedness which it implies, two peacocks, birds of immortality, are completely in accord\".<ref name=Milburn88_77>{{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p=77}}</ref> The scene presents an image of nature and plenty complete with grape vines, sheep and birds. The putti are framed in [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] scrolls, above which there are several images of masks. Aside from the natural scene, there are also four portraits including Constantia herself, \"on the lid, four graceful portrait heads, one apparently that of Constantina, look calmly out over this assurance that the best is yet to be\".{{r|Milburn88_77}} The imagery presented of wine and nature are not inherently Christian but could be perceived as such considering the use of wine in the [[Eucharist]]. Or they could be perceived as a connection to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the God of Wine.{{r|Lowden97_43}} This style of sarcophagus would cease to be used in Rome by the end of the fourth century, and this sarcophagus of Constantia is a prime example of the style.{{r|Milburn88_77}}\n\nThe sarcophagus is massive with the chest measuring 128&nbsp;cm or 4&nbsp;ft 2{{frac|3|8}} in high, 233&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;ft 7{{frac|1|2}} in long, and 157&nbsp;cm or 5&nbsp;ft 1{{frac|3|4}} in wide.{{r|Lowden97_43}} It is made of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], a hard purple stone, reserved by the Romans for use only by the imperial family, whose colour purple was. It was quarried from only one place, Mons Porphyriticus (Coptos, Egypt), making it even more exclusive.{{r|Beckwith70_12}} It appears, but can not be certain, that the sarcophagus of Constantina is a copy of that of Constantine I, her father, which is now lost. A piece of what is believed to be his sarcophagus is similar in style and of the same material.{{sfn|Beckwith|1970|p=13}} A cast replica has been placed in the church, though in the ambulatory; presumably its original position was in the centre of the church, now occupied by the altar.  There is another in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] in the city.\n\n==Alternative views==\nSome consider that the building was only later reassigned as a church dedicated to Santa Costanza.{{sfn|Deckers|2007|pp=95-6}}  The veneration of Constantina as \"Santa Costanza\" (Saint Constance) is only known from the 16th century onward, and her name is not included in the [[Roman Martyrology]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sch\u00e4fer |first=Joachim |year=2003 |title=\u00d6kumenisches Heiligenlexikon - Konstantia |format=CD-ROM |isbn=3-00-012997-9 |language=de |url=https://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienK/Konstantia.htm }}</ref> An original structure might be located underneath the current church, as a possibly [[Tetraconch|triconch]]-shaped structure was partially excavated in 1987 and 1992 and computer-reconstructed by David J. Stanley.{{r|Ossian}}\n\nThat could suggest that the current church is the second Christian building on the site, and may be some decades later than traditionally thought, being built as a mausoleum for Constantina's sister Helena in the reign of her husband [[Julian the Apostate]]. (This would be odd, however, because Julian was a staunch pagan.) If true, the larger of the two porphyry sarcophagi there would belong to Helena, and the smaller to Constantina, the opposite of what has been traditionally thought. The earlier triconch building of the 330s was probably indeed built for Constantina, but she later had to take second place to her sister. Then, as Constantina's fame as a saintly figure developed in the Middle Ages, their roles became reversed in the popular mind.{{r|Ossian}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Architecture of ancient Rome]]\n*[[Early Christian sarcophagi]]\n*[[Early Christian art and architecture]]\n*[[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=John |year=1970 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Art |location=Baltimore |publisher=Penguin Books |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Deckers |first=Johannes G. |year=2007 |title=Constantine the Great and Early Christian Art |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Krautheimer |first=Richard |year=1979 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture |publisher=Penguin Books |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lowden |first=John |year=1997 |title=Early Christian and Byzantine Art |publisher=Phaidon Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Milburn |first=Robert |year=1988 |title=Early Christian Art and Architecture |publisher=Scolar Press |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Webb |first=Matilda |year=2001 |title=The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-190221058-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_churches_and_catacombs_of_early_Chri.html?id=Y-ROAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Blasen, Philippe Henri, \"De sancta Agnete Romana e fontibus Latinis antiquissimis...

Based on the 2015 estimate, it is Indonesia's fourth most populous city after [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Bekasi]] with over 2.5 million inhabitants. [[Greater Bandung]] is the country's third-largest [[List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia|metropolitan area]] with over 8.5 million inhabitants.<ref>http://www.citypopulation.de/php/indonesia-jawa-admin.php</ref> Located {{convert|768|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], approximately {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Jakarta]], Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other [[List of cities in Indonesia|Indonesian cities]]. The city lies on a [[river basin]] surrounded by [[volcano|volcanic]] mountains that provides a natural defence system, which was the primary reason for the [[Dutch East Indies]] government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day [[Jakarta]]) to Bandung.\n\nThe Dutch first established tea [[plantation]]s around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ({{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northwest). In the early 20th century the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (''gemeente''), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed ''Parijs van Java'' ({{lang-nl|\"The Paris of Java\"}}).\n\nAfter [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia declared independence]] in 1945, the city experienced has experienced ongoing development and urbanisation, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km<sup>2</sup> (per square kilometre) metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people. New [[skyscraper]]s, high-rise buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. [[Natural resource]]s have been heavily exploited, particularly by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods, to a complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. In 2017 the city won a regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among major cities in [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bandung-wins-cleanest-air-award-asean/|title=Bandung Wins Cleanest Air Award From Asean|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The city is also known as a [[Smart City]], leveraging technology to improve government services and social media, that alert residents to issues such as floods or traffic jams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chandran|first1=Nyshka|title=Architect-turned-mayor transforms his hometown into Indonesia's least bureaucratic city|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/indonesian-city-of-bandung-capitalizes-on-smart-technology-under-mayor-ridwan-kamil.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|publisher=CNBC|date=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Valentina|first1=Jessicha|title=Bandung is Indonesia's leading smart city: Eco-architect|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/03/02/bandung-is-indonesias-leading-smart-city-eco-architect.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first Asian-African Conference, the [[Bandung Conference]], was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]] in 1955.

In 1906, Bandung was given the status of ''gemeente'' (municipality), and then twenty years later, ''stadsgemeente'' (city municipality).\n\nBeginning of time the early 1920s, the Dutch East Indies government made plans to move their capital from Batavia to Bandung. Accordingly, during this decade, the Dutch colonial government commenced construction of military barracks, the central government building (''Gouvernments Bedrijven'', the present-day [[Gedung Sate]]) and other government buildings. However, this plan was cut short by [[World War II]], after which the Dutch were not able to re-establish their colony due to the Indonesian Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe fertile area of the Parahyangan Mountains surrounding Bandung supports productive [[tea]] plantations.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], some of the most massive battles occurred in and around Bandung. Dutch troops were virtually absent in Java at the end of World War II. To assist the restoration of Dutch sovereignty, the [[United Kingdom|British]] took a military hold on Java's major cities, and the British military commander set an ultimatum for the Indonesian combatants in Bandung to leave the city. In response, on 24 March 1946, much of the southern part of Bandung was deliberately set alight as the combatants left; an event known as ''Bandung Lautan Api'' or the '[[Bandung Sea of Fire]]'.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |format=PDF |title=Social History of Bandung Lautan Api (Bandung Sea of Fire) 24 March 1946 |author=Sitaresmi, Ratnayu |accessdate=22 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603233047/http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the first Asian-African Conference, also known as the ''[[Bandung Conference]]'', was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]], and attended by the heads of states representing twenty-nine independent countries from Asia and Africa.<ref>Jamie Mackie, 'Bandung 1955: Non-Alignment and Afro-Asian Solidarity', [[Singapore]], Editions Didier Millet, {{ISBN|981-4155-49-7}}</ref> The conference venue was at the [[Gedung Merdeka]], the former Concordia Society building.

A striking local Sundanese roof style is clearly seen adorning the top of the campus' ceremonial hall and is embedded in his artwork.<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\nIn the same year, another Dutch architect J Gerber designed ''Gouverments Bedrijven'' (Government Companies) in line with the colonial government plan to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The building is an example of a harmonious mixture between West and East architectural styles, particularly the [[Italian Renaissance]] style of [[arch]] structures in the wings and [[pendopo]]-like structures commonly found in Java in the middle section. The building is known as [[Gedung Sate]], named after the distinguished small [[satay]]-shaped structure on the roof, and is today used as the head office of the [[West Java]] provincial government and House of Representatives.\n\nThe architectural blending of modern and native traditional was followed by several Dutch architects who shaped the city landmarks. In the 1930s, Bandung became known as an architectural laboratory due to the many Dutch architects who experimented with new architectural designs. [[Albert Aalbers]] added the [[streamline moderne]] style to the Art Deco by designing the DENIS bank (1936) and renovated the Savoy Homann Hotel (1939). [[Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker]] was one of the architects who strongly added native elements in his artworks, including the [[Villa Isola]] (1932), Hotel Preanger (1929), the regional military headquarter (1918), [[Gedung Merdeka]] (1921) and ITB Rectorate Building (1925).<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\n[[File:Bandung Cathedral Indonesia.jpg|Bandung Cathedral|upright|thumb|right|Bandung [[Cathedral]], seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bandung]]]]\nThough Bandung is known for its large number of old Dutch architecture buildings, the city is going through a high-rise building boom recently.

An intercity toll highway called [[Cipularang Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]], [[Karawang]], [[Purwakarta]], Padalarang and Bandung, was completed in May 2005 and is the fastest way to reach Bandung from the capital by road. Driving time is about 1.5 hours on average. There are three other options: the Puncak route (Jakarta-[[Cianjur]]/[[Sukabumi]]-Bandung), Purwakarta route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Purwakarta-Cikalong Wetan-Padalarang-Cimahi-Bandung) and the Subang route (Jakarta-[[Cikampek]]-[[Subang, Indonesia|Subang]]-[[Lembang]]-Bandung). From cities further east ([[Cirebon]], [[Tasikmalaya]] and [[Central Java]] province), Bandung can be accessed through the main provincial road.

Based on the 2015 estimate, it is Indonesia's fourth most populous city after [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Bekasi]] with over 2.5 million inhabitants. [[Greater Bandung]] is the country's third-largest [[List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia|metropolitan area]] with over 8.5 million inhabitants.<ref>http://www.citypopulation.de/php/indonesia-jawa-admin.php</ref> Located {{convert|768|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], approximately {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Jakarta]], Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other [[List of cities in Indonesia|Indonesian cities]]. The city lies on a [[river basin]] surrounded by [[volcano|volcanic]] mountains that provides a natural defence system, which was the primary reason for the [[Dutch East Indies]] government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day [[Jakarta]]) to Bandung.\n\nThe Dutch first established tea [[plantation]]s around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ({{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northwest). In the early 20th century the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (''gemeente''), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed ''Parijs van Java'' ({{lang-nl|\"The Paris of Java\"}}).\n\nAfter [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia declared independence]] in 1945, the city experienced has experienced ongoing development and urbanisation, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km<sup>2</sup> (per square kilometre) metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people. New [[skyscraper]]s, high-rise buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. [[Natural resource]]s have been heavily exploited, particularly by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods, to a complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. In 2017 the city won a regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among major cities in [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bandung-wins-cleanest-air-award-asean/|title=Bandung Wins Cleanest Air Award From Asean|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The city is also known as a [[Smart City]], leveraging technology to improve government services and social media, that alert residents to issues such as floods or traffic jams.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chandran|first1=Nyshka|title=Architect-turned-mayor transforms his hometown into Indonesia's least bureaucratic city|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/indonesian-city-of-bandung-capitalizes-on-smart-technology-under-mayor-ridwan-kamil.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|publisher=CNBC|date=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Valentina|first1=Jessicha|title=Bandung is Indonesia's leading smart city: Eco-architect|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/03/02/bandung-is-indonesias-leading-smart-city-eco-architect.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first Asian-African Conference, the [[Bandung Conference]], was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]] in 1955.

Accordingly, during this decade, the Dutch colonial government commenced construction of military barracks, the central government building (''Gouvernments Bedrijven'', the present-day [[Gedung Sate]]) and other government buildings. However, this plan was cut short by [[World War II]], after which the Dutch were not able to re-establish their colony due to the Indonesian Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe fertile area of the Parahyangan Mountains surrounding Bandung supports productive [[tea]] plantations.

To assist the restoration of Dutch sovereignty, the [[United Kingdom|British]] took a military hold on Java's major cities, and the British military commander set an ultimatum for the Indonesian combatants in Bandung to leave the city. In response, on 24 March 1946, much of the southern part of Bandung was deliberately set alight as the combatants left; an event known as ''Bandung Lautan Api'' or the '[[Bandung Sea of Fire]]'.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |format=PDF |title=Social History of Bandung Lautan Api (Bandung Sea of Fire) 24 March 1946 |author=Sitaresmi, Ratnayu |accessdate=22 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603233047/http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the first Asian-African Conference, also known as the ''[[Bandung Conference]]'', was hosted in Bandung by President [[Sukarno]], and attended by the heads of states representing twenty-nine independent countries from Asia and Africa.<ref>Jamie Mackie, 'Bandung 1955: Non-Alignment and Afro-Asian Solidarity', [[Singapore]], Editions Didier Millet, {{ISBN|981-4155-49-7}}</ref> The conference venue was at the [[Gedung Merdeka]], the former Concordia Society building.

A striking local Sundanese roof style is clearly seen adorning the top of the campus' ceremonial hall and is embedded in his artwork.<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\nIn the same year, another Dutch architect J Gerber designed ''Gouverments Bedrijven'' (Government Companies) in line with the colonial government plan to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The building is an example of a harmonious mixture between West and East architectural styles, particularly the [[Italian Renaissance]] style of [[arch]] structures in the wings and [[pendopo]]-like structures commonly found in Java in the middle section. The building is known as [[Gedung Sate]], named after the distinguished small [[satay]]-shaped structure on the roof, and is today used as the head office of the [[West Java]] provincial government and House of Representatives.\n\nThe architectural blending of modern and native traditional was followed by several Dutch architects who shaped the city landmarks. In the 1930s, Bandung became known as an architectural laboratory due to the many Dutch architects who experimented with new architectural designs. [[Albert Aalbers]] added the [[streamline moderne]] style to the Art Deco by designing the DENIS bank (1936) and renovated the Savoy Homann Hotel (1939). [[Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker]] was one of the architects who strongly added native elements in his artworks, including the [[Villa Isola]] (1932), Hotel Preanger (1929), the regional military headquarter (1918), [[Gedung Merdeka]] (1921) and ITB Rectorate Building (1925).<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\n[[File:Bandung Cathedral Indonesia.jpg|Bandung Cathedral|upright|thumb|right|Bandung [[Cathedral]], seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bandung]]]]\nThough Bandung is known for its large number of old Dutch architecture buildings, the city is going through a high-rise building boom recently.

The town has significant economic importance for Nepal as most of the trade with India is via Birgunj and the Indian town of [[Raxaul]]. [[Tribhuvan Highway]] links Birgunj to Nepal's capital, [[Kathmandu]]. Birganj was one of the first three municipalities formed during the rule of Prime Minister [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] It was declared a [[Metropolitan City]] on 22 May 2017 along with [[Biratnagar]] and [[Pokhara]]. Birgunj is currently the second largest city in the [[Terai]] region of Nepal after Biratnagar and Birgunj is the sixth most populated [[metropolis]] of the nation.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nBirgunj was established as a conglomerate of several villages in and around Gahawa Mai Temple. Gahawa Mai Temple remains the epicenter of the town. The settlement was named after the Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Bir Shamsher]], thus acquiring the name Birgunj.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient===\n\nBefore the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was [[Alau, Nepal]].In July 1959 From Sugauli King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.<ref name=\"Christopher Buyers,\">{{cite web |last1=Bir Bikram Shah |first1=King Rajendra |title=King Rajendra Milltary Set Up In Alau Nepal.Attacked by Jung Bahadur in Camp |url=http://www.royalark.net/Nepal/nepal7.htm |website=www.royalark.net |publisher=The Royal Ark}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\u0917\u0939\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0948 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Gahawa Mai Mandir/Maisthan Mandir]]\n\nBirgunj was founded in 1897 by 11th Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]; the ancient name was Gahawa. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages Baghi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Prasauni, Inaruwa, Chhapkaiya were existed.To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.\n\n[[File:Palace of Birgunj, Nepal.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Birgunj, Nepal Built By Bir Shamshar Rana]]\n\nAfter the dealth of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, [[Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] became Prime Minister, but within three months [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately.After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment,the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of dealth sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.\n\nChandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birganj Bazar, which his brother had established.He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat.According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market).The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.<ref name=\"Birgunj Muncipality\">{{cite web |title=How birgunj formed? |url=http://birgunjmun.gov.np/en |website=Birgunj Muncipality Nepal |publisher=Nepal Government}}</ref>\n\n===Modern===\nOn 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state.

In addition to Bhojpuri, several other languages are spoken, including [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Hindi]], [[English language|English]] and [[Newari language|Newari]].\n\n[[File:BirgunjMainRoad.jpg|thumb|Alakhiya Math, Birgunj in 1970]]\n\n==Topography, geology and soils ==\n\nBirgunj is located in the Terai plain which is the northern part of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Birgunj metropolitan city has elongated shape. The variation in altitude is in the range of 78 m to 95 m when moving from south to north of Birgunj. Although the range of altitude variation is small, but there is a high micro-topographical variation.City lies on 90m above sea level.Quaternary sediments are mainly found in the area. Soil is very fertile that consists the mixture of clay, silt and sand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/75216/36188-01-nep-tacr-18.pdf|title=Birgunj Initial Environmental Assessment}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nThe climatic condition is sub-tropical monsoon with very hot and wet summer. The mean annual temperature ranges from {{cvt|23.8 to 24.5|\u00b0C}}. The annual rainfall ranges from about {{cvt|1300 to 2800|mm}} with an average of {{cvt|1800|mm}}.

Both rivers flows from north to south. During monsoon, these rivers are flooded  and river bank cutting at the bends is common. The water level is very low in these rivers during winter. The depth of Groundwater table is approximately between {{cvt|9\u201315|m}} deep with {{cvt|1\u20132|m}} fluctuation during wet and dry season.<ref>Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Climatological Records (various volumes and years)</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[File:King Mahendra.jpg|thumb|left|Late King Mahendra at the inauguration of Birgunj Sugar Mill in 1965.]]\n\nHistory wrote in 1964 when Birgunj Sugar Factory Ltd. was established by the Government of Nepal in collaboration with the Soviet Union(At present,Russia) with initial crushing capacity of 1,000 metric tons which later increased to 1,500 metric tons (Rajak, 2006). This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy losses.\n\nBirgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this route. The Indian border town of [[Raxaul]] has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade volume.With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, plastic, cigarettes, aluminium, among others. Almost 56% of the total products of Birgunj are exported to the [[Indian state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>CPS, NEPAL 2013, Annual UN Report Bureau.</ref>\n\nBirgunj Customs holds a major contribution in terms of revenue earnings in the nation.On 16 July 2004 [[Birganj Inland Dry Port ]] came in operation to improve trade operation and address the concerns in handling the large volume of goods.\n\nThe India-Nepal oil pipeline construction that began on March 9, 2018 saw its completion up to 13 km.The 69-km Amlekhgunj-Raxaul oil pipeline connecting the two countries has been laid along the Pathlaiya-Simara-Jitpur, Parwanipur and Birgunj bypass roadway.

Vishwa Buddha Vihar, located in the out-skirts of the city. Vishwa is actually shaped like a stupa and has engravings of Lord Buddha facing the cardinal directions of the universe. This place has a tranquil ambiance and it attracts those tourists who want to flee the bustling life of the city. The term vishwa is derived from the word vicchu-wa, which is translated as a resting place for vicchu(s) or Buddhist monks and means a resting place. In the ancient times, the pilgrims stopped at Birgunj in the midst of their journey between Lumbini and Bodh Gaya (India).The mound is protected by a boundary wall, and future excavations may well tell us about the history of not just Birgunj but also its importance to Buddhism 2,500 years ago.\n\n[[Parsa National Park]] which is {{cvt|33|km}} from the city, known for inhabiting Royal Bengal Tigers ([[Panthera tigris tigris]]),Asian elephants ([[Elephas maximus]]),One-horned Rhinoceros ([[Rhinoceros unicornis]]),Common Leopard ([[Panthera pardus]]) and also various species of mammals,birds and reptiles.The park can visited by one hour drive by bus from the city.<ref name=\"Government of Nepal\">{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Parsa National Park |title=Parsa National Park |url=http://parsanationalpark.gov.np |website=Parsa National Park |publisher=Government of Nepal}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" >\nFile:Birgunj Railway.jpg|thumb|Birgunj Railway in 1974\nFile:Nepal Goverment Railway,Birgunj.jpg|thumb|Nepal Government Rail,Birgunj in 1968\n</gallery>\n\nBirgunj was built as the closest Nepalese city connecting the capital Kathmandu with India. Birgunj railway station was connected by the [[Nepal Government Railway (NGR)]] to Raxaul station in Bihar across the border with India. The {{Convert|47|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway extended north to [[Amlekhganj]] in Nepal. It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond Birgunj in December 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|title=Transport in Nepal|publisher=nepal.saarctourism.org|access-date=2008-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229011939/http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|archive-date=2008-12-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nTrains run to major cities of India from Raxaul station (in India, adjacent to Birgunj) and Sugauli station (17 miles from Raxaul) including the [[Satyagrah Express]] to [[Delhi]], [[Mithila Express]] to [[Kolkata]], Lokmanya Tilak express to [[Mumbai]], and HYD-RXL express to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Thus, Birgunj has direct connectivity to major Indian cities like - Patna, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Amritsar, Guwahati, Bhopal, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Ranchi, Raipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, etc.\n\n===Air===\nBirgunj is served by [[Simara Airport]], which lies 9 miles North of the city. Regular flights operate between Kathmandu & Simara. The second International Airport of Nepal is under construction at Nijgadh (22 miles from Birganj). There are plans to connect the new airport, Birgunj and Kathmandu via a \"Fasttrack\" expressway after its completion. This is expected to reduce travel times between the capital and the commercial capital, Birgunj\n\n===Buses===\nThere are regular bus services to all major cities and towns in Nepal including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Patan, Bhaktapur, Biratnagar, Dharan, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Kakarvitta, Janakpur, Bhairahawa(Lumbini), Bharatpur(Chitwan), etc.\nLocal bus services provide transportation inside the city and into its vicinity.

Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.\n\nGoods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal. This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, [[Hetauda]]. It is also served by [[Tribhuvan Highway]], extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to Kathmandu with frequent bus service.

The settlement was named after the Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Bir Shamsher]], thus acquiring the name Birgunj.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient===\n\nBefore the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was [[Alau, Nepal]].In July 1959 From Sugauli King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.<ref name=\"Christopher Buyers,\">{{cite web |last1=Bir Bikram Shah |first1=King Rajendra |title=King Rajendra Milltary Set Up In Alau Nepal.Attacked by Jung Bahadur in Camp |url=http://www.royalark.net/Nepal/nepal7.htm |website=www.royalark.net |publisher=The Royal Ark}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\u0917\u0939\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0948 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Gahawa Mai Mandir/Maisthan Mandir]]\n\nBirgunj was founded in 1897 by 11th Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]; the ancient name was Gahawa. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages Baghi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Prasauni, Inaruwa, Chhapkaiya were existed.To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.\n\n[[File:Palace of Birgunj, Nepal.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Birgunj, Nepal Built By Bir Shamshar Rana]]\n\nAfter the dealth of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, [[Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] became Prime Minister, but within three months [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately.After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment,the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of dealth sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.\n\nChandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birganj Bazar, which his brother had established.He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat.According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market).The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.<ref name=\"Birgunj Muncipality\">{{cite web |title=How birgunj formed? |url=http://birgunjmun.gov.np/en |website=Birgunj Muncipality Nepal |publisher=Nepal Government}}</ref>\n\n===Modern===\nOn 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state. This led to unrest by Hindu fundamentalist groups across Nepal; the town of Birgunj was forced to close for nearly two years and was disturbed for more than 10 years .<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p04s01-wosc.html Nepal's Hindu majority is denouncing the recent move to end Nepal's longtime status as the world's only Hindu state].

It serves as the headquarters of the [[Parsa District]]. Although Nepali is the official language, the native [[Bhojpuri]] language is the main language spoken. In addition to Bhojpuri, several other languages are spoken, including [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Hindi]], [[English language|English]] and [[Newari language|Newari]].\n\n[[File:BirgunjMainRoad.jpg|thumb|Alakhiya Math, Birgunj in 1970]]\n\n==Topography, geology and soils ==\n\nBirgunj is located in the Terai plain which is the northern part of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Birgunj metropolitan city has elongated shape. The variation in altitude is in the range of 78 m to 95 m when moving from south to north of Birgunj. Although the range of altitude variation is small, but there is a high micro-topographical variation.City lies on 90m above sea level.Quaternary sediments are mainly found in the area. Soil is very fertile that consists the mixture of clay, silt and sand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/75216/36188-01-nep-tacr-18.pdf|title=Birgunj Initial Environmental Assessment}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nThe climatic condition is sub-tropical monsoon with very hot and wet summer. The mean annual temperature ranges from {{cvt|23.8 to 24.5|\u00b0C}}. The annual rainfall ranges from about {{cvt|1300 to 2800|mm}} with an average of {{cvt|1800|mm}}.

Both rivers flows from north to south. During monsoon, these rivers are flooded  and river bank cutting at the bends is common. The water level is very low in these rivers during winter. The depth of Groundwater table is approximately between {{cvt|9\u201315|m}} deep with {{cvt|1\u20132|m}} fluctuation during wet and dry season.<ref>Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Climatological Records (various volumes and years)</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[File:King Mahendra.jpg|thumb|left|Late King Mahendra at the inauguration of Birgunj Sugar Mill in 1965.]]\n\nHistory wrote in 1964 when Birgunj Sugar Factory Ltd. was established by the Government of Nepal in collaboration with the Soviet Union(At present,Russia) with initial crushing capacity of 1,000 metric tons which later increased to 1,500 metric tons (Rajak, 2006). This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy losses.\n\nBirgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this route. The Indian border town of [[Raxaul]] has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade volume.With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, plastic, cigarettes, aluminium, among others. Almost 56% of the total products of Birgunj are exported to the [[Indian state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>CPS, NEPAL 2013, Annual UN Report Bureau.</ref>\n\nBirgunj Customs holds a major contribution in terms of revenue earnings in the nation.On 16 July 2004 [[Birganj Inland Dry Port ]] came in operation to improve trade operation and address the concerns in handling the large volume of goods.\n\nThe India-Nepal oil pipeline construction that began on March 9, 2018 saw its completion up to 13 km.The 69-km Amlekhgunj-Raxaul oil pipeline connecting the two countries has been laid along the Pathlaiya-Simara-Jitpur, Parwanipur and Birgunj bypass roadway.

Vishwa Buddha Vihar, located in the out-skirts of the city. Vishwa is actually shaped like a stupa and has engravings of Lord Buddha facing the cardinal directions of the universe. This place has a tranquil ambiance and it attracts those tourists who want to flee the bustling life of the city. The term vishwa is derived from the word vicchu-wa, which is translated as a resting place for vicchu(s) or Buddhist monks and means a resting place. In the ancient times, the pilgrims stopped at Birgunj in the midst of their journey between Lumbini and Bodh Gaya (India).The mound is protected by a boundary wall, and future excavations may well tell us about the history of not just Birgunj but also its importance to Buddhism 2,500 years ago.\n\n[[Parsa National Park]] which is {{cvt|33|km}} from the city, known for inhabiting Royal Bengal Tigers ([[Panthera tigris tigris]]),Asian elephants ([[Elephas maximus]]),One-horned Rhinoceros ([[Rhinoceros unicornis]]),Common Leopard ([[Panthera pardus]]) and also various species of mammals,birds and reptiles.The park can visited by one hour drive by bus from the city.<ref name=\"Government of Nepal\">{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Parsa National Park |title=Parsa National Park |url=http://parsanationalpark.gov.np |website=Parsa National Park |publisher=Government of Nepal}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" >\nFile:Birgunj Railway.jpg|thumb|Birgunj Railway in 1974\nFile:Nepal Goverment Railway,Birgunj.jpg|thumb|Nepal Government Rail,Birgunj in 1968\n</gallery>\n\nBirgunj was built as the closest Nepalese city connecting the capital Kathmandu with India. Birgunj railway station was connected by the [[Nepal Government Railway (NGR)]] to Raxaul station in Bihar across the border with India. The {{Convert|47|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway extended north to [[Amlekhganj]] in Nepal. It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond Birgunj in December 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|title=Transport in Nepal|publisher=nepal.saarctourism.org|access-date=2008-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229011939/http://nepal.saarctourism.org/transportation.html|archive-date=2008-12-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nTrains run to major cities of India from Raxaul station (in India, adjacent to Birgunj) and Sugauli station (17 miles from Raxaul) including the [[Satyagrah Express]] to [[Delhi]], [[Mithila Express]] to [[Kolkata]], Lokmanya Tilak express to [[Mumbai]], and HYD-RXL express to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Thus, Birgunj has direct connectivity to major Indian cities like - Patna, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Amritsar, Guwahati, Bhopal, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Ranchi, Raipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, etc.\n\n===Air===\nBirgunj is served by [[Simara Airport]], which lies 9 miles North of the city. Regular flights operate between Kathmandu & Simara. The second International Airport of Nepal is under construction at Nijgadh (22 miles from Birganj). There are plans to connect the new airport, Birgunj and Kathmandu via a \"Fasttrack\" expressway after its completion. This is expected to reduce travel times between the capital and the commercial capital, Birgunj\n\n===Buses===\nThere are regular bus services to all major cities and towns in Nepal including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Patan, Bhaktapur, Biratnagar, Dharan, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Kakarvitta, Janakpur, Bhairahawa(Lumbini), Bharatpur(Chitwan), etc.\nLocal bus services provide transportation inside the city and into its vicinity. Night buses from Birgunj to Kathmandu are the most luxurious bus services in all over Nepal. Birgunj bus park is the centre to find buses for any route,\n\n===Tanga===\nHorse driven carts locally called Tanga have historically been the mode of transport for the Madheshi people. Today it survives as a popular transportation vehicle between Birgunj and its sister city Raxaul.\n\n===Cargo===\nThe {{Convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway track from Raxaul to Birgunj was converted to [[broad gauge]] two years after the Indian railways converted the track to Raxaul inside India to broad gauge. Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.\n\nGoods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal. This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, [[Hetauda]]. It is also served by [[Tribhuvan Highway]], extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to Kathmandu with frequent bus service. [[Simara Airport]] \u2014 {{Convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on}} north near the highway in [[Pipara Simara]], [[Bara district]] \u2014 offers scheduled flights to Kathmandu.\n\nIndia and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on the movement of their citizens. There is a [[Geography of Nepal#Border crossing|customs checkpoint]] for the movement of goods and third country nationals.{{Clarify|date=August 2014|reason=How do they prove they are from Nepal or India without a passport?}}\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[File:Narayani Rangasala.jpg|thumb|Narayani Rangasala]]\nThe city has its own stadium, [[Narayani Stadium]] which is Nepal's second largest stadium after Dasarath Rangasala built on 2038 B.S.. The stadium has capacity of 15,000 seats.At Present,the stadium is in poor condition.\n\nA national level [[Cricket]] Ground is also located beside the Narayani Stadium. The cricket ground has top class outfield and a better [[cricket pitch]]. National level and Regional level cricket tournament are regularly held here. Every year day night [[T20 Cricket]] tournament is held using temporary flood light towers. Day night cricket match in Nepal was first played here.\n\nThe city is known as the cricket hub of Nepal and has Adarsh Nagar Stadium. [[Nepal national cricket team]]'s players [[Haseem Ansari]], [[Aarif Sheikh]], [[Avinash Karn]] and [[Irshad Ahmed]] hail from Birgunj. Cricket is the most popular sport and is played more than any other games and sports.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f \u091c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u092e\u093e \u0935\u093f.jpg|thumb|\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f \u091c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u092e\u093e \u0935\u093f]]\n\nBirgunj has some history in Education.Education was started in town with the establishment of Trijuddha School by [[Juddha Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] during his regime which was among the first three schools to be established in Nepal.\n\nThakuram Multiple Campus is the first campus (outside Kathmandu valley) in town as well as in Narayani zone.

Many local newspapers like Prateek, Loktimes Daily, Kripa, Bhojpuri Time, birgunjsanjal, Jana Aawaz etc. are published. [[TEDxBirgunj]] was successfully held on 17 December,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://facebook.com/tedxbirgunj | title=TEDxBirgunj}}</ref> that was the first ever [[TED (conference)|TED]] event conducted in Terai region of Nepal.\n\n== Health ==\nNarayani Sub-regional Hospital is one of the oldest government hospitals of Nepal. National Medical College<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nmcbir.edu.np | title=National Medical College Birgunj}}</ref> under TU and Kedia Dental College<ref>http://www.mbkediadentalcollege.com</ref> also under TU are two major institutions providing health facilities.

It is a round of the [[FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and was formerly a round of the [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]] [[British Rally Championship]] and is based in North Wales. From its first running in 1932 until the 53rd event in 1997, it was known as the '''RAC Rally''' until adopting its current name in 2003 except in 2009 when it was '''Rally of Great Britain'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1932 Royal Automobile Club Rally and Coachwork Competition===\nThe inaugural event was the 1932 [[Royal Automobile Club]] Rally, which was the first major rally of the modern era in Great Britain. Of the 367 crews entered, 341 competitors in unmodified cars started from nine different towns and cities (London, Bath, Norwich, Leamington, Buxton, Harrogate, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh.)\n\nThe Official Programme explained:\n{{quote|Different routes are followed from the nine starting points, each approximately {{convert|1000|mi|km}} long, but all finishing at Torquay. On every route there are four controls in addition to the starting and finishing controls, and these are open for periods varying from seven to four hours. Competitors may report at these controls at any time during the hours of opening.&nbsp;... At the final control they must check in as near their fixed finishing time as possible, and any considerable deviation from this time results in loss of marks.}}\n\nAs well as completing the route to a time schedule the competitors were required to perform a special test involving slow running, acceleration and braking. Additionally a [[Concours d'Elegance]] was held at the finish in Torquay. There was no official winner, although Colonel A. H. Loughborough in a [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester 15/18]] was recorded as having the fewest penalty points in the decisive test at the finish.<ref>[http://www.ukmotorsport.com/networkq/1997/history.html \"History of the RAC Rally\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180430/http://www.ukmotorsport.com/networkq/1997/history.html |date=2016-03-03 }}, UKMotorsport.com, September 23, 1997</ref>\n\n===Pre- and post-World War II years===\nThe following year's RAC Rally followed a similar format, but with [[Hastings]] as the chosen finish. Over three hundred competitors entered, and this time Miss Kitty Brunel, driving an [[AC Ace]], was the driver with the fewest penalties.\n\nThe rally was run annually until 1939, after which the outbreak of the Second World War forced its suspension. However, it resumed in 1951, and has been contested every year since with only two exceptions: 1957 (due to the [[Suez Crisis]]) and 1967 (due to the [[1967 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease]]). This latter incident was on the eve of the event, so competitors staged a mock rally at the [[Bagshot]] proving ground as consolation for the press and television (ATV had been persuaded to provide major coverage with in-car cameras for the first time).\n\n===Forest stages===\nIn 1960, organising secretary Jack Kemsley negotiated with the [[Forestry Commission]] to allow a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) section of forest road in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]] to be used as a competitive section. It proved enormously successful, and the following year forest roads all over the country were opened up to the drivers. This, combined with the introduction of special timing clocks and seeding of entries, secured the rally's future, and cemented its reputation as one of the most gruelling and unpredictable fixtures on the calendar.<ref>[http://www.carkeys.co.uk/columns/ross_finlay/1501.asp \"Jack Kemsley And The Forests\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406035157/http://www.carkeys.co.uk/columns/ross_finlay/1501.asp |date=2008-04-06 }}, Ross Finlay, CarKeys.co.uk, December 9, 2001</ref> In 2016 an agreement was reached between the MSA and [[Natural Resources Wales]] to continue to use Welsh forest stages for three years.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Forest rallying deal reached with Natural Resources Wales|date=21 September 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37429637|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Spectator Special stages===\nIn 1971, 'Spectator Stages' were introduced and, by 1975 had become an important part of the event, usually at stately homes and other public venues like [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]]. The first day was, by then, devoted to these stages. Drivers did not enjoy them, and referred to them disparagingly as \"Mickey Mouse stages\" because of the lack of challenge they offered,<ref>[http://www.rallynews.net/~rallynews.net/public_html/2001/kent01/rally_news_no8.htm Francois Duval, \"Unofficial Leaderboard after Stage 16 (final stage), Rally of Kent (Formula Rally)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122100724/http://www.rallynews.net/~rallynews.net/public_html/2001/kent01/rally_news_no8.htm |date=2005-01-22 }}, RallyNews.net</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scivi.air-nifty.com/motors/wrc/index.html |title=Michael Park, Motors Blog:WRC |publisher=Scivi.air-nifty.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}</ref> but nonetheless they contributed to the results. For example, in 1998 championship leader [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] crashed out of the rally on one of these stages, and very nearly lost that year's world championship. More recently, they have given way to the 'Super Special Stages', which are equally maligned by the drivers, but just as popular with spectators.\n\n===Group B===\n[[File:Mich\u00e8le Mouton - 1984 RAC Rally.jpg|thumb|[[Mich\u00e8le Mouton]] at the 1984 rally with an [[Audi Sport Quattro]]]]\nThe 1986 RAC Rally was the last European event for [[Group B]] vehicles. These highly tuned [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] cars were to be banned as they were deemed too powerful and dangerous, in light of the various accidents in which they were involved. In the end, the [[Peugeot 205|Peugeot 205 T16 Evo. 2]]s of [[Timo Salonen]], [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Mikael Sundstr\u00f6m]] took three of the top four places, with only [[Markku Al\u00e9n]]'s second position in the [[Lancia Delta S4]] preventing a monopoly of the podium.\n\nThere were 83 finishers out of 150 starters in 1986, compared to year of worst attrition in 1981 when only 54 of the 151 starters reached the end. This was in stark contrast to the early years: in 1938, there were only 6 retirements from 237 starters.\n\n===Title showdowns===\n{{no refs|section|date=September 2018}}\nFor many years the rally has traditionally been the last round of the World Championship, and therefore has staged many famous down-to-the-wire showdowns.\n\nIn 1991 the world championship came down-to-the-wire in the British forests, with Lancia driver [[Juha Kankkunen]] edging out Toyota's [[Carlos Sainz]] after the Spaniard suffered engine issues and went off the road in [[Kielder Forest]] and damaged his car.\n\nOne year later and Sainz and Kankkunen returned to the RAC along with Frenchman [[Didier Auriol]] to fight for the 1992 title. Auriol's challenge would end with engine failure, and Kankkunen's hopes were also dashed when he went off and damaged his steering on the final day of the rally in southern Scotland. Sainz eventually won the rally and with it claimed his second world title.\n\nIn 1995, it was estimated that around 2 million fans lined the forests to witness Scotsman [[Colin McRae]] win his second consecutive RAC Rally, and in the process beat teammate [[Carlos Sainz]] to take his first and only world title in front of thousands of fans at [[Chester Racecourse]]. McRae would have less fortune in future years; despite winning again in 1997, he was pipped to the title by Finn [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] by just one point. The Scot would come up short again in 2001 when he crashed out of an early lead, gifting the championship to his English rival [[Richard Burns]].\n\nOne of the most dramatic showdowns was 1998, when championship leader [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] crashed out on one of the spectator stages after hitting a patch of oil, and seemingly handing the title to Toyota's Carlos Sainz. However, in a cruel twist of fate Sainz's engine let go just 300 meters from the end of the final stage, handing the title back to M\u00e4kinen. \n\nIn 2003, a four-way title fight was narrowed down to just two when Burns was forced to withdraw from the event for medical reasons, which would tragically claim his life two years later, and Carlos Sainz crashed out. In the end, Norwegian [[Petter Solberg]] would win the rally ahead of [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], and consequently pip the Frenchman to claim his only world rally title by just one point.\n\n==Nordic successes==\n[[Nordic countries|Nordic]] drivers have enjoyed rich pickings in the RAC Rally through the years. Home drivers won the first six runnings of the race from 1953, when an outright winner was first declared. However, in 1960 [[Erik Carlsson]] of Sweden drove his [[Saab 96]] to a hat-trick of victories in 1960\u20131962. Of the nine drivers to have won three or more rallies, <!-- [[Colin McRae]] (1994, 1995, 1997), [[Richard Burns]] (1998\u20132000), [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] (2008\u20132010) and [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] (2013\u20132016, 2018) --> five have been [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Finland|Finns]] or [[Norway|Norwegians]]. The record for most victories is currently five, won by [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] (2013\u20132016, 2018), who surpassed Finnish [[Hannu Mikkola]] (1978\u201379, 1981\u201382) and Norwegian [[Petter Solberg]] (2002\u20132005). Though, last time a Nordic driver won Rally GB, was in 2012 ([[Jari-Matti Latvala]]).\n\n==Title sponsors==\nUntil 1970, there was no overt sponsorship, but in that year advertising decals appeared on cars and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper sponsored the event. This deal lasted four years before finance company [[Lombard North Central]] took over in 1974. The event became known as the '''Lombard RAC Rally''', and Lombard's name became synonymous with the event.\n\nFollowing Lombard's withdrawal of sponsorship after nineteen years, the rally became known as the '''Network Q RAC Rally''' and later, the '''Network Q Rally of Great Britain'''. The rally has moved its operational base to [[Cardiff]] and competitive stage mileage is concentrated in [[Wales]]. With sponsorship from the [[Welsh Government]], the event is now known as the '''Wales Rally GB'''.\n\nHowever, with such an extensive history covering the whole country, there were demands for the \"glory days\" of the old RAC Rally. In this spirit, two events have recently been established, and cover the same classic stages which are no longer part of the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] itinerary. The ''RAC Revival Rally'' uses modern, but less powerful cars, while the ''Roger Albert Clark Rally'' is a historic event using only pre-1972 machinery, and named after the first home winner of the race as a World Championship event.\n\n==2005==\n[[File:Michealparkmem.jpg|thumb|right|215px|This is a memorial on the tree for Michael Park where he lost his life.]]\nThe 2005 rally was the twelfth event on the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] schedule for 2005, held on 16\u201318 September 2005. It included the first indoor super special stage at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]].\n\nOn stage fifteen, [[Peugeot]] driver [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] crashed heavily into a tree, and while he was unharmed his co-driver [[Michael Park (rally co-pilot)|Michael Park]] sustained fatal injuries. It was the first death in the WRC in over a decade. The final two stages were cancelled and [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who would have won the event and the championship, voluntarily incurred a two-minute time penalty in order not to win under such circumstances, leaving [[Petter Solberg]] to be declared the victor.\n\nA memorial for Park was unveiled in M\u00e4rtin's homeland of [[Estonia]] and the damaged tree on the [[Margam Park]] stage of the rally where he died bears a plaque in memorial of him.\n\n== 2008 ==\nThe Wales Rally GB was the final round of the 2008 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and took place on 4\u20137 December 2008.\nWorld champion S\u00e9bastien Loeb crowned his season with victory in the rally.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081207/wl_uk_afp/autorallygbr;_ylt=AqwwYLpsay5SNISJlz4pc7B0bBAF ]{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Cardiff]] was both the start and finish point for the rally, while the service area returned to central [[Swansea]]. For the first time since 2000 the rally featured stages in [[Mid-Wales]] and there were special evening stages inside the [[Millennium Stadium]].\n\n== 2013 ==\nThe Wales Rally GB was once again the final round of the 2013 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and took place on 14\u201317 November.\n2013 World Rally Champion [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] took his first Wales Rally GB victory alongside Julien Ingrassia in the VW Polo R WRC.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/wales/24953406]</ref>\nPrevious winner [[Jari-Matti Latvala]] finished 2nd, also in a [[VW Polo]] WRC whilst young Belgian [[Thierry Neuville]] finished off the podium.\nLocal Welshman [[Elfyn Evans]] won the WRC2 category, French driver Quentin Gilbert won class 5 in the [[Citroen DS3]] R3 and teenager [[Chris Ingram (Rally driver)|Chris Ingram]] took the class 6 victory.\n\n[[Conwy Castle]] was the start and [[Llandudno]] the finish point for the rally, while the service area was based in [[Deeside]] for the first time. New stages in North Wales were used such as Gwydyr and [[Chirk Castle]].\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Event\n! Finish\n! Winner(s)\n!

It is a round of the [[FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and was formerly a round of the [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]] [[British Rally Championship]] and is based in North Wales. From its first running in 1932 until the 53rd event in 1997, it was known as the '''RAC Rally''' until adopting its current name in 2003 except in 2009 when it was '''Rally of Great Britain'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1932 Royal Automobile Club Rally and Coachwork Competition===\nThe inaugural event was the 1932 [[Royal Automobile Club]] Rally, which was the first major rally of the modern era in Great Britain. Of the 367 crews entered, 341 competitors in unmodified cars started from nine different towns and cities (London, Bath, Norwich, Leamington, Buxton, Harrogate, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh.)\n\nThe Official Programme explained:\n{{quote|Different routes are followed from the nine starting points, each approximately {{convert|1000|mi|km}} long, but all finishing at Torquay. On every route there are four controls in addition to the starting and finishing controls, and these are open for periods varying from seven to four hours. Competitors may report at these controls at any time during the hours of opening.&nbsp;... At the final control they must check in as near their fixed finishing time as possible, and any considerable deviation from this time results in loss of marks.}}\n\nAs well as completing the route to a time schedule the competitors were required to perform a special test involving slow running, acceleration and braking. Additionally a [[Concours d'Elegance]] was held at the finish in Torquay. There was no official winner, although Colonel A. H. Loughborough in a [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester 15/18]] was recorded as having the fewest penalty points in the decisive test at the finish.<ref>[http://www.ukmotorsport.com/networkq/1997/history.html \"History of the RAC Rally\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180430/http://www.ukmotorsport.com/networkq/1997/history.html |date=2016-03-03 }}, UKMotorsport.com, September 23, 1997</ref>\n\n===Pre- and post-World War II years===\nThe following year's RAC Rally followed a similar format, but with [[Hastings]] as the chosen finish. Over three hundred competitors entered, and this time Miss Kitty Brunel, driving an [[AC Ace]], was the driver with the fewest penalties.\n\nThe rally was run annually until 1939, after which the outbreak of the Second World War forced its suspension. However, it resumed in 1951, and has been contested every year since with only two exceptions: 1957 (due to the [[Suez Crisis]]) and 1967 (due to the [[1967 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease]]). This latter incident was on the eve of the event, so competitors staged a mock rally at the [[Bagshot]] proving ground as consolation for the press and television (ATV had been persuaded to provide major coverage with in-car cameras for the first time).\n\n===Forest stages===\nIn 1960, organising secretary Jack Kemsley negotiated with the [[Forestry Commission]] to allow a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) section of forest road in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]] to be used as a competitive section. It proved enormously successful, and the following year forest roads all over the country were opened up to the drivers. This, combined with the introduction of special timing clocks and seeding of entries, secured the rally's future, and cemented its reputation as one of the most gruelling and unpredictable fixtures on the calendar.<ref>[http://www.carkeys.co.uk/columns/ross_finlay/1501.asp \"Jack Kemsley And The Forests\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406035157/http://www.carkeys.co.uk/columns/ross_finlay/1501.asp |date=2008-04-06 }}, Ross Finlay, CarKeys.co.uk, December 9, 2001</ref> In 2016 an agreement was reached between the MSA and [[Natural Resources Wales]] to continue to use Welsh forest stages for three years.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Forest rallying deal reached with Natural Resources Wales|date=21 September 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37429637|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Spectator Special stages===\nIn 1971, 'Spectator Stages' were introduced and, by 1975 had become an important part of the event, usually at stately homes and other public venues like [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]]. The first day was, by then, devoted to these stages. Drivers did not enjoy them, and referred to them disparagingly as \"Mickey Mouse stages\" because of the lack of challenge they offered,<ref>[http://www.rallynews.net/~rallynews.net/public_html/2001/kent01/rally_news_no8.htm Francois Duval, \"Unofficial Leaderboard after Stage 16 (final stage), Rally of Kent (Formula Rally)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122100724/http://www.rallynews.net/~rallynews.net/public_html/2001/kent01/rally_news_no8.htm |date=2005-01-22 }}, RallyNews.net</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scivi.air-nifty.com/motors/wrc/index.html |title=Michael Park, Motors Blog:WRC |publisher=Scivi.air-nifty.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}</ref> but nonetheless they contributed to the results. For example, in 1998 championship leader [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] crashed out of the rally on one of these stages, and very nearly lost that year's world championship. More recently, they have given way to the 'Super Special Stages', which are equally maligned by the drivers, but just as popular with spectators.\n\n===Group B===\n[[File:Mich\u00e8le Mouton - 1984 RAC Rally.jpg|thumb|[[Mich\u00e8le Mouton]] at the 1984 rally with an [[Audi Sport Quattro]]]]\nThe 1986 RAC Rally was the last European event for [[Group B]] vehicles. These highly tuned [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] cars were to be banned as they were deemed too powerful and dangerous, in light of the various accidents in which they were involved. In the end, the [[Peugeot 205|Peugeot 205 T16 Evo. 2]]s of [[Timo Salonen]], [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Mikael Sundstr\u00f6m]] took three of the top four places, with only [[Markku Al\u00e9n]]'s second position in the [[Lancia Delta S4]] preventing a monopoly of the podium.\n\nThere were 83 finishers out of 150 starters in 1986, compared to year of worst attrition in 1981 when only 54 of the 151 starters reached the end. This was in stark contrast to the early years: in 1938, there were only 6 retirements from 237 starters.\n\n===Title showdowns===\n{{no refs|section|date=September 2018}}\nFor many years the rally has traditionally been the last round of the World Championship, and therefore has staged many famous down-to-the-wire showdowns.\n\nIn 1991 the world championship came down-to-the-wire in the British forests, with Lancia driver [[Juha Kankkunen]] edging out Toyota\u2019s [[Carlos Sainz]] after the Spaniard suffered engine issues and went off the road in [[Kielder Forest]] and damaged his car.\n\nOne year later and Sainz and Kankkunen returned to the RAC along with Frenchman [[Didier Auriol]] to fight for the 1992 title. Auriol\u2019s challenge would end with engine failure, and Kankkunen\u2019s hopes were also dashed when he went off and damaged his steering on the final day of the rally in southern Scotland. Sainz eventually won the rally and with it claimed his second world title.\n\nIn 1995, it was estimated that around 2 million fans lined the forests to witness Scotsman [[Colin McRae]] win his second consecutive RAC Rally, and in the process beat teammate [[Carlos Sainz]] to take his first and only world title in front of thousands of fans at [[Chester Racecourse]]. McRae would have less fortune in future years; despite winning again in 1997, he was pipped to the title by Finn [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] by just one point. The Scot would come up short again in 2001 when he crashed out of an early lead, gifting the championship to his English rival [[Richard Burns]].\n\nOne of the most dramatic showdowns was 1998, when championship leader [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]] crashed out on one of the spectator stages after hitting a patch of oil, and seemingly handing the title to Toyota's Carlos Sainz. However, in a cruel twist of fate Sainz's engine let go just 300 meters from the end of the final stage, handing the title back to M\u00e4kinen. \n\nIn 2003, a four-way title fight was narrowed down to just two when Burns was forced to withdraw from the event for medical reasons, which would tragically claim his life two years later, and Carlos Sainz crashed out. In the end, Norwegian [[Petter Solberg]] would win the rally ahead of [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], and consequently pip the Frenchman to claim his only world rally title by just one point.\n\n==Nordic successes==\n[[Nordic countries|Nordic]] drivers have enjoyed rich pickings in the RAC Rally through the years. Home drivers won the first six runnings of the race from 1953, when an outright winner was first declared. However, in 1960 [[Erik Carlsson]] of Sweden drove his [[Saab 96]] to a hat-trick of victories in 1960\u20131962. Of the nine drivers to have won three or more rallies, <!-- [[Colin McRae]] (1994, 1995, 1997), [[Richard Burns]] (1998\u20132000), [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] (2008\u20132010) and [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] (2013\u20132016, 2018) --> five have been [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Finland|Finns]] or [[Norway|Norwegians]]. The record for most victories is currently five, won by [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] (2013\u20132016, 2018), who surpassed Finnish [[Hannu Mikkola]] (1978\u201379, 1981\u201382) and Norwegian [[Petter Solberg]] (2002\u20132005). Though, last time a Nordic driver won Rally GB, was in 2012 ([[Jari-Matti Latvala]]).\n\n==Title sponsors==\nUntil 1970, there was no overt sponsorship, but in that year advertising decals appeared on cars and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper sponsored the event. This deal lasted four years before finance company [[Lombard North Central]] took over in 1974. The event became known as the '''Lombard RAC Rally''', and Lombard's name became synonymous with the event.\n\nFollowing Lombard's withdrawal of sponsorship after nineteen years, the rally became known as the '''Network Q RAC Rally''' and later, the '''Network Q Rally of Great Britain'''. The rally has moved its operational base to [[Cardiff]] and competitive stage mileage is concentrated in [[Wales]]. With sponsorship from the [[Welsh Government]], the event is now known as the '''Wales Rally GB'''.\n\nHowever, with such an extensive history covering the whole country, there were demands for the \"glory days\" of the old RAC Rally. In this spirit, two events have recently been established, and cover the same classic stages which are no longer part of the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] itinerary. The ''RAC Revival Rally'' uses modern, but less powerful cars, while the ''Roger Albert Clark Rally'' is a historic event using only pre-1972 machinery, and named after the first home winner of the race as a World Championship event.\n\n==2005==\n[[File:Michealparkmem.jpg|thumb|right|215px|This is a memorial on the tree for Michael Park where he lost his life.]]\nThe 2005 rally was the twelfth event on the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] schedule for 2005, held on 16\u201318 September 2005. It included the first indoor super special stage at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]].\n\nOn stage fifteen, [[Peugeot]] driver [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] crashed heavily into a tree, and while he was unharmed his co-driver [[Michael Park (rally co-pilot)|Michael Park]] sustained fatal injuries. It was the first death in the WRC in over a decade. The final two stages were cancelled and [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who would have won the event and the championship, voluntarily incurred a two-minute time penalty in order not to win under such circumstances, leaving [[Petter Solberg]] to be declared the victor.\n\nA memorial for Park was unveiled in M\u00e4rtin's homeland of [[Estonia]] and the damaged tree on the [[Margam Park]] stage of the rally where he died bears a plaque in memorial of him.\n\n== 2008 ==\nThe Wales Rally GB was the final round of the 2008 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and took place on 4\u20137 December 2008.\nWorld champion S\u00e9bastien Loeb crowned his season with victory in the rally.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081207/wl_uk_afp/autorallygbr;_ylt=AqwwYLpsay5SNISJlz4pc7B0bBAF ]{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Cardiff]] was both the start and finish point for the rally, while the service area returned to central [[Swansea]]. For the first time since 2000 the rally featured stages in [[Mid-Wales]] and there were special evening stages inside the [[Millennium Stadium]].\n\n== 2013 ==\nThe Wales Rally GB was once again the final round of the 2013 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] and took place on 14\u201317 November.\n2013 World Rally Champion [[S\u00e9bastien Ogier]] took his first Wales Rally GB victory alongside Julien Ingrassia in the VW Polo R WRC.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/wales/24953406]</ref>\nPrevious winner [[Jari-Matti Latvala]] finished 2nd, also in a [[VW Polo]] WRC whilst young Belgian [[Thierry Neuville]] finished off the podium.\nLocal Welshman [[Elfyn Evans]] won the WRC2 category, French driver Quentin Gilbert won class 5 in the [[Citroen DS3]] R3 and teenager [[Chris Ingram (Rally driver)|Chris Ingram]] took the class 6 victory.\n\n[[Conwy Castle]] was the start and [[Llandudno]] the finish point for the rally, while the service area was based in [[Deeside]] for the first time.
