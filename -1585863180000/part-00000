Gage is attracted to Diana and offers them one million dollars to allow him to spend a night with her.

As tension between them builds, David and Diana separate.\n\nGage renews his advances on Diana. Although she initially resists, Diana eventually consents to spending time with him and a relationship develops. David, meanwhile, hits rock bottom and then slowly pulls his life back together. When Diana files for divorce, David signs the divorce papers and gives the million dollars away.\n\nDiana tells Gage \"I think we should talk\".

An estimated 30 members and associates of [[Clan MacDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by government forces billeted with them, on the grounds they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs, [[William III of England|William III of England and II of Scotland]] and [[Mary II]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}\nIn March 1689, [[James_II_of_England|James II of England and VII of Scotland]] landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his throne and [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, Viscount Dundee]], recruited a small force of [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] for a supporting campaign in Scotland. Despite victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] on 27 July, Dundee was killed, and organised Jacobite military resistance ended with defeats at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in August 1689 and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]] in May 1690.\n\nThe continuing need to police the Highlands used resources William needed for the [[Nine Years' War]]. A peaceful Scotland was important since links between Irish and Scottish branches of the MacDonalds, as well as Scottish and [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] Presbyterians, meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other.{{sfn|Lang|1912 |pp=284\u2013286}}\n\nThe Glencoe MacDonalds were one of three [[Lochaber]] clans with a reputation for lawlessness, the others being the [[MacGregors]] and the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Keppoch MacDonalds]]. Levies from these clans served in the Independent Companies used to suppress the [[Conventicle#Scotland|Conventicles]] in 1678\u201380, and took part in the devastating [[Atholl]] raid that followed [[Argyll's Rising]] in 1685.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} They also combined against their Maclean landlords in the August 1688 [[Battle of Maol Ruadh]], putting them in the unusual position of being considered outlaws by both the previous Jacobite administration and the new Williamite one.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=137}}\n\n== Oath of allegiance to William ==\n[[File:1stEarlOfStair.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Stair, Secretary of State for Scotland]]\nAfter [[Battle of Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]], the Scottish government held a series of meetings with the Jacobite chiefs, offering terms that varied based on events in Ireland and Scotland. In March 1690, the Secretary of State, [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]], offered a total of \u00a312,000 for swearing allegiance to William. They agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|the Earl of Breadalbane]] signing for the government; in July, the [[Battle of Aughrim]] ended [[Williamite War in Ireland|the War in Ireland]] and immediate prospects of a Restoration.\n[[File:Achallader Farm Tower - geograph.org.uk - 55403.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of [[Achallader Castle]], site of the meeting that led to the Declaration of June 1691]]\nOn 26 August, a Royal Proclamation offered a pardon to anyone taking the Oath prior to 1 January 1692, with severe reprisals for those who did not.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Two days later, secret articles appeared, cancelling the agreement in the event of a Jacobite invasion and signed by all the attendees, including Breadalbane.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=139}} Breadalbane claimed these were manufactured by Glengarry, the MacDonald chief; but Stair's letters reflect his belief that forged or not, none of the signatories intended to keep their word.<ref>Correspondence of Lord Stair; Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Enforcement became a key concern.\n\nIn early October, the chiefs asked James for permission to take the Oath unless he could mount an invasion before the deadline, a condition they knew to be impossible.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=45}} His approval was sent on 12 December and was received by Glengarry on the 23rd, but was not shared until the 28th. It is suggested delays were caused by intrigue between Catholic Jacobites, led by Glengarry, and the Protestant majority.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=30}}\n\nAs a result, MacIain of Glencoe only left for Fort William on 30 December to take the Oath from the governor, Lieutenant Colonel John Hill. Since he was not authorised to accept it, Hill sent MacIain to Inverary with a letter for the local magistrate, Sir Colin Campbell confirming his arrival before the deadline. Sir Colin administered the Oath on 6 January, after which MacIain returned home.{{sfn|Buchan|1933|p=59}} Glengarry did not swear until 4 February, with others doing so by proxy, but only MacIain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the Scottish Privy Council.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=140}}\n\nStair's letter of 2 December to Breadalbane shows the intention of making an example was taken well before the deadline for the Oath but as a much bigger operation; ''...the clan Donell must be rooted out and Lochiel. Leave the McLeans to Argyll...''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=94\u201396}} In January, he wrote three letters in quick succession to [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Sir Thomas Livingstone]], military commander in Scotland; on 7th, the intention was to ''....destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheal's lands, Kippochs, Glengarrie and Glenco...;'' on 9th ''...their chieftains all being '''papists''', it is well the vengeance falls there; for my part, I regret the MacDonalds had not divided and...'''Kippoch and Glenco are safe'''.'' The last on 11 January states; ''...my lord Argile tells me Glenco hath not taken the oaths at which I rejoice....''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=97\u2013100}}\n[[File:Invergarry Old Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1515750.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Glengarry's house; Invergarry Castle in 2009]]\nParliament passed a Decree of Forfeiture in 1690, depriving Glengarry of his lands, but he continued to hold [[Invergarry Castle]], whose garrison included the senior Jacobite officers [[Alexander Cannon]] and [[Thomas Buchan]]. This suggests the Episcopalian Glencoe MacDonalds only replaced the Catholic Glengarry as the target on 11 January; MacIain's son John MacDonald told the 1695 Commission the soldiers came to Glencoe from the north '...Glengarry's house being reduced.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |p=904}} \n\nAfter two years of negotiations, Stair was under pressure to ensure the deal stuck, while [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll|Argyll]] was competing for political influence with his kinsman Breadalbane, who also found it expedient to concur with the plan.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}} Glengarry was pardoned and his lands returned, while maintaining his reputation at the Jacobite court by being the last to swear and ensuring Cannon and Buchan received safe conduct to France in March 1692.{{sfn|MacConechy|1843|p=77}} In summary, the Glencoe MacDonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies.\n\n== Massacre ==\nIn late January 1692, two companies or approximately 120 men from [[Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot|the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot]] arrived in Glencoe from Invergarry. Their commander was Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, a local landowner whose niece was married to one of MacIain's sons.{{efn|As per John Prebble's account 'Glencoe; the Story of the Massacre,' this was John MacDonald, who served in the Jacobite force under Thomas Buchan scattered at Cromdale in May 1690.}} Campbell carried orders for 'free quarter', an established alternative to paying taxes in what was a largely non-cash society.{{sfn|Kennedy |2014 |p=141}} The Glencoe MacDonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the Campbells when serving with the Highland levies used to police [[Argyll]] in 1678.{{sfn|Lenman|1991|pp=238\u2013239}}\n\nHighland regiments were formed by first appointing Captains, each responsible for recruiting sixty men from his own estates. [[Muster rolls]] for the regiment from October 1691 show the vast majority came from Argyll, including [[Cowal]] and [[Kintyre]], areas settled by Lowlander migrants and badly hit by the Atholl raids of 1685 and 1686.{{sfn|Argyll Transcripts| 1891|pp=12\u201324}} \n\nOn 12 February, Hill issued orders instructing Hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from Glencoe at [[Kinlochleven]]. Another 400 men from Argyll's Regiment under [[Robert Duncanson (Army officer)|Major Duncanson]] would join Glenlyon's detachment in the south and sweep northwards up the glen, killing anyone they found, removing property and burning houses.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=538}} \n[[File:Glencoe Massacre Memorial.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Glencoe Massacre Memorial]]\nOn the evening of 12 February, Glenlyon received written orders from Duncanson carried by another Argyll officer, Captan Thomas Drummond; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out.\n''See that this be putt in execution without feud or favour, else you may expect to be dealt with as one not true to King nor Government, nor a man fitt to carry Commissione in the Kings service.'' As Captain of the Argylls' Grenadier company, Drummond was senior to Glenlyon; his presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced, since witnesses gave evidence he shot two people who asked Glenlyon for mercy.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=536}}\n\nMacIain was killed, but his two sons escaped and the 1695 Commission was given various figures for total deaths. The often quoted figure of 38 was based on hearsay evidence from Hamilton's men, while the MacDonalds claimed 'the number they knew to be slaine were about 25.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |pp=902\u2013903}} Recent estimates put total deaths resulting from the Massacre as 'around 30', while claims others died of exposure have not been substantiated.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campsie |first1=Alison |title=The Scotsman |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/archaeologists-trace-lost-settlements-of-glencoe-destroyed-after-1692-massacre-1-4687371 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Archaeologists trace lost settlements of Glencoe destroyed after 1692 massacre |date=12 February 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:GlencoeOrder.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Duncanson's written orders to Glenlyon{{efn|You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebells, the McDonalds of Glenco, and put all to the sword under seventy. you are to have a speciall care that the old Fox and his sones doe upon no account escape your hands, you are to secure all the avenues that no man escape.

Duncanson was two hours late, only joining Glenlyon at the southern end at 7:00 am, after which they advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock. Hamilton was not in position at Kinlochleven until 11:00; his detachment included two lieutenants, Francis Farquhar and Gilbert Kennedy who often appear in anecdotes claiming they 'broke their swords rather than carry out their orders.' This differs from their testimony to the Commission and is unlikely, since they arrived hours after the killings, which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen.{{sfn|Howell|2017|p=903}}\n\nIn his letters of 30 January to Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton and Colonel Hill, Stair expresses concern the MacDonalds would escape if warned, and emphasises the need for secrecy. This correlates with evidence from James Campbell, one of Glenlyon's company, stating they had no knowledge of the plan until the morning of 13 February.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=537}}\n\nIn May, fears of a French invasion meant the Argylls were posted to [[Brentford]] in England, then to Flanders, where they remained until the [[Nine Years' War]] ended in 1697 and the regiment was disbanded. No action was taken against those involved; Glenlyon died of disease in Bruges in August 1696, Duncanson became a Colonel and was killed fighting in Spain in May 1705, while Drummond featured in another famous Scottish disaster, the [[Darien scheme|Darien Scheme]].\n\n== Inquiry ==\nThe killings first came to public attention when a copy of Glenlyon's orders, alleged to have been left in an Edinburgh coffee house, was smuggled to France and published in the ''Paris Gazette'' of 12 April 1692.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=143}} Despite criticism of the Scottish government, there was little sympathy for the MacDonalds; the military commander in Scotland, [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Viscount Teviot]] wrote that 'it's not that anyone thinks the thieving tribe did not deserve to be destroyed but that it should have been done by those quartered amongst them makes a great noise.'{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=198}} The impetus behind an inquiry was political; as a member of James' administration, Stair was unpopular with Jacobites and supporters of the new regime.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}}\n[[File:Moord op de gebroeders De Witt, door Pieter Frits (1627-1708).jpg|thumb|left|240px|The killing of the De Witt brothers, The Hague 1672; the Massacre first appeared as a minor issue in a broadsheet accusing William of complicity in their murder]]\nVarious observers argued Glencoe showed the Highlands could not be controlled purely by force, including Colonel Hill, who was generally sympathetic towards Highlanders and claimed even in Lochaber, {{lang|sco|a single person may travell safley where he will witout harme.}} He argued lawlessness was deliberately encouraged by leaders like Glengarry but that \u2018the midle sort of Gentrey and Commons....never got anything but hurt\u2019 from it. The 1693 Highland Judicial Commission tried to solve this by making it easier to use the law to resolve minor issues like cattle-theft. As Hill predicted, it was undermined by the clan chiefs, since it diminished control over their tenants and clansmen.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201360}}\n\nIn 1695, the massacre was referenced in a pamphlet written by [[Charles Leslie (nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]], a [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] [[Church of Ireland]] Episcopalian priest who moved to London in 1690 and produced pro-Jacobite articles until his death in 1721.<ref>[https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/15541/1/frank%20william.pdf Charles Leslie & Theological Politics in Post Revolutionary England]; William Frank, B.A., Thesis for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy McMaster University February 1983</ref> This focused on was William's alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Dutch Republican leader [[Johan de Witt]], with the additions of Glencoe and a number of other crimes.<ref>[https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1692.html Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe], Gaffney,\u2019 Edinburgh, 1695</ref>\n\nA Parliamentary Commission was set up to determine whether there was a case to answer under the charge of 'Slaughter under trust.' This 1587 law was intended to reduce endemic feuding by requiring opponents to use the Crown to settle disputes and applied to murder committed in 'cold-blood', i.e., once articles of surrender had been agreed or hospitality accepted.{{sfn|Harris |2015 |pp=53\u201354}} This was subject to interpretation; in 1597, James MacDonald was charged under the law for assembling 200 men outside his parents' house, locking them inside and setting fire to it but this was later judged 'hot-blooded' and excluded.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} \n\nAs both a capital offence and treason, it was an awkward weapon with which to attack Stair, as William himself signed the orders and the intent was widely known in government circles. The Commission therefore focused on whether participants exceeded their orders, not their legality; it concluded Stair and Hamilton had a case to answer but left the decision to William. {{sfn|Somers|1843|p=545}} While Stair was dismissed as Secretary of State, he returned to government in 1700 and was made an earl by the last Stuart monarch, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=395}} An application by the surviving Glencoe MacDonalds for compensation was ignored; they rebuilt their houses and participated in both the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings.{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=214}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:McCulloch, Glencoe, Argyllshire.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Glencoe by Horatio McCulloch, 1864; a remote and empty landscape]]\nDespite its reputation, Glencoe was not particularly unusual; other examples involving the MacDonalds include the 1578 [[Battle of the Spoiling Dyke]] and the [[Battle_of_Dunaverty|Dunaverty]] Massacre in 1647. Breach of hospitality was less common, but far from unique; the charge of 'Slaughter under trust' was first used in 1588 to prosecute Lachlan Maclean, whose objections to his new stepfather, John MacDonald, resulted in the murder of 18 members of the MacDonald wedding party.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=129}} \n\nIts continuing significance derives from being used as a symbol of post-1688 oppression; in 1745, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles]] ordered Leslie's pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes to be reprinted in the Edinburgh ''Caledonian Mercury''.{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=1}} In 1859, it re-appeared{{cn|date=March 2020}} in [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|History]]''; he sought to exonerate William from every charge made by Leslie,{{primary-inline|date=March 2020}} including the Massacre, and this is the first recorded instance{{cn|date=March 2020}} of the claim it was part of a [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]\u2013MacDonald clan feud.{{sfn|Macaulay|1859|p=277}}\n[[File:Peter Graham - After the Massacre of Glencoe - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''After the Massacre of Glencoe'' by Peter Graham, 1889; the survivors seek refuge.]]\n[[Victorian_era|Victorian]] Scotland developed values that were pro-Union and pro-Empire, while also being uniquely Scottish.{{sfn|Morris|1992|pp=37\u201339}} Historical divisions meant this was largely expressed through a shared cultural identity, while the study of Scottish history itself virtually disappeared from universities.{{sfn|Kidd|1997|p=100}} Glencoe became part of a focus on 'the emotional trappings of the Scottish past...bonnie Scotland of the bens and glens and misty shieling, the Jacobites, Mary, Queen of Scots, tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary.'{{sfn |Ash|1980|p=10}} \n\nEven when Scottish history re-emerged in the 1950s, Leslie's perspectives continued to shape views of William's reign as particularly disastrous for Scotland. This meant Glencoe became part of a series of incidents, including the [[Darien scheme]], the famine of the late 1690s, and ultimately Union in 1707.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201333}} \n\nThe Massacre is the centre of an annual ceremony initiated in 1930 by Mary Rankin from Taigh a\u2019 phuirt, Glencoe, and continued by her family.<ref>''[[The Oban Times]]'', 22 February 1958.</ref> On 13 February each year the Clan Donald Society holds a wreath-laying ceremony attended by members from around the world at the Upper Carnoch memorial; this is a tapering Celtic cross designed in 1883 by MacDonald of Aberdeen and located at the eastern end of Glencoe village, formerly known as Carnoch.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/71831/ |title=Site Record for Glencoe, Massacre Of Glencoe Memorial; Macdonald's Monument; Glencoe Massacre |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=4 November 2013}}.

An estimated 30 members and associates of [[Clan MacDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by government forces billeted with them, on the grounds they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs, [[William III of England|William III of England and II of Scotland]] and [[Mary II]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}\nIn March 1689, [[James_II_of_England|James II of England and VII of Scotland]] landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his throne and [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, Viscount Dundee]], recruited a small force of [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] for a supporting campaign in Scotland. Despite victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] on 27 July, Dundee was killed, and organised Jacobite military resistance ended with defeats at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in August 1689 and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]] in May 1690.\n\nThe continuing need to police the Highlands used resources William needed for the [[Nine Years' War]]. A peaceful Scotland was important since links between Irish and Scottish branches of the MacDonalds, as well as Scottish and [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] Presbyterians, meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other.{{sfn|Lang|1912 |pp=284\u2013286}}\n\nThe Glencoe MacDonalds were one of three [[Lochaber]] clans with a reputation for lawlessness, the others being the [[MacGregors]] and the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Keppoch MacDonalds]]. Levies from these clans served in the Independent Companies used to suppress the [[Conventicle#Scotland|Conventicles]] in 1678\u201380, and took part in the devastating [[Atholl]] raid that followed [[Argyll's Rising]] in 1685.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} They also combined against their Maclean landlords in the August 1688 [[Battle of Maol Ruadh]], putting them in the unusual position of being considered outlaws by both the previous Jacobite administration and the new Williamite one.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=137}}\n\n== Oath of allegiance to William ==\n[[File:1stEarlOfStair.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Stair, Secretary of State for Scotland]]\nAfter [[Battle of Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]], the Scottish government held a series of meetings with the Jacobite chiefs, offering terms that varied based on events in Ireland and Scotland. In March 1690, the Secretary of State, [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]], offered a total of \u00a312,000 for swearing allegiance to William. They agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|the Earl of Breadalbane]] signing for the government; in July, the [[Battle of Aughrim]] ended [[Williamite War in Ireland|the War in Ireland]] and immediate prospects of a Restoration.\n[[File:Achallader Farm Tower - geograph.org.uk - 55403.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of [[Achallader Castle]], site of the meeting that led to the Declaration of June 1691]]\nOn 26 August, a Royal Proclamation offered a pardon to anyone taking the Oath prior to 1 January 1692, with severe reprisals for those who did not.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Two days later, secret articles appeared, cancelling the agreement in the event of a Jacobite invasion and signed by all the attendees, including Breadalbane.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=139}} Breadalbane claimed these were manufactured by Glengarry, the MacDonald chief; but Stair's letters reflect his belief that forged or not, none of the signatories intended to keep their word.<ref>Correspondence of Lord Stair; Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Enforcement became a key concern.\n\nIn early October, the chiefs asked James for permission to take the Oath unless he could mount an invasion before the deadline, a condition they knew to be impossible.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=45}} His approval was sent on 12 December and was received by Glengarry on the 23rd, but was not shared until the 28th. It is suggested delays were caused by intrigue between Catholic Jacobites, led by Glengarry, and the Protestant majority.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=30}}\n\nAs a result, MacIain of Glencoe only left for Fort William on 30 December to take the Oath from the governor, Lieutenant Colonel John Hill. Since he was not authorised to accept it, Hill sent MacIain to Inverary with a letter for the local magistrate, Sir Colin Campbell confirming his arrival before the deadline. Sir Colin administered the Oath on 6 January, after which MacIain returned home.{{sfn|Buchan|1933|p=59}} Glengarry did not swear until 4 February, with others doing so by proxy, but only MacIain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the Scottish Privy Council.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=140}}\n\nStair's letter of 2 December to Breadalbane shows the intention of making an example was taken well before the deadline for the Oath but as a much bigger operation; ''...the clan Donell must be rooted out and Lochiel. Leave the McLeans to Argyll...''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=94\u201396}} In January, he wrote three letters in quick succession to [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Sir Thomas Livingstone]], military commander in Scotland; on 7th, the intention was to ''....destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheal's lands, Kippochs, Glengarrie and Glenco...;'' on 9th ''...their chieftains all being '''papists''', it is well the vengeance falls there; for my part, I regret the MacDonalds had not divided and...'''Kippoch and Glenco are safe'''.'' The last on 11 January states; ''...my lord Argile tells me Glenco hath not taken the oaths at which I rejoice....''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=97\u2013100}}\n[[File:Invergarry Old Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1515750.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Glengarry's house; Invergarry Castle in 2009]]\nParliament passed a Decree of Forfeiture in 1690, depriving Glengarry of his lands, but he continued to hold [[Invergarry Castle]], whose garrison included the senior Jacobite officers [[Alexander Cannon]] and [[Thomas Buchan]]. This suggests the Episcopalian Glencoe MacDonalds only replaced the Catholic Glengarry as the target on 11 January; MacIain's son John MacDonald told the 1695 Commission the soldiers came to Glencoe from the north '...Glengarry's house being reduced.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |p=904}} \n\nAfter two years of negotiations, Stair was under pressure to ensure the deal stuck, while [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll|Argyll]] was competing for political influence with his kinsman Breadalbane, who also found it expedient to concur with the plan.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}} Glengarry was pardoned and his lands returned, while maintaining his reputation at the Jacobite court by being the last to swear and ensuring Cannon and Buchan received safe conduct to France in March 1692.{{sfn|MacConechy|1843|p=77}} In summary, the Glencoe MacDonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies.\n\n== Massacre ==\nIn late January 1692, two companies or approximately 120 men from [[Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot|the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot]] arrived in Glencoe from Invergarry. Their commander was Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, a local landowner whose niece was married to one of MacIain's sons.{{efn|As per John Prebble's account 'Glencoe; the Story of the Massacre,' this was John MacDonald, who served in the Jacobite force under Thomas Buchan scattered at Cromdale in May 1690.}} Campbell carried orders for 'free quarter', an established alternative to paying taxes in what was a largely non-cash society.{{sfn|Kennedy |2014 |p=141}} The Glencoe MacDonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the Campbells when serving with the Highland levies used to police [[Argyll]] in 1678.{{sfn|Lenman|1991|pp=238\u2013239}}\n\nHighland regiments were formed by first appointing Captains, each responsible for recruiting sixty men from his own estates. [[Muster rolls]] for the regiment from October 1691 show the vast majority came from Argyll, including [[Cowal]] and [[Kintyre]], areas settled by Lowlander migrants and badly hit by the Atholl raids of 1685 and 1686.{{sfn|Argyll Transcripts| 1891|pp=12\u201324}} \n\nOn 12 February, Hill issued orders instructing Hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from Glencoe at [[Kinlochleven]]. Another 400 men from Argyll's Regiment under [[Robert Duncanson (Army officer)|Major Duncanson]] would join Glenlyon's detachment in the south and sweep northwards up the glen, killing anyone they found, removing property and burning houses.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=538}} \n[[File:Glencoe Massacre Memorial.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Glencoe Massacre Memorial]]\nOn the evening of 12 February, Glenlyon received written orders from Duncanson carried by another Argyll officer, Captan Thomas Drummond; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out.\n''See that this be putt in execution without feud or favour, else you may expect to be dealt with as one not true to King nor Government, nor a man fitt to carry Commissione in the Kings service.'' As Captain of the Argylls' Grenadier company, Drummond was senior to Glenlyon; his presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced, since witnesses gave evidence he shot two people who asked Glenlyon for mercy.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=536}}\n\nMacIain was killed, but his two sons escaped and the 1695 Commission was given various figures for total deaths. The often quoted figure of 38 was based on hearsay evidence from Hamilton's men, while the MacDonalds claimed 'the number they knew to be slaine were about 25.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |pp=902\u2013903}} Recent estimates put total deaths resulting from the Massacre as 'around 30', while claims others died of exposure have not been substantiated.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campsie |first1=Alison |title=The Scotsman |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/archaeologists-trace-lost-settlements-of-glencoe-destroyed-after-1692-massacre-1-4687371 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Archaeologists trace lost settlements of Glencoe destroyed after 1692 massacre |date=12 February 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:GlencoeOrder.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Duncanson's written orders to Glenlyon{{efn|You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebells, the McDonalds of Glenco, and put all to the sword under seventy. you are to have a speciall care that the old Fox and his sones doe upon no account escape your hands, you are to secure all the avenues that no man escape.

Duncanson was two hours late, only joining Glenlyon at the southern end at 7:00 am, after which they advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock. Hamilton was not in position at Kinlochleven until 11:00; his detachment included two lieutenants, Francis Farquhar and Gilbert Kennedy who often appear in anecdotes claiming they 'broke their swords rather than carry out their orders.' This differs from their testimony to the Commission and is unlikely, since they arrived hours after the killings, which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen.{{sfn|Howell|2017|p=903}}\n\nIn his letters of 30 January to Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton and Colonel Hill, Stair expresses concern the MacDonalds would escape if warned, and emphasises the need for secrecy. This correlates with evidence from James Campbell, one of Glenlyon's company, stating they had no knowledge of the plan until the morning of 13 February.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=537}}\n\nIn May, fears of a French invasion meant the Argylls were posted to [[Brentford]] in England, then to Flanders, where they remained until the [[Nine Years' War]] ended in 1697 and the regiment was disbanded. No action was taken against those involved; Glenlyon died of disease in Bruges in August 1696, Duncanson became a Colonel and was killed fighting in Spain in May 1705, while Drummond featured in another famous Scottish disaster, the [[Darien scheme|Darien Scheme]].\n\n== Inquiry ==\nThe killings first came to public attention when a copy of Glenlyon's orders, alleged to have been left in an Edinburgh coffee house, was smuggled to France and published in the ''Paris Gazette'' of 12 April 1692.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=143}} Despite criticism of the Scottish government, there was little sympathy for the MacDonalds; the military commander in Scotland, [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Viscount Teviot]] wrote that 'it's not that anyone thinks the thieving tribe did not deserve to be destroyed but that it should have been done by those quartered amongst them makes a great noise.'{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=198}} The impetus behind an inquiry was political; as a member of James' administration, Stair was unpopular with Jacobites and supporters of the new regime.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}}\n[[File:Moord op de gebroeders De Witt, door Pieter Frits (1627-1708).jpg|thumb|left|240px|The killing of the De Witt brothers, The Hague 1672; the Massacre first appeared as a minor issue in a broadsheet accusing William of complicity in their murder]]\nVarious observers argued Glencoe showed the Highlands could not be controlled purely by force, including Colonel Hill, who was generally sympathetic towards Highlanders and claimed even in Lochaber, {{lang|sco|a single person may travell safley where he will witout harme.}} He argued lawlessness was deliberately encouraged by leaders like Glengarry but that \u2018the midle sort of Gentrey and Commons....never got anything but hurt\u2019 from it. The 1693 Highland Judicial Commission tried to solve this by making it easier to use the law to resolve minor issues like cattle-theft. As Hill predicted, it was undermined by the clan chiefs, since it diminished control over their tenants and clansmen.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201360}}\n\nIn 1695, the massacre was referenced in a pamphlet written by [[Charles Leslie (nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]], a [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] [[Church of Ireland]] Episcopalian priest who moved to London in 1690 and produced pro-Jacobite articles until his death in 1721.<ref>[https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/15541/1/frank%20william.pdf Charles Leslie & Theological Politics in Post Revolutionary England]; William Frank, B.A., Thesis for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy McMaster University February 1983</ref> This focused on was William's alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Dutch Republican leader [[Johan de Witt]], with the additions of Glencoe and a number of other crimes.<ref>[https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1692.html Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe], Gaffney,\u2019 Edinburgh, 1695</ref>\n\nA Parliamentary Commission was set up to determine whether there was a case to answer under the charge of 'Slaughter under trust.' This 1587 law was intended to reduce endemic feuding by requiring opponents to use the Crown to settle disputes and applied to murder committed in 'cold-blood', i.e., once articles of surrender had been agreed or hospitality accepted.{{sfn|Harris |2015 |pp=53\u201354}} This was subject to interpretation; in 1597, James MacDonald was charged under the law for assembling 200 men outside his parents' house, locking them inside and setting fire to it but this was later judged 'hot-blooded' and excluded.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} \n\nAs both a capital offence and treason, it was an awkward weapon with which to attack Stair, as William himself signed the orders and the intent was widely known in government circles. The Commission therefore focused on whether participants exceeded their orders, not their legality; it concluded Stair and Hamilton had a case to answer but left the decision to William. {{sfn|Somers|1843|p=545}} While Stair was dismissed as Secretary of State, he returned to government in 1700 and was made an earl by the last Stuart monarch, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=395}} An application by the surviving Glencoe MacDonalds for compensation was ignored; they rebuilt their houses and participated in both the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings.{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=214}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:McCulloch, Glencoe, Argyllshire.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Glencoe by Horatio McCulloch, 1864; a remote and empty landscape]]\nDespite its reputation, Glencoe was not particularly unusual; other examples involving the MacDonalds include the 1578 [[Battle of the Spoiling Dyke]] and the [[Battle_of_Dunaverty|Dunaverty]] Massacre in 1647. Breach of hospitality was less common, but far from unique; the charge of 'Slaughter under trust' was first used in 1588 to prosecute Lachlan Maclean, whose objections to his new stepfather, John MacDonald, resulted in the murder of 18 members of the MacDonald wedding party.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=129}} \n\nIts continuing significance derives from being used as a symbol of post-1688 oppression; in 1745, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles]] ordered Leslie's pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes to be reprinted in the Edinburgh ''Caledonian Mercury''.{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=1}} In 1859, it re-appeared{{cn|date=March 2020}} in [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|History]]''; he sought to exonerate William from every charge made by Leslie,{{primary-inline|date=March 2020}} including the Massacre, and this is the first recorded instance{{cn|date=March 2020}} of the claim it was part of a [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]\u2013MacDonald clan feud.{{sfn|Macaulay|1859|p=277}}\n[[File:Peter Graham - After the Massacre of Glencoe - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''After the Massacre of Glencoe'' by Peter Graham, 1889; the survivors seek refuge.]]\n[[Victorian_era|Victorian]] Scotland developed values that were pro-Union and pro-Empire, while also being uniquely Scottish.{{sfn|Morris|1992|pp=37\u201339}} Historical divisions meant this was largely expressed through a shared cultural identity, while the study of Scottish history itself virtually disappeared from universities.{{sfn|Kidd|1997|p=100}} Glencoe became part of a focus on 'the emotional trappings of the Scottish past...bonnie Scotland of the bens and glens and misty shieling, the Jacobites, Mary, Queen of Scots, tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary.'{{sfn |Ash|1980|p=10}} \n\nEven when Scottish history re-emerged in the 1950s, Leslie's perspectives continued to shape views of William's reign as particularly disastrous for Scotland. This meant Glencoe became part of a series of incidents, including the [[Darien scheme]], the famine of the late 1690s, and ultimately Union in 1707.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201333}} \n\nThe Massacre is the centre of an annual ceremony initiated in 1930 by Mary Rankin from Taigh a\u2019 phuirt, Glencoe, and continued by her family.<ref>''[[The Oban Times]]'', 22 February 1958.</ref> On 13 February each year the Clan Donald Society holds a wreath-laying ceremony attended by members from around the world at the Upper Carnoch memorial; this is a tapering Celtic cross designed in 1883 by MacDonald of Aberdeen and located at the eastern end of Glencoe village, formerly known as Carnoch.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/71831/ |title=Site Record for Glencoe, Massacre Of Glencoe Memorial; Macdonald's Monument; Glencoe Massacre |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=4 November 2013}}.

Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match with obnoxious arcade player Eddie \"Fireblaster\" Plant in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. A [[videocassette]] with footage of the event is included in a [[time capsule]] that is launched into space.\n\nIn the present day, Brenner has become an installer of [[Home cinema|home-theater systems]] while Cooper is the [[President of the United States]]. In [[Guam]], a [[Andersen Air Force Base|U.S. military base]] is attacked by [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s of ''[[Galaga]]'' that turn pieces of the base into small glowing cubes and one of the soldiers is abducted.\n\nBrenner works at the home of divorc\u00e9e and [[United States Navy|U.S. Army]] Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten, but the two are separately summoned to the [[White House]]. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, a friend he made at the video game tournament, Brenner determines the aliens have found the videocassette images to be a declaration of war and are attacking with a spacecraft resembling those of their classic video games. This is affirmed when the aliens (appearing as 1980s celebrities) interrupt a television broadcast, challenging Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three rounds, they will conquer Earth. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as ''[[Arkanoid]]'' paddles sling balls of light to destroy the [[Taj Mahal]], and another person is abducted.\n\nBrenner and Ludlow train [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] to play the old games. Violet develops light cannons that are effective against the aliens. In [[London]], the aliens (after declaring it as the \u201cWhere\u2019s The Beef?\u201d Lady) attack [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in the form of the video game ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', but as the soldiers are unable to beat them (as they forgot to shoot at the heads), Brenner and Ludlow step in and shoot them down. Following the victory, the aliens send congratulations and a \"[[Achievement (video gaming)|trophy]]\" in the form of the dog from ''[[Duck Hunt (video game)|Duck Hunt]]'' to an old woman (who appeared earlier at the London attack).\n\nLudlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie, who had been serving a prison sentence for fraud. In [[New York City]], the team discovers it must participate as the [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]] against [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]. [[Toru Iwatani]], the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', tries to confront him, but he gets his hand bitten off and flees. Using modified [[Mini Cooper]] cars, Brenner, Ludlow, and Eddie overcome the task, but Violet notices that something about Eddie is off, as he moved at supersonic speeds around the board. They win [[Q*Bert]] as a trophy. Later during a celebratory party however, the aliens (as [[Hall & Oates]]) declare that someone cheated and the challenge for the planet has been forfeited. Violet's son, Matty, discovers Eddie is the perpetrator, having used a [[Cheat codes|speed cheat]]. When the aliens' mothership suddenly appears, Eddie flees while Matty is abducted.\n\nThe aliens launch a massive attack using characters from all sorts of classic video games in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of Lady Lisa, a character on whom Ludlow had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lady Lisa to choose love, and she sides with the humans; Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight as well. Brenner, Violet, and Cooper are summoned to the mothership where they face the alien leader who takes the form of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] on the game's starting level with the aliens' captives at the top. As the group dodges barrels and fireballs, Brenner feels depressed and loses hope, until Matty reveals Eddie's cheating to him, thus restoring his confidence, and Brenner eventually throws a hammer to defeat Donkey Kong. The aliens' characters then self-destruct.\n\nThe team is hailed as heroes and a peace agreement is reached with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating in his life, and although Ludlow is saddened that Lady Lisa is gone, Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lady Lisa. Brenner and Violet become a couple while Eddie gets to meet [[Serena Williams]] and [[Martha Stewart]]. The aliens also restore Iwatani\u2019s hand before their departure. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow get married and have Q*Bert children.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As billed in the opening credits title cards -->\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Sam Brenner, a former 1980s ''[[Pac-Man]]'' video game champion, William's childhood best friend, and the leader of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Anthony Ippolito as 13-year-old Sam\n* [[Kevin James]] as President Will Cooper, the [[President of the United States]], Sam's childhood best friend, and a member of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jared Riley as 13-year-old Will\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten, a unique weapons developer and specialist for the military, a member of the team.<ref name=\"Michelle\"/>\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Eddie Plant, Sam's brash former video game-playing nemesis and a member of the team.<ref name=\"Peter\" /> The character's physical appearance and personality is styled after real-life [[Pac-Man]] and [[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]] disqualified champion [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=44358 |title=New Pixels Promo Arrives Online &#124; Movie News &#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/|title=Donkey Kong scoreboard strips Billy Mitchell\u2019s high score claims|date=2018-02-03|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref>\n** Andrew Bambridge as 13-year-old Eddie\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Ludlow Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed genius with poor social skills who is also a member of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jacob Shinder as 8-year-old Ludlow\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Admiral James Porter, a military heavyweight.<ref name=\"Cox\" />\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Corporal Hill\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as First Lady Jane Cooper, the [[First Lady of the United States]] and the wife of William.<ref name=\"Krakowski\" /><ref name=\"Krakowski\" />\n* [[Affion Crockett]] as Sergeant Dylan Cohan\n* [[Ashley Benson]] as Lady Lisa, a beautiful warrior from the fictional 1982 video game ''Dojo Quest''.<ref name=\"Benson\" />\n* [[Matt Lintz]] as Matty Van Patten\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Mickey Lamonsoff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/pixels-adam-sandler-sexism|title=Pixels and Adam Sandler Have Killed the Boys-Only Summer Blockbuster - Vanity Fair|author=Katey Rich|date=|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n<!-- that's it for the opening credits -->\n\n<!-- Celebrity cameos -->\n[[Dan Aykroyd]] plays the emcee of the 1982 video game championships.

[[Principal photography]] on the film began in May 28, 2014 in [[Toronto]] for three months.\n\nProduced by Columbus's [[1492 Pictures]] and Sandler's [[Happy Madison Productions]], ''Pixels'' was released theatrically by [[Columbia Pictures]]/[[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]] in the United States on July 24, 2015 in 2D, [[3-D film|3D]] and [[IMAX Corporation|IMAX 3D]] formats.

Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match with obnoxious arcade player Eddie \"Fireblaster\" Plant in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. A [[videocassette]] with footage of the event is included in a [[time capsule]] that is launched into space.\n\nIn the present day, Brenner has become an installer of [[Home cinema|home-theater systems]] while Cooper is the [[President of the United States]]. In [[Guam]], a [[Andersen Air Force Base|U.S. military base]] is attacked by [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s of ''[[Galaga]]'' that turn pieces of the base into small glowing cubes and one of the soldiers is abducted.\n\nBrenner works at the home of divorc\u00e9e and [[United States Navy|U.S. Army]] Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten, but the two are separately summoned to the [[White House]]. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, a friend he made at the video game tournament, Brenner determines the aliens have found the videocassette images to be a declaration of war and are attacking with a spacecraft resembling those of their classic video games. This is affirmed when the aliens (appearing as 1980s celebrities) interrupt a television broadcast, challenging Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three rounds, they will conquer Earth. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as ''[[Arkanoid]]'' paddles sling balls of light to destroy the [[Taj Mahal]], and another person is abducted.\n\nBrenner and Ludlow train [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] to play the old games. Violet develops light cannons that are effective against the aliens. In [[London]], the aliens (after declaring it as the \u201cWhere\u2019s The Beef?\u201d Lady) attack [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in the form of the video game ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', but as the soldiers are unable to beat them (as they forgot to shoot at the heads), Brenner and Ludlow step in and shoot them down. Following the victory, the aliens send congratulations and a \"[[Achievement (video gaming)|trophy]]\" in the form of the dog from ''[[Duck Hunt (video game)|Duck Hunt]]'' to an old woman (who appeared earlier at the London attack).\n\nLudlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie, who had been serving a prison sentence for fraud. In [[New York City]], the team discovers it must participate as the [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]] against [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]. [[Toru Iwatani]], the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', tries to confront him, but he gets his hand bitten off and flees. Using modified [[Mini Cooper]] cars, Brenner, Ludlow, and Eddie overcome the task, but Violet notices that something about Eddie is off, as he moved at supersonic speeds around the board. They win [[Q*Bert]] as a trophy. Later during a celebratory party however, the aliens (as [[Hall & Oates]]) declare that someone cheated and the challenge for the planet has been forfeited. Violet's son, Matty, discovers Eddie is the perpetrator, having used a [[Cheat codes|speed cheat]]. When the aliens' mothership suddenly appears, Eddie flees while Matty is abducted.\n\nThe aliens launch a massive attack using characters from all sorts of classic video games in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of Lady Lisa, a character on whom Ludlow had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lady Lisa to choose love, and she sides with the humans; Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight as well. Brenner, Violet, and Cooper are summoned to the mothership where they face the alien leader who takes the form of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] on the game's starting level with the aliens' captives at the top. As the group dodges barrels and fireballs, Brenner feels depressed and loses hope, until Matty reveals Eddie's cheating to him, thus restoring his confidence, and Brenner eventually throws a hammer to defeat Donkey Kong. The aliens' characters then self-destruct.\n\nThe team is hailed as heroes and a peace agreement is reached with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating in his life, and although Ludlow is saddened that Lady Lisa is gone, Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lady Lisa. Brenner and Violet become a couple while Eddie gets to meet [[Serena Williams]] and [[Martha Stewart]]. The aliens also restore Iwatani\u2019s hand before their departure. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow get married and have Q*Bert children.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As billed in the opening credits title cards -->\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Sam Brenner, a former 1980s ''[[Pac-Man]]'' video game champion, William's childhood best friend, and the leader of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Anthony Ippolito as 13-year-old Sam\n* [[Kevin James]] as President Will Cooper, the [[President of the United States]], Sam's childhood best friend, and a member of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jared Riley as 13-year-old Will\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten, a unique weapons developer and specialist for the military, a member of the team.<ref name=\"Michelle\"/>\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Eddie Plant, Sam's brash former video game-playing nemesis and a member of the team.<ref name=\"Peter\" /> The character's physical appearance and personality is styled after real-life [[Pac-Man]] and [[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]] disqualified champion [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=44358 |title=New Pixels Promo Arrives Online &#124; Movie News &#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/donkey-kong-scoreboard-strips-billy-mitchells-high-score-claims/|title=Donkey Kong scoreboard strips Billy Mitchell\u2019s high score claims|date=2018-02-03|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref>\n** Andrew Bambridge as 13-year-old Eddie\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Ludlow Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed genius with poor social skills who is also a member of the team.<ref name=\"Adam\"/>\n** Jacob Shinder as 8-year-old Ludlow\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Admiral James Porter, a military heavyweight.<ref name=\"Cox\" />\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Corporal Hill\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as First Lady Jane Cooper, the [[First Lady of the United States]] and the wife of William.<ref name=\"Krakowski\" /><ref name=\"Krakowski\" />\n* [[Affion Crockett]] as Sergeant Dylan Cohan\n* [[Ashley Benson]] as Lady Lisa, a beautiful warrior from the fictional 1982 video game ''Dojo Quest''.<ref name=\"Benson\" />\n* [[Matt Lintz]] as Matty Van Patten\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Mickey Lamonsoff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/pixels-adam-sandler-sexism|title=Pixels and Adam Sandler Have Killed the Boys-Only Summer Blockbuster - Vanity Fair|author=Katey Rich|date=|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n<!-- that's it for the opening credits -->\n\n<!-- Celebrity cameos -->\n[[Dan Aykroyd]] plays the emcee of the 1982 video game championships.

{"title_page": "Identified patient", "text_new": "'''Identified patient''' ('''IP''') is a clinical term often heard in family therapy discussion.  It describes one family member in a [[dysfunctional family]] who expresses the family's authentic inner conflicts.  Usually the \"designated patient\" expresses their physical symptoms unconsciously, unaware they are making overt, dysfunctional family dynamics, which have been covert and no one can talk about at home.  Occasionally the identified patient is partly conscious of why and how they have become the focus of concern in the family system. \n\nAs a family systems dynamic, the overt symptoms of identified patient draw attention away from the \"elephants in the living room no one can talk about\" which need to be discussed, such as a pending separation or divorce.  If covert abuse occurs between family members, the overt symptoms can draw attention away from  the perpetrator(s). \n\nThe identified patient is a kind of diversion and a kind of scapegoat.

He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving for his holiday, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\".<ref name=Brown>Brown, K.

Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating ''Penicillium'' was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming's trials occasionally showed more promise,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=Peter|title=Keith Bernard Rogers|journal=BMJ|date=10 September 2010|quote=Keith was probably the first patient to be treated clinically with the mould juice.|pmc=1200632|page=579|volume=331|issue=7516|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7516.579-c }}</ref> but Fleming largely abandoned penicillin work, leaving [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in Oxford to take up research to mass-produce it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments.<ref>Bickel, L.

When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked \"Good God! I thought he was dead.\"\n\n[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.\n\nAfter the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.\n\nFleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the \"Fleming Myth\" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir [[Henry Harris (scientist)|Henry Harris]] said in 1998: \"Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.\"<ref>Henry Harris, ''Howard Florey and the development of penicillin'', a lecture given on 29 September 1998, at the Florey Centenary, 1898\u20131998, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University (sound recording) [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1610017]</ref>\n\n===Antibiotics===\n[[File:Staphylococcus aureus (AB Test).jpg|right|thumb|Modern antibiotics are tested using a method similar to Fleming's discovery.]]\nFleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern [[antibiotics]]. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or ''Penicillium sp.'' were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals.

Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale.<ref name=\"shea\">Infection Control And Hospital Epidemiology.

[[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out&nbsp;... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted.\"<ref name=\"shea\"/> He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n==Myths==\nThe popular story<ref>e.g., ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2</ref> of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false. According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter<ref>14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2</ref> to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,<ref>see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920</ref> described this as \"A wondrous fable.\" Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]. Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in Tunisia in 1943. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by [[May & Baker]] Ltd, [[Dagenham]], Essex \u2013 a subsidiary of the French group [[Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc]]. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as \"This admirable M&B\".<ref>A History of May & Baker 1834\u20131984, Alden Press 1984.</ref> It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory [[Bayer]], and as Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n[[File:Flemingawardsnationalmuseumofscotland.jpg|thumb|right|Display of Fleming's awards, including his Nobel Prize.

He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy.

Before leaving for his holiday, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\".<ref name=Brown>Brown, K.

Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively.

Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin.<ref>in October 1943 Abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, the \u03b2-lactam ring, not then known in natural products. This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy, and was initially strongly disputed, by Sir Robert Robinson among others, but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X-ray analysis.\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; \"Abraham, Sir Edward Penley\"</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-edward-abraham-1093226.html|location=London|work=The Independent |first=Gordon|last=Lowe|title=Obituary: Sir Edward Abraham|date=13 May 1999}}</ref> Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned [[Howard Florey]], Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked \"Good God! I thought he was dead.\"\n\n[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.\n\nAfter the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.\n\nFleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the \"Fleming Myth\" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir [[Henry Harris (scientist)|Henry Harris]] said in 1998: \"Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.\"<ref>Henry Harris, ''Howard Florey and the development of penicillin'', a lecture given on 29 September 1998, at the Florey Centenary, 1898\u20131998, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University (sound recording) [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1610017]</ref>\n\n===Antibiotics===\n[[File:Staphylococcus aureus (AB Test).jpg|right|thumb|Modern antibiotics are tested using a method similar to Fleming's discovery.]]\nFleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern [[antibiotics]]. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or ''Penicillium sp.'' were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals. [[Ernest Duchesne]] in 1897 in his thesis \"Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes\",<ref name=\"Duchesne 1897\">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between molds and bacteria.

Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale.<ref name=\"shea\">Infection Control And Hospital Epidemiology.

[[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out&nbsp;... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted.\"<ref name=\"shea\"/> He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n==Myths==\nThe popular story<ref>e.g., ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2</ref> of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false. According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter<ref>14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2</ref> to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,<ref>see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920</ref> described this as \"A wondrous fable.\" Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]. Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in Tunisia in 1943. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by [[May & Baker]] Ltd, [[Dagenham]], Essex \u2013 a subsidiary of the French group [[Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc]]. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as \"This admirable M&B\".<ref>A History of May & Baker 1834\u20131984, Alden Press 1984.</ref> It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory [[Bayer]], and as Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n[[File:Flemingawardsnationalmuseumofscotland.jpg|thumb|right|Display of Fleming's awards, including his Nobel Prize.

Also in the cast are [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Richard Benjamin]], [[Eddie Albert]], Scott Elliott, [[Cathryn Damon]], and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' co-star [[Garrett Morris]]. The film was released in summer of 1980, grossing approximately US$7.5 million.\n\nThis was the final [[American International Pictures]] production before its merger with [[Filmways]].\n\n==Plot==\nJane ([[Susan Saint James]]), Elaine ([[Jane Curtin]]), and Louise ([[Jessica Lange]]) are suburbanites in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. These three women, friends since high school, are currently all struggling with money.\n\nJane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert ([[Fred Willard]]), her newly single father ([[Eddie Albert]]), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. Jane learns she is pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and Jane are nearly broke.\n\nElaine's husband, an architect, has left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and lots of bills, all of which are very overdue, leading to a scene with a man at the power company ([[Garrett Morris]]). Depressed, she gets drunk and her car is pulled over by police officer Jack ([[Dabney Coleman]]). Elaine makes a pass at him, trying to get out of the ticket. When he accepts, then reveals he is married, Elaine smacks him with her purse. She makes it clear that if she is arrested by Jack, her one phone call will be to his wife.\n\nLouise owns an antiques store. Unfortunately, it is not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband ([[Richard Benjamin]]) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred.\n\nThe women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. With nowhere else to turn, Jane, Elaine and Louise notice a \"money ball\" at the mall, filled with cash, and hatch a scheme to pull off a daring robbery by land and by sea.\n\nAt the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance ([[Cathryn Damon]]) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \"give away\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall.\n\nDespite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd.\n\nAn indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away.\n\nHours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket.

Also in the cast are [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Richard Benjamin]], [[Eddie Albert]], Scott Elliott, [[Cathryn Damon]], and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' co-star [[Garrett Morris]]. The film was released in summer of 1980, grossing approximately US $7.5 million.\n\nThis was the final [[American International Pictures]] production before its merger with [[Filmways]].\n\n==Plot==\nJane ([[Susan Saint James]]), Elaine ([[Jane Curtin]]), and Louise ([[Jessica Lange]]) are suburbanites in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. These three women, friends since high school, are currently all struggling with money.\n\nJane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert ([[Fred Willard]]), her newly single father ([[Eddie Albert]]), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. Jane learns she is pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and Jane are nearly broke.\n\nElaine's husband, an architect, has left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and lots of bills, all of which are very overdue, leading to a scene with a man at the power company ([[Garrett Morris]]). Depressed, she gets drunk and her car is pulled over by police officer Jack ([[Dabney Coleman]]). Elaine makes a pass at him, trying to get out of the ticket. When he accepts, then reveals he is married, Elaine smacks him with her purse. She makes it clear that if she is arrested by Jack, her one phone call will be to his wife.\n\nLouise owns an antiques store. Unfortunately, it is not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband ([[Richard Benjamin]]) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred.\n\nThe women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. With nowhere else to turn, Jane, Elaine and Louise notice a \"money ball\" at the mall, filled with cash, and hatch a scheme to pull off a daring robbery by land and by sea.\n\nAt the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance ([[Cathryn Damon]]) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \"give away\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall.\n\nDespite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd.\n\nAn indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away.\n\nHours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket. The three begin to argue, but Louise notices a bag floating by and all three of them dive in after it.\n\nAt the film's end, Jane has married Robert and gotten her father a condo in a senior's complex; Louise reopens her store and takes back her husband, whom she had left; and Elaine begins dating the officer, with enough secret money to bring her back to the lifestyle she had been accustomed to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Susan Saint James]] as Jane\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Elaine\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Louise\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Jack Heintzel\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Albert\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Robert\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Max\n* [[Cathryn Damon]] as Natalie\n}}\n\n==Production==\nRobert Kaufman had written the script in 1971-1972,<ref name=kramerL-1979-08-23>{{citation |author=Kramer, Linda |title=Another Big Scene In Eugene |publisher=Associated Press |journal=Eugene Register-Guard |date=August 23, 1979 }}</ref> and Kaufman (and then later with Jere Henshaw) had [[20th Century Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Universal Pictures]], all interested in the project if he could land major stars.

{"title_page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "text_new": "{{Short description|Proposed theories of gravity}}\n\n{{disputed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Alternatives to general relativity''' are [[Physical theory|physical theories]] that attempt to describe the phenomenon of [[gravitation]] in competition to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | authorlink = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559\u2013574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Lorentz-invariant models (1905\u20131910)===\nBased on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

Discarding the Minkowski metric entirely, Einstein gets:\n\n:<math>\\delta \\int ds = 0 \\,</math>\n\n:<math>{ds}^2 = g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac {1}{2} g_{\\mu \\nu}T \\right) \\,</math>\n\nwhich can also be written\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu} = {c^4 \\over 8 \\pi G} \\left( R^{\\mu \\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu \\nu} R \\right) \\,.</math>\n\nFive days before Einstein presented the last equation above, Hilbert had submitted a paper containing an almost identical equation. See [[relativity priority dispute]]. Hilbert was the first to correctly state the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] for general relativity, which is:\n\n:<math>S = {c^4 \\over 16 \\pi G} \\int R \\sqrt{-g} \\ d^4 x + S_m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>G \\,</math> is Newton's gravitational constant, <math>R = R_{\\mu}^{~\\mu} \\,</math> is the [[Ricci curvature]] of space, <math>g = \\det ( g_{\\mu \\nu} ) \\,</math> and <math>S_m \\,</math> is the [[action (physics)|action]] due to mass.\n\nGeneral relativity is a tensor theory, the equations all contain tensors. Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

Their constraint is eight orders of magnitude sharper than previous estimates.\n\nMoffat's<ref name=Moffat2005 /> metric-skew-tensor-gravity (MSTG) theory is able to predict rotation curves for galaxies without either dark matter or MOND, and claims that it can also explain gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters without dark matter. It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields. But the equations are quite straightforward. The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant. The functions assumed for the scalar potentials are not stated.\n\n=== Infinite derivative gravity ===\n{{main|Infinite derivative gravity}}\nIn order to remove ghosts in the modified propagator, as well as to obtain asymptotic freedom, Biswas, [[Anupam Mazumdar|Mazumdar]] and [[Warren Siegel|Siegel]] (2005) considered a string-inspired infinite set of higher derivative terms\n:<math>S = \\int \\mathrm{d}^4x  \\sqrt{-g} \\left(\\frac{R}{2} + R F (\\Box) R \\right)</math>\nwhere <math> F (\\Box)</math> is the exponential of an entire function of the [[d'Alembert operator|D'Alembertian operator]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bouncing Universes in String-inspired Gravity|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2006|issue=3|pages=009|arxiv=hep-th/0508194|bibcode = 2006JCAP...03..009B |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2006/03/009 |year=2006|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Anupam|last3=Siegel|first3=Warren}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1308.2319 |title=Generalized ghost-free quadratic curvature gravity|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=31|issue=1|pages=015022|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Conroy|first2=Aindri\u00fa|last3= Koshelev|first3=Alexey S.|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2013|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/31/1/015022|bibcode = 2014CQGra..31a5022B }}</ref> This avoids a black hole singularity near the origin, while recovering the 1/r fall of the general relativity potential at large distances.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1110.5249|title=Towards singularity and ghost free theories of gravity|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=108|issue=3|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Gerwick|first2=Erik|last3=Koivisto|first3=Tomi|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2011|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.031101|bibcode=2012PhRvL.108c1101B|pmid=22400725|page=031101}}</ref> [[Carlos Lousto|Lousto]] and Mazzitelli (1997) found an exact solution to this theories representing a gravitational shock-wave.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.56.3471|title=Exact self-consistent gravitational shock wave in semiclassical gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=56|issue=6|pages=3471\u20133477|year=1997|last1=Lousto|first1=Carlos O|last2=Mazzitelli|first2=Francisco D|bibcode=1997PhRvD..56.3471L|arxiv=gr-qc/9611009}}</ref>\n\n== Testing of alternatives to general relativity ==\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nAny putative alternative to general relativity would need to meet a variety of tests for it to become accepted.  For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G.

In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in free space but varies in the presence of matter.

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.
