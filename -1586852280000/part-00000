The band made two trips to the UK, but were not so successful there. After the band split in 1971, Parry returned to England and spent two years obtaining a diploma in marketing and advertising from the [[College for Distributive Trades]] in London.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=|pp=59\u201360}}<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2018691244/new-zealander-chris-parry-on-managing-the-cure|title=New Zealander Chris Parry on managing The Cure|date=2019-04-16|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> He then found a job in the International department at [[Phonogram Records]], under fellow New Zealander [[John McCready]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1974, Parry was offered a job at [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] in [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]].

His requests to Polydor in 1976 to sign the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]] were rejected.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=|pp=60\u201361}} However, in January 1977, he got a tip from future-[[The Pogues|Pogues]] frontman [[Shane MacGowan]] to check out [[the Jam]]. Parry was convinced and signed them to Polydor in February. He also co-produced the Jam's first three albums as well as the only album by t[[The Jolt|he Jolt]] who he also signed.

He listened to a demo tape by [[the Cure]] and was particularly impressed with \"[[10:15 Saturday Night]]\" and also \"[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure song)|Boys Don't Cry]]\". He called them up and a meeting was arranged for August at Polydor's office in [[Stratford Place]]. After the meeting, [[Robert Smith (singer)|Robert Smith]] invited Parry to watch them perform at the Laker's Hotel in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] on 27 August. After the gig, Parry invited them to a drink at a nearby pub, The Home Cottage, at which he told the Cure he wanted them to be his first signing, which they agreed to and they officially signed in September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/cure-ail-ail-rocknroll-alt-pops-aid-relief|title=Searching For The Cure - Record Collector Magazine|website=recordcollectormag.com|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Soon after, Parry signed [[Billy Mackenzie|Billy MacKenzie]] and [[Alan Rankine]], who went on to form [[The Associates (band)|the Associates]].{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=68}} Along with engineer [[Mike Hedges]], Parry then recorded the Cure's first album ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' at [[Morgan Studios]], which was released in May 1979.

In a recipe adapted for the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]], [[walnuts]] were recommended.<ref name=serventi235/>\n\nThe traditional lasagne of Naples, ''lasagne di carnevale'', are layered with local [[sausage]], small fried [[meatballs]], [[hard-boiled eggs]], [[ricotta]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses, and sauced with a [[Neapolitan rag\u00f9]], a meat sauce.<ref name=\"delconte\">{{cite book |last=Del Conte |first=Anna |title=Gastronomy of Italy |date=December 1, 2013 |isbn=978-1862059580 |publisher=Pavilion }}</ref> ''Lasagne al forno'', layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, [[tomato sauce]], meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with [[wine]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[oregano]]. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked ([[al forno]]).\n\nTraditionally, pasta dough prepared in [[Southern Italy]] used [[semolina]] and water; in the [[Northern Italy|northern regions]], where semolina was not available, [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is [[durum wheat]], commercial lasagne are made of semolina from durum wheat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree 187 |url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf |publisher=translation from UA A.F.P.A |accessdate=7 October 2012 |date=9 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and especially in its capital, [[Bologna]], layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables in the dough) and served with [[rag\u00f9 alla bolognese|rag\u00f9]] (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Regional Italian cuisine: typical recipes and culinary impressions from all regions|last=Hess|first=Reinhardt|last2=S\u00e4lzer|first2=Sabine|publisher=Barron's|year=1999|isbn=9780764151590|location=|pages=|oclc=42786762}}</ref><ref>Root, Waverley.
