The album was initially set to be released in March 2006, but was postponed as a result of guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]'s stroke, the loss of the band's former manager, and [[Will Boyd]]'s and [[Ben Moody]]'s [[resignation]] from the group. The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including [[gothic rock]]<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and [[symphonic metal]],<ref name=\"smh\"/> as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by [[Amy Lee]] and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by [[Dave Fortman]].\n\n''The Open Door'' received mixed to positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who generally praised its lyrical content and the instrumentation accompanied by Lee's vocals. Some critics gave negative reviews regarding the band's sound, which differs from that of the band's previous album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'' (2003). The record was nominated at the [[50th Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] for \"[[Sweet Sacrifice]]\". The band also won in the category of [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards#Award categories|Album of the Year]] at the 2007 [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards]]. ''The Open Door'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling more than 447,000 copies in its first week. It topped the charts in Australia, Europe, Germany, Greece and Switzerland, and reached the top five in over 15 countries. The album was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) just over a month after its release, and has since been certified double platinum. The record has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"[[Call Me When You're Sober]]\" was released digitally as the album's lead single on September 14, 2006. It peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and charted in the top 20 of several charts internationally. \"[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]\" was released as the second single on January 1, 2007, and \"Sweet Sacrifice\" was released as the third international single from the album on May 5, 2007. \"[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]\" was scheduled to be released on December 14, 2007, but was ultimately cancelled. ''The Open Door'' was supported by two worldwide tours, [[The Open Door Tour]] and the [[Evanescence Tour]].\n\n==Background, title and artwork==\n{{quote box|width=25%|quote=\"I feel like with ''Fallen'', a lot of those songs sound like I was trying to prove myself and establish what we were and our sound. I was trapped having to feel a certain way. But with the new record, I sort of went with everything. I am not afraid to feel happy sometimes, and I think there's moments on the album with sensuality, which is really fun and beautiful, instead of the last time, where I felt like I was only getting out part of me. This record embraces the whole me.\"|source= \u2014 Amy Lee talking about ''The Open Door'' with [[MTV News]].<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" />}}\n\nDuring an interview with MTV News, Lee revealed that Evanescence would being writing material for their sophomore record in March 2004 after finishing their tour in support of ''Fallen''. She further explained it was impossible to write on tour and that \"everybody's going to go to their house and write material\".<ref name=\"mtv1483876\" /> While saying the group would assemble to record new material,<ref name=\"mtv1483876\" /> Lee announced the release of ''The Open Door'' to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com.<ref name=\"VH1losebass\" /> The album progressed slowly because of Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]'s stroke, [[Will Boyd]]'s and [[Ben Moody]]'s departure, and the loss of their former manager.<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" /><ref name=\"jamclasic\" /> Lee said on a fan's internet forum the new recording would be completed in March 2006; the release was postponed because \"Wind-up Records&nbsp;...&nbsp;wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single \"[[Call Me When You're Sober]]\".<ref name=\"Evboardlovealbum\" /> Talking about the development and inspiration of the album, the singer stated:\n<blockquote>\nAll the things that happened were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, because you have passion\u2014even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked whether the album was thematically different from ''Fallen'', Lee said that \"all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences\" that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in \"the hard stuff\", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness.<ref name=\"billinterview\" /> In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I have the ability to do a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons...&nbsp;...&nbsp;A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life\u2014not just since everything has happened for us.<ref name=\"bigbadwolf\" /> The singer also felt the band \"broke the doors\" and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Dane Prokofiev of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the album cover, calling it \"[a] gother-looking piece.\"<ref name=\"Prokofiev\" />\n\n==Writing and recording==\n''The Open Door'' took 18 months to write. The new songs were written by Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs.<ref name=\"Richard 2006\" /> Lee was the sole writer of \"Like You\", \"[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]\" and \"[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]\", and co-wrote \"All That I'm Living For\" with guitarist John LeCompt.<ref name=\"Cre\" /> The singer confessed that after Moody's departure she had nobody to hold her back in the writing process and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, \"He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with.\"<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" /><ref name=\"mtv1493917\" /> Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was \"really intense\" and that she came out \"feeling purified\" while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her \"to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities\".<ref name=\"bill1005399242\" /> She said it was only about \"writing great music\".<ref name=\"billinterview\" />\n\nThe album was recorded at [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studios]], Los Angeles, California,<ref name=\"Cre\" /> and was produced and mixed by [[Dave Fortman]] at [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]]. Jeremy Parker handled the [[audio engineer]]ing, Mike Houge and Wesley Seidman served as additional engineers, and [[Ted Jensen]] [[Audio mastering|mastered]] the record at Sterling Sound, New York.<ref name=\"Cre\" /> The choral arrangements were finished by Lee and recorded at [[Capitol Studios]], Hollywood, California, with the choir and strings being recorded in an old chapel near Seattle, Washington.<ref name=\"Cre\" /><ref name=\"nme23736\" /> [[DJ Lethal]] [[Programming (music)|programmed]] every song on the album, and John LeCompt was an additional programmer on \"Call Me When You're Sober\" and \"All That I'm Living For\", which was also programmed by [[Bon Harris]].

At the heart of it I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went a lot of different ways with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine.

The album was initially set to be released in March 2006, but was postponed as a result of guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]'s stroke, the loss of the band's former manager, and [[Will Boyd]]'s and [[Ben Moody]]'s [[resignation]] from the group. The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including [[gothic rock]]<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and [[symphonic metal]],<ref name=\"smh\"/> as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by [[Amy Lee]] and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by [[Dave Fortman]].\n\n''The Open Door'' received mixed to positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who generally praised its lyrical content and the instrumentation accompanied by Lee's vocals. Some critics gave negative reviews regarding the band's sound, which differs from that of the band's previous album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'' (2003). The record was nominated at the [[50th Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] for \"[[Sweet Sacrifice]]\". The band also won in the category of [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards#Award categories|Album of the Year]] at the 2007 [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards]]. ''The Open Door'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling more than 447,000 copies in its first week. It topped the charts in Australia, Europe, Germany, Greece and Switzerland, and reached the top five in over 15 countries. The album was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) just over a month after its release, and has since been certified double platinum. The record has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"[[Call Me When You're Sober]]\" was released digitally as the album's lead single on September 14, 2006. It peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and charted in the top 20 of several charts internationally. \"[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]\" was released as the second single on January 1, 2007, and \"Sweet Sacrifice\" was released as the third international single from the album on May 5, 2007. \"[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]\" was scheduled to be released on December 14, 2007, but was ultimately cancelled. ''The Open Door'' was supported by two worldwide tours, [[The Open Door Tour]] and the [[Evanescence Tour]].\n\n==Background, title and artwork==\n{{quote box|width=25%|quote=\"I feel like with ''Fallen'', a lot of those songs sound like I was trying to prove myself and establish what we were and our sound. I was trapped having to feel a certain way. But with the new record, I sort of went with everything. I am not afraid to feel happy sometimes, and I think there's moments on the album with sensuality, which is really fun and beautiful, instead of the last time, where I felt like I was only getting out part of me. This record embraces the whole me.\"|source= \u2014 Amy Lee talking about ''The Open Door'' with [[MTV News]].<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" />}}\n\nDuring an interview with MTV News, Lee revealed that Evanescence would being writing material for their sophomore record in March 2004 after finishing their tour in support of ''Fallen''. She further explained it was impossible to write on tour and that \"everybody's going to go to their house and write material\".<ref name=\"mtv1483876\" /> While saying the group would assemble to record new material,<ref name=\"mtv1483876\" /> Lee announced the release of ''The Open Door'' to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com.<ref name=\"VH1losebass\" /> The album progressed slowly because of Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]'s stroke, [[Will Boyd]]'s and [[Ben Moody]]'s departure, and the loss of their former manager.<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" /><ref name=\"jamclasic\" /> Lee said on a fan's internet forum the new recording would be completed in March 2006; the release was postponed because \"Wind-up Records&nbsp;...&nbsp;wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single \"[[Call Me When You're Sober]]\".<ref name=\"Evboardlovealbum\" /> Talking about the development and inspiration of the album, the singer stated:\n<blockquote>\nAll the things that happened were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, because you have passion\u2014even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked whether the album was thematically different from ''Fallen'', Lee said that \"all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences\" that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in \"the hard stuff\", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness.<ref name=\"billinterview\" /> In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I have the ability to do a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons...&nbsp;...&nbsp;A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life\u2014not just since everything has happened for us.<ref name=\"bigbadwolf\" /> The singer also felt the band \"broke the doors\" and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Dane Prokofiev of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the album cover, calling it \"[a] gother-looking piece.\"<ref name=\"Prokofiev\" />\n\n==Writing and recording==\n''The Open Door'' took 18 months to write. The new songs were written by Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs.<ref name=\"Richard 2006\" /> Lee was the sole writer of \"Like You\", \"[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]\" and \"[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]\", and co-wrote \"All That I'm Living For\" with guitarist John LeCompt.<ref name=\"Cre\" /> The singer confessed that after Moody's departure she had nobody to hold her back in the writing process and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, \"He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with.\"<ref name=\"mtv1529541\" /><ref name=\"mtv1493917\" /> Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was \"really intense\" and that she came out \"feeling purified\" while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her \"to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities\".<ref name=\"bill1005399242\" /> She said it was only about \"writing great music\".<ref name=\"billinterview\" />\n\nThe album was recorded at [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studios]], Los Angeles, California,<ref name=\"Cre\" /> and was produced and mixed by [[Dave Fortman]] at [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]]. Jeremy Parker handled the [[audio engineer]]ing, Mike Houge and Wesley Seidman served as additional engineers, and [[Ted Jensen]] [[Audio mastering|mastered]] the record at Sterling Sound, New York.<ref name=\"Cre\" /> The choral arrangements were finished by Lee and recorded at [[Capitol Studios]], Hollywood, California, with the choir and strings being recorded in an old chapel near Seattle, Washington.<ref name=\"Cre\" /><ref name=\"nme23736\" /> [[DJ Lethal]] [[Programming (music)|programmed]] every song on the album, and John LeCompt was an additional programmer on \"Call Me When You're Sober\" and \"All That I'm Living For\", which was also programmed by [[Bon Harris]].

At the heart of it I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went a lot of different ways with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun.\"<ref name=\"Richard 2006\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview, Lee told MTV News that she pushed her own limits, doing things she didn't have the courage to do in the making of ''Fallen''.<ref name=\"bigbadwolf\" /> he also said her goal was to make a record that she loved even more than ''Fallen'', rather than to copy the formula which made the previous record successful.<ref name=\"bill100305\" /> Incorporating classical influences and several new elements in the music,<ref name=\"jamclasic\" /><ref name=\"armstrong\" />  the sound of the record was inspired by the works of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref name=\"Powers2006locRocks a hard place -- ask Evanescence2\" />\n\nBackground vocals on \"[[Lacrymosa (song)|Lacrymosa]]\" and \"Your Star\" were performed by The Millennium Choir, which worked with the band on several songs on ''Fallen''.<ref name=\"Cre\" /> Richard Harrington of ''The Washington Post'' said the album consists of [[gothic rock]] songs with brooding lyrics and Lee's vocals accompanied by pianos, strings and choirs.<ref name=\"Richard 20061\" /> Other genres present on the album are [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[opera]] and [[pop music]].<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\" /> Jim Farber of ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' explained, \"Evanescence's music again isn't quite metal (unless you think Creed qualifies).

But the resulting hybrid offers a genuine alternative to everything else that's out there.\"<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\" />\n\nFarber further said he found similarities between the songs on ''The Open Door'' and the works of [[Mariah Carey]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Nickelback]] and [[Annie Haslam]].<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\" /> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' felt \"the band's symphonic metal tunes and dark-hearted lyrics are gloomier than ever\".<ref name=\"smh\" /> [[Ann Powers]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the album \"too pop for some and too hard for others\", while describing the lyrics as \"youthfully earnest and sometimes obvious\".<ref name=\"Powers2011locRocks a hard place -- ask Evanescence1\" /> In his review of ''The Open Door'', Jon Dolan of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote, \"The music is still the same crush of chunka-chunka riffs, moody electronic churn, and Valhalla-bound metal slam, all in service of Lee's strikingly operatic singing\".<ref name=\"EW\" /> Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said the songs on the album are similar to the band's \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\" (2003) and \"[[Going Under]]\" (2003), with the \"mix of Lee's ethereal soprano, piano interludes, and layers of serrated guitar crunch that conjure visions of Sarah McLachlan fronting Godsmack\".<ref name=\"bosglobe\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rob Sheffield]] compared Lee's vocals with those of 1980s \"shoulder-pad belters\" like [[Pat Benatar]] and [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]].<ref name=\"rollingstonereview\" /> ''Christianity Today''{{'}}s Andree Farias called the album \"an extension of what the band has done before.

The pre-order, if bought before October 3, 2006, included an interview with Amy Lee and a bonus track titled \"The Last Song I'm Wasting on You\", which later appeared as a B-side track on the \"Lithium\" single.<ref name=\"offnews1\" />\n\n===Singles===\nThe first single from the album was \"Call Me When You're Sober\", which had a limited radio release on July 31, 2006, that preceded a wider release the following week.<ref name=\"SoberPRrelease\" /> Since the track leaked onto the Internet two days before its scheduled release to radio airplay, Wind-up allowed radio stations to play the song ahead of schedule. Subsequently, the recording was made available for [[Music download|digital download]] on September 4, 2006, and a physical release as a single followed on September 25.<ref name=\"nme23736\" /> For the week ending September 9, 2006, the song peaked at number 10 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name=\"callpeak\" /> at number three on the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"callchart\" /> at number five on the [[Australian Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"auscall\" /> and at number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"ukcall\" /> It also charted within the top 20 of several other national charts and was certified [[platinum certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2009, and Gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA).<ref name=\"callriaa\" /><ref name=\"callaria\" />\n\nThe second single from ''The Open Door'', \"[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]\" was released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2007.<ref name=\"lithiumomh\" /> Commercially, it peaked at number 26 on the Australian Singles Chart,<ref name=\"lithiumaus\" /> at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart<ref name=\"lithiumuk\" /> and at number 16 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.<ref name=\"nzlithium\" /> The record's third single was originally planned to be \"All That I'm Living For\", but after considering the wishes of Evanescence and its fans, the label released \"Sweet Sacrifice\" instead.<ref name=\"evthreads136272\" /> It charted in Germany,<ref name=\"gerchartsweet\" /> Turkey<ref name=\"bb-turkey\" /> and on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]].<ref name=\"amgsweet\" /> Although \"Lithium\" and \"Sweet Sacrifice\" charted within the top 40 on the United States' rock charts, both failed to reach the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Bill Richards, senior vice-president of marketing and sales at Wind-Up Records, attributed the album's reduced airplay to not having \"the hard rock [tracks] to solidify the base, and it wasn't melodic and poppy enough with big hooks to go to pop\".<ref name=\"landscape\" /> \"[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]\" was to be released as the fourth single exclusively in Germany,<ref name=\"am-k7gm\" /><ref name=\"am-k7gw\" /> but its release was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\n===Other notable songs===\n\"Weight of the World\" was released as a [[Promotional recording|promotional single]] in October 2007 exclusively in Colombia.<ref name=\"lafm25563\" /> \"Together Again\", a track recorded for ''The Open Door'' which was later rejected, was made available as a free digital download on January 22, 2010, to benefit the [[United Nations Foundation]] for their recovery efforts following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]].<ref name=\"unf2010\" /><ref name=\"roll201001\" /><ref name=\"digi199047\" /> Lee spoke of the recording, \"I am deeply moved by the tragic loss and devastation in Haiti.

And I was like, 'Hell yeah! Let me die. I want to be somebody who gets murdered.' So I don't think that's going to happen.\"<ref name=\"mtv1493917\" /> It was later also revealed that the album track \"Lacrymosa\" was originally written for the film but was not included in it.<ref name=\"metaledge\" /> According to the film's producers, neither Lee nor the band were approached to compose music for the film.<ref name=\"nzh569\" /> Reportedly, another track was completed for the movie, but was rejected due to its dark sound.<ref name=\"metaledge\" />\n\n===Tour===\n[[File:Evanescence miami 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Amy Lee during a concert in 2007]]\n\nThe first leg of The Open Door Tour began on October 5, 2006 in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada,<ref name=\"tourbegin\" /> and finished on December 15, 2006 in [[New York City]].

The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and [[marmalade]]s are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, \"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.\n\n== Regional terminology ==\n[[File:Jams, Jellies, Honeys-Minnesota State Fair.jpg|thumb|Jams, jellies and honeys, [[Minnesota State Fair]]]]\nThe term ''preserves'' is usually interchangeable with ''jams'' even though ''preserves'' contain chunks or pieces of the fruit whereas ''jams'' in some regions do not. Other names include: ''chutney'', ''confit'', ''conserve'', ''fruit butter'', ''fruit curd'', ''fruit spread'', ''jelly'', and ''[[marmalade]]''.\n\nSome cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit.<ref name=\"joc\" /> In the English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and, when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.<ref>Howard L & Patten M (eds), 1960, The Australian Women's Weekly&nbsp;\u2014 Cookery in colour, Paul Hamlin LTD, London UK, sections956-971</ref>\n\nThe singular ''preserve'' or ''conserve'' is used as a collective noun for high fruit content jam, often for marketing purposes. Additionally, the name of the type of fruit preserves will also vary depending on the regional variant of English being used.\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:Ribotroshhashana.jpg|thumb|Five varieties of fruit preserves (clockwise from top): apple, quince, plum, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], orange (in the center)]]\n\n=== Chutney ===\n{{Main|Chutney}}\n\nA '''chutney''' is a relish of Indian origin made of fruit, spices and herbs.

It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette \"jelly bag\" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]].\n\n<blockquote>Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit from which it is made.

It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, [[bergamot orange|bergamots]] and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]] by its inclusion of fruit peel.\n\nThe benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish [[Bitter orange|Seville orange]], ''Citrus aurantium'' var.

In America, marmalade is sweet.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bubbling Jam.jpg|right|thumb|Jam being made in a pot]]\n\nIn general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104&nbsp;\u00b0C (219&nbsp;\u00b0F),<ref>MookyChick Central. (3 September 2014).

''MookyChick''. Retrieved 11 June 2015.</ref> the [[acid]] and the [[pectin]] in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by [[trial and error]], bringing the mixture to a \"fast rolling [[boiling|boil]]\", watching to see if the seething mass changes [[Texture (food)|texture]], and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.<ref>Ball Blue Book of Preserving, Alltrista Consumer Products, June 2004 {{ISBN|0-9727537-0-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-9727537-0-8}}</ref>\n\nCommercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to {{convert|95|to|100|C|F}} to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.\n\nDuring commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down [[tamper evident|tamper-evident]] safety button when used.\n\n== Packaging ==\nGlass or plastic [[jar]]s are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low [[water activity]] and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.\n\n== Legal definitions ==\n\n=== US FDA definitions ===\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves.

The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and [[marmalade]]s are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, \"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.\n\n== Regional terminology ==\n[[File:Jams, Jellies, Honeys-Minnesota State Fair.jpg|thumb|Jams, jellies and honeys, [[Minnesota State Fair]]]]\nThe term ''preserves'' is usually interchangeable with ''jams'' even though ''preserves'' contain chunks or pieces of the fruit whereas ''jams'' in some regions do not. Other names include: ''chutney'', ''confit'', ''conserve'', ''fruit butter'', ''fruit curd'', ''fruit spread'', ''jelly'', and ''[[marmalade]]''.\n\nSome cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit.<ref name=\"joc\" /> In the English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and, when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.<ref>Howard L & Patten M (eds), 1960, The Australian Women's Weekly&nbsp;\u2014 Cookery in colour, Paul Hamlin LTD, London UK, sections956-971</ref>\n\nThe singular ''preserve'' or ''conserve'' is used as a collective noun for high fruit content jam, often for marketing purposes.

In some parts of Eastern Europe, another version called [[slatko]] is made; in Serbia and Croatia, a spoonful is offered to guests, along with a glass of water. \n\nOften the making of conserves can be trickier than making a standard jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough time to allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit,<ref name=\"Patten-Basics\">{{Cite book|last=Patten|first=Marguerite|title=Basic Basics: Jams, Preserves and Chutneys Handbook|publisher=Grub Street Books|date=February 2001|edition=2004 reprint|isbn=1-902304-72-1}}</ref> and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify.

It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.\n\nPectin is essential to the formation of jelly because it acts as a [[Thickening agent|gelling agent]], meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the bonds they form depend on the pH of the pectin, the optimal pH is between 2.8 and 3.2.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|title=Jams, Jellies and Marmalades|publisher=Herbstreith & Fox|location=Neuenb\u00fcrg/W\u00fcrtt|pages=7, 11\u201313|via=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924110055/http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.<ref name=\"usda\" />\nJelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette \"jelly bag\" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]].\n\n<blockquote>Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit from which it is made. It is tender enough to quiver when moved, but holds angles when cut... Pectin is best extracted from the fruit by heat, therefore cook the fruit until soft before straining to obtain the juice&nbsp;...

It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, [[bergamot orange|bergamots]] and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]] by its inclusion of fruit peel.\n\nThe benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish [[Bitter orange|Seville orange]], ''Citrus aurantium'' var. ''aurantium'', prized for its high [[pectin]] content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve.  In America, marmalade is sweet.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bubbling Jam.jpg|right|thumb|Jam being made in a pot]]\n\nIn general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104&nbsp;\u00b0C (219&nbsp;\u00b0F),<ref>MookyChick Central. (3 September 2014). [http://www.mookychick.co.uk/how-to/how-to-guides/how-to-make-jam.php \"How To Make Jam\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612050423/http://www.mookychick.co.uk/how-to/how-to-guides/how-to-make-jam.php |date=12 June 2015 }}. ''MookyChick''. Retrieved 11 June 2015.</ref> the [[acid]] and the [[pectin]] in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by [[trial and error]], bringing the mixture to a \"fast rolling [[boiling|boil]]\", watching to see if the seething mass changes [[Texture (food)|texture]], and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.<ref>Ball Blue Book of Preserving, Alltrista Consumer Products, June 2004 {{ISBN|0-9727537-0-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-9727537-0-8}}</ref>\n\nCommercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to {{convert|95|to|100|C|F}} to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.\n\nDuring commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down [[tamper evident|tamper-evident]] safety button when used.\n\n== Packaging ==\nGlass or plastic [[jar]]s are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low [[water activity]] and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.\n\n== Legal definitions ==\n\n=== US FDA definitions ===\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves. All of these are cooked and pectin-gelled fruit products, but jellies are based entirely on fruit juice or other liquids, while jams and preserves are gelled fruit that may include the seeds and pulp. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] offers grading service based on these standards.<ref name=\"usda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/ppbweb/manuals/jelly.pdf|title=Grading Manual for Fruit Jelly Fruit Preserves|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709211406/http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/ppbweb/manuals/jelly.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian regulations ===\nUnder the Processed Products Regulations (C.R.C., c. 291), jams, jellies, citrus marmalade and preserves are defined.

Jams \"shall be the product made by boiling fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit to a suitable consistency with water and a sweetening ingredient\", jellies \"shall be the product made by boiling fruit juice or concentrated fruit juice that is free from seeds and pulp with water and a sweetening ingredient until it acquires a gelatinous consistency.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._291/page-21.html?term=jams+jam#sched2 |title=Processed Products Regulations |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414043225/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._291/page-21.html?term=jams+jam#sched2 |archivedate=14 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== European Union directives on jam ===\nIn the [[European Union]], the jam [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979)<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31979L0693:EN:NOT Council Directive 79/693/EEC of 24 July 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut pur\u00e9e.] Not in force, replaced by Directive 2001/113/EC.</ref> set minimum standards for the amount of \"fruit\" in jam, but the definition of fruit was expanded to take account of several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU.
