{"title_page": "Renfrew Collegiate Institute", "text_new": "'''Renfrew Collegiate Institute''' (RCI) is a secondary school in the town of [[Renfrew, Ontario]], and is part of the [[Renfrew County District School Board]]. Located at 184 Bonnechere Street South Renfrew Collegiate Institute is one of two high schools in Renfrew, Ontario. In 2015, Renfrew Collegiate Institute ranked 558 in Ontario Secondary Schools, according to Fraser Institute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compare academic rankings and ratings of Ontario schools|url=http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/SchoolsByRankLocationName.aspx|website=ontario.compareschoolrankings.org}}</ref> Feeder schools include Queen Elizabeth Public School, Central Public School, and Admaston Township Public School.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn January, 1881, the first classes were held at the Renfrew High School. Mr. Charles McDowell was the first Principal.  Enrolment grew rapidly and an enlarged building was opened on the same site in January 1896.  In 1902, Renfrew High School applied for and received \"Collegiate\" status after having fulfilled numerous requirements.  Renfrew High School thus became Renfrew Collegiate in 1902. A gym was added to Renfrew Collegiate in 1911.\n\nThe original building that housed Renfrew Collegiate was eventually condemned due to sagging joists, inadequate ventilation and insufficient lighting.  Students were housed in the Armouries for two years while the new school was being constructed.  In 1923, a new, three story building was completed, consisting of 19 classrooms, a library, three science labs and an auditorium with a gymnasium underneath.  In 1924, there were 390 students enrolled and 13 staff were employed at Renfrew Collegiate.  The shop wing (formerly the gym which was constructed in 1911) was destroyed by fire in 1958.  This wing was immediately replaced with a two-story wing containing five classrooms and a staff room.\n\nThe \"Baby Boom\" and society's increased insistence that students remain in school until graduation resulted in a sharp increase in enrolment and therefore demand for educational facilities in the 1960s.  A renovation in 1963, costing over $1,000,000, resulted in the creation of a new Technical Education wing and a new double gymnasium called the Grant Gymnasium, along with some modernization of the 1922 building.  The old gym was also converted into a much needed cafeteria.  In 1966 the school expanded yet again, adding 13 classrooms and a second gym called the MacNeil Gymnasium with a greenhouse on top.  Stewart Field was also acquired in 1969, thanks in part to a bequest from the estate of Mrs. D. W. Stewart.  The student population in 1970 was just under 1300 students.  The staff totalled 81.  In 1971, a new entrance and library was added to Renfrew Collegiate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Leslie|title=Centennial Harpooner, 1881-1981|date=1981|publisher=Renfrew Printing}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nAs of 2018, Renfrew Collegiate Institute offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\n[[File:McDonald Engineering Building, McGill University, Montreal, QC, about 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|The old [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering#Buildings & Laboratories|Macdonald Engineering Building]], the School of Architecture's original home.]]\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (1894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building was damaged by fire in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

One of the burial caves is especially grandiose, with a door post decorated with carvings of wreaths, grape vines and grape clusters standing at its entrance.<ref name=\"Taha\"/>\n\nLocals consider Saint Barbara to have been the oldest and most sacred of Aboud's churches. [[Palestinian Christian]]s visited the church annually on 17 December to celebrate the St. Barbara's Day festival. On 31 May 2002, the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] blew up and destroyed the church. The Israeli military claimed that they were unaware of the church's significance and demolished it by mistake.<ref name=\"ARIJ\"/>\n\nAl-Abudiyah Church, also known as Saint Mary's Church, is situated in the center of Aboud. It was long believed to have been founded during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] period in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], when it was known as ''Casale Santa Maria.'' But, an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription on a vault in the church, found during late 20th century restoration work, indicates that it was founded before the arrival of Crusaders, but fell into disrepair. According to the inscription, the church was rebuilt in 1058 CE during the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era. In the 18th century an additional wall, as well as several windows and doors were constructed.<ref name=\"Taha\"/>\n\nRestorations were conducted in 1997. The cement plaster in the vaulting of the church was replaced with traditional mortar, stones inside the church were cleaned, the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] was repaved, and a reinforcing northern wall was constructed.<ref name=\"Taha\"/> In 2013 Christians from the United Kingdom worked on a project with the church choir of St. Mary's Church to record \"The Mary Prayers\"<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Mary-Prayers/dp/B00EFASG70 The Mary Prayers]</ref> as a fundraising initiative. Proceeds from the sales of the CD or downloads are directed to humanitarian projects for the Muslims and Christians in Aboud.\n\nAdditional local churches include one dedicated to [[Theodore the Studite|St. Theodore]] (located in the center of the village) and to St. Anastasia (to the south of the village). Both are from the 7th\u20138th centuries.<ref name=\"Dauphin\">Dauphin, 1998, p. 825</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, Aboud's economy was centered on agriculture, specifically olives. Their cultivation in the 21st century takes up 43% of village lands. In total, 57% of Aboud's lands are cultivable; other crops are figs, apples, grapes, and almonds. Its primary agricultural products are [[olive oil]], [[Nabulsi soap|olive-based soap]], dried figs, and almonds. In 2005 agriculture employed 19% of the village's labor force. The remaining 81% work in the governmental and private sectors, construction, and animal husbandry.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Intifada]], which began in 2000, the residents who worked in Israel (10% of Aboud's labor force) lost their jobs there.<ref name=\"ARIJ\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | editor =Barron, J.B. | title = Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922 |url=https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922 |publisher = Government of Palestine | year = 1923}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clermont-Ganneau|first=C.S.|authorlink=Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|title=Recueil d'arch\u00e9ologie orientale|url=https://archive.org/details/RecueilDarcheologieOrientaletome2|volume=2|year=1898|location=Paris|language=French}}  (p.

After [[Oslo II Accord|Oslo II]] in 1995, 16.8% of village land was classified as [[Area B]], and the remaining 83.2% as [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]. Israel has confiscated land from Aboud in order to construct the [[Israeli settlement]]s of [[Beit Aryeh]] and [[Beit Aryeh-Ofarim|Ofarim]].<ref>\n[http://vprofile.arij.org/ramallah/pdfs/vprofile/Abud_Vp_En.pdf  \u2018Abud Village Profile], ARIJ, pp. 16-17</ref> In late July 2018, Israeli authorities informed village elders that they intended confiscating as further 324 dunums (80 acres) of land shared by both Aboud and [[Al-Lubban al-Gharbi]]. The grounds for the confiscation was that the land was needed in order to construct an Israeli-only road between the settlements of Beit Arye and Ofarim, which were both, according to villagers, built on Aboud lands.<ref>Yumna Patel, [https://mondoweiss.net/2018/08/settlements-christian-palestine/ 'Drowning among Israeli settlements, an ancient Christian village in Palestine struggles to survive],' [[Mondoweiss]] 17 August 2018</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], the village had a population of approximately 2,084 inhabitants in 2007.<ref name=\"2007 PCBS Census\"/> It has a mixed population of [[Muslim]]s and [[Palestinian Christians|Christian]]s, mostly Eastern Orthodox. It has ancient churches built during the [[History of Palestine#Late Roman Empire period|Byzantine period]] of the 6th to 8th centuries.\n\n==Ancient churches==\n\nAdjacent to Aboud is an ancient monastery named after [[Saint Barbara]]. Located on a hill due west of the village, the Church of Saint Barbara was erected in the [[History of Palestine#Late Roman Empire period|Byzantine period]].<ref name=\"Taha\"/> Archaeologists trace its history to the 6th century CE.<ref name=\"ARIJ\">[http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=604 'Aboud, the city of flowers, threatened by the Israeli Segregation Wall] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614142353/http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=604 |date=14 June 2012 }} Applied Research Institute \u2013 Jerusalem. 2005-06-09.</ref> Ancient [[catacombs]] have been uncovered by the church; their [[absolute dating|dating]] is uncertain. One of the burial caves is especially grandiose, with a door post decorated with carvings of wreaths, grape vines and grape clusters standing at its entrance.<ref name=\"Taha\"/>\n\nLocals consider Saint Barbara to have been the oldest and most sacred of Aboud's churches. [[Palestinian Christian]]s visited the church annually on 17 December to celebrate the St. Barbara's Day festival. On 31 May 2002, the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] blew up and destroyed the church. The Israeli military claimed that they were unaware of the church's significance and demolished it by mistake.<ref name=\"ARIJ\"/>\n\nAl-Abudiyah Church, also known as Saint Mary's Church, is situated in the center of Aboud. It was long believed to have been founded during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] period in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], when it was known as ''Casale Santa Maria.'' But, an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription on a vault in the church, found during late 20th century restoration work, indicates that it was founded before the arrival of Crusaders, but fell into disrepair. According to the inscription, the church was rebuilt in 1058 CE during the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era. In the 18th century an additional wall, as well as several windows and doors were constructed.<ref name=\"Taha\"/>\n\nRestorations were conducted in 1997. The cement plaster in the vaulting of the church was replaced with traditional mortar, stones inside the church were cleaned, the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] was repaved, and a reinforcing northern wall was constructed.<ref name=\"Taha\"/> In 2013 Christians from the United Kingdom worked on a project with the church choir of St. Mary's Church to record \"The Mary Prayers\"<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Mary-Prayers/dp/B00EFASG70 The Mary Prayers]</ref> as a fundraising initiative. Proceeds from the sales of the CD or downloads are directed to humanitarian projects for the Muslims and Christians in Aboud.\n\nAdditional local churches include one dedicated to [[Theodore the Studite|St. Theodore]] (located in the center of the village) and to St. Anastasia (to the south of the village). Both are from the 7th\u20138th centuries.<ref name=\"Dauphin\">Dauphin, 1998, p. 825</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, Aboud's economy was centered on agriculture, specifically olives. Their cultivation in the 21st century takes up 43% of village lands. In total, 57% of Aboud's lands are cultivable; other crops are figs, apples, grapes, and almonds. Its primary agricultural products are [[olive oil]], [[Nabulsi soap|olive-based soap]], dried figs, and almonds. In 2005 agriculture employed 19% of the village's labor force. The remaining 81% work in the governmental and private sectors, construction, and animal husbandry.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Intifada]], which began in 2000, the residents who worked in Israel (10% of Aboud's labor force) lost their jobs there.<ref name=\"ARIJ\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | editor =Barron, J.B. | title = Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922 |url=https://archive.org/details/PalestineCensus1922 |publisher = Government of Palestine | year = 1923}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clermont-Ganneau|first=C.S.|authorlink=Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|title=Recueil d'arch\u00e9ologie orientale|url=https://archive.org/details/RecueilDarcheologieOrientaletome2|volume=2|year=1898|location=Paris|language=French}}  (p.

'Therefore the universe has a cause of its existence' Following Ghazali, Craig argues that this cause must be a personal will. Nothing but the arbitrary choice of a free agent could account for the fact that the world was created at one time rather than another, or (if time comes into being with the first event) for the fact that the first event did not have a predecessor.{{sfn|Wainwright|1982|p=328}} }}{{sfnm |1a1=Cowan |1a2=Spiegel |1y=2009 |1pp=268\u2013269<!-- \"The Kalam argument originated with Arabic philosophers in the Middle Ages but has recently been taken up by Christian philosophers, especially William Lane Craig and J.P.

Nothing but the arbitrary choice of a free agent could account for the fact that the world was created at one time rather than another, or (if time comes into being with the first event) for the fact that the first event did not have a predecessor.{{sfn|Wainwright|1982|p=328}} }}{{sfnm |1a1=Cowan |1a2=Spiegel |1y=2009 |1pp=268\u2013269<!-- \"The Kalam argument originated with Arabic philosophers in the Middle Ages but has recently been taken up by Christian philosophers, especially William Lane Craig and J.P.
