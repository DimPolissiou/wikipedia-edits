The two players met each other in the loser's finals of [[Evo 2004]]'s ''Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike'' tournament. Umehara, playing using the character [[Ken (Street Fighter)|Ken]], was down to his last pixel of [[health (video gaming)|vitality]] and any special attack by Wong's [[Chun-Li]] could knock Ken out. Wong attempted to hit his opponent with Chun-Li's \"Super Art\" move, forcing Umehara to parry 15 attacks in a very short period of time. Umehara did so successfully and went on to counter a final kick of Chun-Li in mid-air before launching a combo move himself and winning the match. Though Umehara lost the grand finals to Kenji Obata, the clip of him parrying Wong's multihit attack became hugely influential and has been compared to famous sports moments such as [[Babe Ruth's called shot]] and the [[Miracle on Ice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17391663/daigo-jwong-legacy-street-fighter-moment-37|work=[[ESPN]]|title=Daigo and JWong: the legacy of Street Fighter's Moment 37|last=Markazi|first=Arash|date=2016-08-26|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113113605/http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17391663/daigo-jwong-legacy-street-fighter-moment-37|archive-date=2017-11-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/why-street-fighter-match-is-esports-most-thrilling-moment-w430344|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Flashback: Why 2004 'Street Fighter' Match Is Esports' Most Thrilling Moment|last=Baker|first=Chris|date=2016-07-21|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926144427/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/why-street-fighter-match-is-esports-most-thrilling-moment-w430344|archive-date=2017-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Evo Moment 37]]\", also known as the \"Daigo Parry\", is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of [[competitive video gaming]].

The two players met each other in the loser's finals of [[Evo 2004]]'s ''Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike'' tournament. Umehara, playing using the character [[Ken (Street Fighter)|Ken]], was down to his last pixel of [[health (video gaming)|vitality]] and any special attack by Wong's [[Chun-Li]] could knock Ken out. Wong attempted to hit his opponent with Chun-Li's \"Super Art\" move, forcing Umehara to parry 15 attacks in a very short period of time. Umehara did so successfully and went on to counter a final kick of Chun-Li in mid-air before launching a combo move himself and winning the match. Though Umehara lost the grand finals to Kenji Obata, the clip of him parrying Wong's multihit attack became hugely influential and has been compared to famous sports moments such as [[Babe Ruth's called shot]] and the [[Miracle on Ice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17391663/daigo-jwong-legacy-street-fighter-moment-37|work=[[ESPN]]|title=Daigo and JWong: the legacy of Street Fighter's Moment 37|last=Markazi|first=Arash|date=2016-08-26|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113113605/http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17391663/daigo-jwong-legacy-street-fighter-moment-37|archive-date=2017-11-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/why-street-fighter-match-is-esports-most-thrilling-moment-w430344|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Flashback: Why 2004 'Street Fighter' Match Is Esports' Most Thrilling Moment|last=Baker|first=Chris|date=2016-07-21|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926144427/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/why-street-fighter-match-is-esports-most-thrilling-moment-w430344|archive-date=2017-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Evo Moment 37]]\", also known as the \"Daigo Parry\", is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of [[competitive video gaming]].

She succeeded her third husband as [[Lord of the Isle of Wight|Lady of the Isle of Wight]] (1415\u20131431).\n\n==Origins==\nPhilippa's birthdate is unknown. She was the third daughter and co-heiress of [[John de Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun|John Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun]] (c.1320\u20131375), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], one of the Founding Knights of the [[Order of the Garter]], [[Feudal barony of Dunster|feudal baron of Dunster]], of [[Dunster Castle]], Somerset, by his wife Joan Burghersh (d.1404), daughter of [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh]] (c.1304\u20131355).\n\n==Inheritance==\nAlthough her father was the last in the male line of Mohun of Dunster (for he died without male issue), neither she nor either of her sisters inherited their paternal estates at Dunster. (These lands had been held by the family since before the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.) This was owing to the fact that her mother Lady Mohun (died 1404) had sold the [[reversion (law)|reversion]] of the estates in 1374 to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell (d.1395), wife of Sir Andrew Luttrell and a daughter of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon]] (1303\u20131377).<ref>[[Henry Maxwell Lyte|Maxwell Lyte, Sir Henry]], ''A History of Dunster and of the Families of Mohun and Luttrell'', Part I (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London 1909), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdunster01lyte#page/n17/mode/2up pp. xii-xiii] (Internet Archive).</ref> The [[Sir Hugh Luttrell|Luttrell family]] and their later descendants in a female line from 1737 owned Dunster Castle until 1976, when it was donated to the [[National Trust]].\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nPhilippa married three times: \n*First to [[Baron Fitzwalter|Walter Fitzwalter, 4th Baron Fitzwalter]] (d. 26 September 1386); this marriage produced one son named Walter, 5th Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1407) mentioned in his mother's will.\n*Secondly to Sir John Golafre (d. 18 November 1396), the bastard son of Sir John Golafre (d.1379) of Sarsden in Oxfordshire, Bury Blunsdon in Wiltshire, Fyfield in Garford and Frilford in Berkshire, eldest son of Sir John Golafre (d.1363), MP. He was a favoured knight of the chamber of King Richard II (1377\u20131399) and was Constable of [[Wallingford Castle]]. He was a notable jouster. He died on 18 November 1396 and at the king's order was buried in the royal chapel in Westminster Abbey.<ref>J.S. Roskell and L.S. Woodger, 'Golafre, John (d.1442), of Fyfield, Berks.', in J.S.

By her third marriage Philippa became Duchess of York. Following Edward's death at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] she received a grant for life of the [[Lord of the Isle of Wight|Lordship of the Isle of Wight]], previously held by her husband, and on 10 December 1415 was styled ''Lady of the Isle of Wight''.\n\n==Death and burial==\nPhilippa died 17 July 1431 at her seat of [[Carisbrooke Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=903}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=365\u20138}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|pp=211\u201312}}; {{Harvnb|Horrox|2004}}</ref> where her chest tomb and effigy survive in the Chapel of St Nicholas.<ref>'Philippa Mohun, Duchess of York' [http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/philippa-mohun,-duchess-of-york (Westminster Abbey website)].</ref> Also buried in Westminster Abbey were her mother Lady Mohun (d.1404), whose effigy survives in the crypt, and her second husband Sir John Golafre (d.1396), who was interred in the royal chapel, his grave marked by a [[monumental brass]] now lost.\n\n==Monument in Westminster Abbey==\nHer monument is today situated in the north-west corner of the Chapel of St Nicholas, Westminster Abbey, with one side against the chapel's screen, but before 1600 was situated in the centre of the chapel.

The Latin inscription, of which only two words now survive, was recorded in a work on the Abbey's history published in 1822 as follows: (translated): ''\"Philippa daughter and co-heir of John Lord Mohun of Dunster who died Anno Domini 1431\"''. An earlier work stated the inscription to have included also the words: ''\"wife of Edward Duke of York\"''.<ref>'Philippa Mohun, Duchess of York' [http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/philippa-mohun,-duchess-of-york (Westminster Abbey website)].</ref>\n\n==Last will and testament==\nThe text of the last will of Philippa de Mohun (in French) was published by [[Richard Gough]] in 1780.<ref>R.

She succeeded her third husband as [[Lord of the Isle of Wight|Lady of the Isle of Wight]] (1415\u20131431).\n\n==Origins==\nPhilippa's birthdate is unknown. She was the third daughter and co-heiress of [[John de Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun|John Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun]] (c.1320\u20131375), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], one of the Founding Knights of the [[Order of the Garter]], [[Feudal barony of Dunster|feudal baron of Dunster]], of [[Dunster Castle]], Somerset, by his wife Joan Burghersh (d.1404), daughter of [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh]] (c.1304\u20131355).\n\n==Inheritance==\nAlthough her father was the last in the male line of Mohun of Dunster (for he died without male issue), neither she nor either of her sisters inherited their paternal estates at Dunster. (These lands had been held by the family since before the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.) This was owing to the fact that her mother Lady Mohun (died 1404) had sold the [[reversion (law)|reversion]] of the estates in 1374 to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell (d.1395), wife of Sir Andrew Luttrell and a daughter of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon]] (1303\u20131377).<ref>[[Henry Maxwell Lyte|Maxwell Lyte, Sir Henry]], ''A History of Dunster and of the Families of Mohun and Luttrell'', Part I (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London 1909), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdunster01lyte#page/n17/mode/2up pp. xii-xiii] (Internet Archive).</ref> The [[Sir Hugh Luttrell|Luttrell family]] and their later descendants in a female line from 1737 owned Dunster Castle until 1976, when it was donated to the [[National Trust]].\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nPhilippa married three times: \n*First to [[Baron Fitzwalter|Walter Fitzwalter, 4th Baron Fitzwalter]] (d. 26 September 1386); this marriage produced one son named Walter, 5th Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1407) mentioned in his mother's will.\n*Secondly to Sir John Golafre (d. 18 November 1396), the bastard son of Sir John Golafre (d.1379) of Sarsden in Oxfordshire, Bury Blunsdon in Wiltshire, Fyfield in Garford and Frilford in Berkshire, eldest son of Sir John Golafre (d.1363), MP. He was a favoured knight of the chamber of King Richard II (1377\u20131399) and was Constable of [[Wallingford Castle]]. He was a notable jouster.

The fire killed approximately 300 people, destroyed roughly {{convert|3.3|sqmi|km2|0}} of the city, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless.<ref name=Rayfield1997 />  The fire began in a neighborhood southwest of the city center. A long period of hot, dry, windy conditions, and the wooden construction prevalent in the city led to a [[conflagration]]. The fire leapt the south branch of the [[Chicago River]] and destroyed much of central Chicago and then leapt the main branch of the river, consuming the near north side.\n\nHelp flowed to the city from near and far after the fire. The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards. A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the [[Chicago Public Library]], a free public library system, a contrast to the private, fee-for-membership libraries common before the fire.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:1871 Chicago view before the Great Conflagration.jpg|thumb|right|1871 Chicago view before the 'Great Conflagration']]\nThe fire is claimed to have started at about 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on October&nbsp;8, in or around a small barn belonging to the O'Leary family that bordered the alley behind 137 [[DeKoven Street (Chicago)|DeKoven Street]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pierce |first=Bessie Louise |authorlink=Bessie Louise Pierce |title=A History of Chicago: Volume III: The Rise of a Modern City, 1871\u20131893 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |orig-year=1957 |year=2007 |version=Republished |location=Chicago |page=4 |isbn=978-0-226-66842-0}}</ref> The shed next to the barn was the first building to be consumed by the fire. City officials never determined the exact cause of the blaze,<ref name=\"owen\">{{cite book |first=L.L. |last=Owens |title=The Great Chicago Fire |publisher=ABDO |page=7 |isbn=978-1604538076|date=2007-08-01 }}</ref> but the rapid spread of the fire due to a long drought in the prior summer, strong winds from the southwest, and the rapid destruction of the water pumping system explain the extensive damage of the mainly wooden city structures. There has been much speculation over the years on a single start to the fire. The most popular tale blames [[Catherine O'Leary|Mrs. O'Leary's cow]], who allegedly knocked over a lantern; others state that a group of men were gambling inside the barn and knocked over a lantern.<ref name=\"JimMurphy\"/> Still other speculation suggests that the blaze was related to [[:Category:1871 fires|other fires in the Midwest that day]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>\n\nThe fire's spread was aided by the city's use of wood as the predominant building material in a style called [[Framing (construction)#Balloon framing|balloon frame]]. More than two-thirds of the structures in Chicago at the time of the fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly flammable [[tar]] or [[Roof shingle|shingle]] roofs. All of the city's sidewalks and many roads were also made of wood.<ref name=\"JimMurphy\">{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Jim |title=The Great Fire |date=1995 |isbn=9780439203074 |publisher=Scholastic Inc |url=https://archive.org/details/greatfire00jimm }}</ref> Compounding this problem, Chicago received only {{convert|1|in|mm}} of rain from July&nbsp;4 to October&nbsp;9, causing severe [[drought]] conditions before the fire, while strong southwest winds helped to carry flying embers toward the heart of the city.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\">{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Donald |title=City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America |url=https://archive.org/details/cityofcentury00dona |url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0684831381|page=}}</ref>{{rp|144}}\n\nIn 1871, the [[Chicago Fire Department]] had 185 [[firefighter]]s with just 17 horse-drawn steam engines to protect the entire city.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|146}} The initial response by the fire department was quick, but due to an error by the watchman, Matthias Schaffer, the firefighters were sent to the wrong place, allowing the fire to grow unchecked.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|146}} An alarm sent from the area near the fire also failed to register at the courthouse where the fire watchmen were, while the firefighters were tired from having fought numerous small fires and one large fire in the week before.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Fire Fiend |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |page=3 |date=October 8, 1871 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1871/10/08/page/3/article/the-fire-fiend |accessdate=November 27, 2007}}</ref> These factors combined to turn a small barn fire into a conflagration.\n\n==Spread==\n[[File:Great Chicago Fire map with starting point.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1869 map of Chicago, altered to show the area destroyed by the fire (location of O'Leary's barn indicated by red dot)]]\nWhen firefighters finally arrived at DeKoven Street, the fire had grown and spread to neighboring buildings and was progressing toward the central business district. Firefighters had hoped that the South Branch of the Chicago River and an area that had previously thoroughly burned would act as a natural [[firebreak]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|147}} All along the river, however, were lumber yards, warehouses, and coal yards, and barges and numerous bridges across the river. As the fire grew, the southwest wind intensified and became superheated, causing structures to catch fire from the heat and from burning debris blown by the wind. Around midnight, flaming debris blew across the river and landed on roofs and the South Side Gas Works.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|148}}\n\nWith the fire across the river and moving rapidly toward the heart of the city, panic set in. About this time, Mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] sent messages to nearby towns asking for help. When the courthouse caught fire, he ordered the building to be evacuated and the prisoners jailed in the basement to be released. At 2:30&nbsp;a.m. on the 9th, the cupola of the courthouse collapsed, sending the great bell crashing down.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|148}} Some witnesses reported hearing the sound from a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) away.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs more buildings succumbed to the flames, a major contributing factor to the fire's spread was a meteorological phenomenon known as a [[fire whirl]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Abbott |first=Karen |title=What (or Who) Caused the Great Chicago Fire? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-or-who-caused-the-great-chicago-fire-61481977/ |date=October 4, 2012 |work=Smithsonian Magazine |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> As overheated air rises, it comes into contact with cooler air and begins to spin creating a tornado-like effect.

A short time after the fire jumped the river, a burning piece of timber lodged on the roof of the city's [[waterworks]]. Within minutes, the interior of the building was engulfed in flames and the building was destroyed.

Due to Chicago's rapid expansion at that time, the fire led to Americans reflecting on industrialization. Based on a religious point of view, some said that Americans should return to a more old-fashioned way of life, and that the fire was caused by people ignoring traditional morality. On the other hand, others believed that a lesson to be learned from the fire was that cities needed to improve their building techniques. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] observed that poor building practices in Chicago were a problem:<ref name=Pauly673/>\n\n<blockquote>Chicago had a weakness for \"big things\", and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|''Chicago Tribune'' editorial]]\n\nOlmsted also believed that with brick walls, and disciplined firemen and police, the deaths and damage caused would have been much less.<ref name=Pauly673>{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Pauly |title=The Great Chicago Fire as a National Event |journal=American Quarterly |volume=36 |number=5 |date=Winter 1984 |pages=673\u2013674 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=2712866}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately, the city began to rewrite its fire standards, spurred by the efforts of leading insurance executives, and fire-prevention reformers such as [[Arthur C.

Chicago soon developed one of the country's leading fire-fighting forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:World Columbian Exposition - White City - 1.JPG|thumb|More than 20 years after the Great Fire, 'The World Colombian Exposition of 1893', known as the 'White City', for being lit up with newly invented light bulbs and electric power.]]\nBusiness owners, and land speculators such as [[Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard]], quickly set about rebuilding the city.

The fire killed approximately 300 people, destroyed roughly {{convert|3.3|sqmi|km2|0}} of the city, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless.<ref name=Rayfield1997 />  The fire began in a neighborhood southwest of the city center. A long period of hot, dry, windy conditions, and the wooden construction prevalent in the city led to a [[conflagration]]. The fire leapt the south branch of the [[Chicago River]] and destroyed much of central Chicago and then leapt the main branch of the river, consuming the near north side.\n\nHelp flowed to the city from near and far after the fire. The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards. A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the [[Chicago Public Library]], a free public library system, a contrast to the private, fee-for-membership libraries common before the fire.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:1871 Chicago view before the Great Conflagration.jpg|thumb|right|1871 Chicago view before the 'Great Conflagration']]\nThe fire is claimed to have started at about 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on October&nbsp;8, in or around a small barn belonging to the O'Leary family that bordered the alley behind 137 [[DeKoven Street (Chicago)|DeKoven Street]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pierce |first=Bessie Louise |authorlink=Bessie Louise Pierce |title=A History of Chicago: Volume III: The Rise of a Modern City, 1871\u20131893 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |orig-year=1957 |year=2007 |version=Republished |location=Chicago |page=4 |isbn=978-0-226-66842-0}}</ref> The shed next to the barn was the first building to be consumed by the fire.

There has been much speculation over the years on a single start to the fire. The most popular tale blames [[Catherine O'Leary|Mrs. O'Leary's cow]], who allegedly knocked over a lantern; others state that a group of men were gambling inside the barn and knocked over a lantern.<ref name=\"JimMurphy\"/> Still other speculation suggests that the blaze was related to [[:Category:1871 fires|other fires in the Midwest that day]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>\n\nThe fire's spread was aided by the city's use of wood as the predominant building material in a style called [[Framing (construction)#Balloon framing|balloon frame]]. More than two-thirds of the structures in Chicago at the time of the fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly flammable [[tar]] or [[Roof shingle|shingle]] roofs.

Firefighters had hoped that the South Branch of the Chicago River and an area that had previously thoroughly burned would act as a natural [[firebreak]].<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|147}} All along the river, however, were lumber yards, warehouses, and coal yards, and barges and numerous bridges across the river. As the fire grew, the southwest wind intensified and became superheated, causing structures to catch fire from the heat and from burning debris blown by the wind. Around midnight, flaming debris blew across the river and landed on roofs and the South Side Gas Works.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|148}}\n\nWith the fire across the river and moving rapidly toward the heart of the city, panic set in. About this time, Mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] sent messages to nearby towns asking for help. When the courthouse caught fire, he ordered the building to be evacuated and the prisoners jailed in the basement to be released. At 2:30&nbsp;a.m. on the 9th, the cupola of the courthouse collapsed, sending the great bell crashing down.<ref name=\"DonaldMiller\"/>{{rp|148}} Some witnesses reported hearing the sound from a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) away.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs more buildings succumbed to the flames, a major contributing factor to the fire's spread was a meteorological phenomenon known as a [[fire whirl]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Abbott |first=Karen |title=What (or Who) Caused the Great Chicago Fire? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-or-who-caused-the-great-chicago-fire-61481977/ |date=October 4, 2012 |work=Smithsonian Magazine |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> As overheated air rises, it comes into contact with cooler air and begins to spin creating a tornado-like effect.

Also likely a factor in the fire's rapid spread was the amount of flammable waste that had accumulated in the river from years of improper disposal methods used by local industries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Signal |first1=Michael A. |title=The Great Chicago Fire |url=https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/sites/default/files_link/schools/files/Domain/13262/4th%20grade%20The_Great_Chicago_Fire.pdf |website=sandiegounified |accessdate=January 22, 2019 |quote=Flames even raced right across the Chicago River, feeding on flammable waste in the water.}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fire spreading and growing rapidly, the city's firefighters continued to battle the blaze. A short time after the fire jumped the river, a burning piece of timber lodged on the roof of the city's [[waterworks]]. Within minutes, the interior of the building was engulfed in flames and the building was destroyed.

Due to Chicago's rapid expansion at that time, the fire led to Americans reflecting on industrialization. Based on a religious point of view, some said that Americans should return to a more old-fashioned way of life, and that the fire was caused by people ignoring traditional morality. On the other hand, others believed that a lesson to be learned from the fire was that cities needed to improve their building techniques. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] observed that poor building practices in Chicago were a problem:<ref name=Pauly673/>\n\n<blockquote>Chicago had a weakness for \"big things\", and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|''Chicago Tribune'' editorial]]\n\nOlmsted also believed that with brick walls, and disciplined firemen and police, the deaths and damage caused would have been much less.<ref name=Pauly673>{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Pauly |title=The Great Chicago Fire as a National Event |journal=American Quarterly |volume=36 |number=5 |date=Winter 1984 |pages=673\u2013674 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=2712866}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately, the city began to rewrite its fire standards, spurred by the efforts of leading insurance executives, and fire-prevention reformers such as [[Arthur C. Ducat]]. Chicago soon developed one of the country's leading fire-fighting forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:World Columbian Exposition - White City - 1.JPG|thumb|More than 20 years after the Great Fire, 'The World Colombian Exposition of 1893', known as the 'White City', for being lit up with newly invented light bulbs and electric power.]]\nBusiness owners, and land speculators such as [[Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard]], quickly set about rebuilding the city.

He became a highly respected and decorated Union [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], reaching the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] (and [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]]). He is best known for his gallantry at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], for which he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. Following the war, he served as [[Governor of Maine]], and the President of [[Bowdoin College]].\n\nChamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] in 1862 and fought at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. He became commander of the regiment in June 1863. On July 2, during the Battle of Gettysburg, Chamberlain's regiment occupied the extreme left of the Union lines at [[Little Round Top]]. Chamberlain's men withstood repeated assaults from the [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry]] and finally drove the Confederates away with a downhill bayonet charge. Chamberlain was severely wounded while commanding a brigade during the [[Second Battle of Petersburg]] in June 1864, and was given what was intended to be a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. In April 1865, he fought at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and was given the honor of commanding the Union troops at the surrender ceremony for the infantry of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia|Army]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia.\n\nAfter the war, he entered politics as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and served four one-year terms of office as the [[List of Governors of Maine|32nd Governor of Maine]]. He served on the faculty, and as president, of his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Bowdoin College]]. He died in 1914 at age 85 due to complications from the wound that he received at Petersburg.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nChamberlain was born in [[Brewer, Maine]], the son of Sarah Dupee (n\u00e9e Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain, on September 8, 1828.  Chamberlain was of English ancestry and could trace his family line back to twelfth-century England, during the reign of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>''Soul of the Lion: A Biography of General Joshua L. Chamberlain'' by Willard M. Wallce, pg.17</ref> He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from college. He entered [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], in 1848 with the help of local tutor and professor, William Hyde.  Chamberlain learned to read [[Ancient Greek]] and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was being published in serial form in the abolitionist paper, ''[[The National Era]]''. He also joined the [[Peucinian Society]], a group of students with [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] leanings. A member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society and a brother of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852.\n \nChamberlain married [[Fanny Chamberlain|Fanny Adams]], cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of who was born too premature to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at [[Bangor Theological Seminary]] in [[Bangor, Maine]], returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a [[professor]] of [[rhetoric]]. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and [[mathematics]]. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages.<ref>Chase, p. 63.</ref> He was fluent in nine languages other than English: [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].\n\nChamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the [[Siege of Yorktown]].  His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the [[War of 1812]] and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating [[Battle of Hampden]], which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces. His father also had served during the abortive [[Aroostook War]] of 1839.\n\n==American Civil War==\n===Early career===\n[[File:Thomas D Chamberlain.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Chamberlain's younger brother, Thomas, who was the Lieutenant Colonel of the 20th Maine]]\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Chamberlain believed the Union needed to be supported against the Confederacy by all those willing. On several occasions, Chamberlain spoke freely of his beliefs during his class, urging students to follow their hearts in regards to the war while maintaining that the cause was just. Of his desire to serve in the War, he wrote to Maine's Governor [[Israel Washburn, Jr.]], \"I fear, this war, so costly of blood and treasure, will not cease until men of the North are willing to leave good positions, and sacrifice the dearest personal interests, to rescue our country from desolation, and defend the national existence against treachery.\"<ref>As cited in: Thomas A. Desjardin, ''Joshua L. Chamberlain'', Greystone Communication, 1999, p. 22.</ref> Many faculty at Bowdoin did not feel his enthusiasm for various reasons and Chamberlain was subsequently granted a leave of absence (supposedly to study languages for two years in [[Europe]]). He then promptly enlisted unbeknownst to those at Bowdoin and his family. Offered the [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]cy of the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine Regiment]], he declined, according to his biographer, John J.

The 20th was assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] in the Union [[Army of the Potomac]].  One of Chamberlain's younger brothers, [[Thomas Chamberlain (soldier)|Thomas Chamberlain]], was also an officer of the 20th Maine, and another, John Chamberlain, visited the regiment at Gettysburg as a member of the [[U.S. Christian Commission]] until appointed as a chaplain in another Maine Volunteer regiment.\nThe 20th Maine fought at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], suffering relatively small numbers of casualties in the assaults on Marye's Heights, but were forced to spend a miserable night on the freezing battlefield among the many wounded from other regiments. Chamberlain chronicled this night well in his diary and went to great length discussing his having to use bodies of the fallen for shelter and a pillow while listening to the bullets zip into the corpses.\nThe 20th missed the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863 due to an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in their ranks (which was caused by an errant smallpox vaccine), keeping them on guard duty in the rear.<ref>Desjardin, pp. 4-5.</ref> Chamberlain was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the regiment in June 1863 upon the promotion of Ames.\n\n====Battle of Gettysburg====\n[[File:Ellis Spear - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Capt.

O'Sullivan]], 1863]]\n\nChamberlain became most famous for his achievements during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. On July 2, the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day|second day of the battle]], Union forces were recovering from initial setbacks and hastily regrouping into defensive positions on a line of hills south of the town. Sensing the momentary vulnerability of the Union forces, the Confederates began an attack against the Union left flank. Chamberlain's brigade, commanded by Col. [[Strong Vincent]], was sent to defend [[Little Round Top]] by the army's Chief of Engineers, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]]. Chamberlain found himself and the 20th Maine at the far left end of the entire Union line. He quickly understood the strategic significance of the small hill, and the need for the 20th Maine to hold the Union left at all costs. The men from Maine waited until troops from the [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry]], commanded by Col. [[William C. Oates]], charged up the hill, attempting to flank the Union position. Time and time again the Confederates struck, until the 20th Maine was almost doubled back upon itself. With many casualties and ammunition running low, Col. Chamberlain recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing (which was now looking southeast, compared to the rest of the regiment, which was facing west) to initiate a bayonet charge. From his report of the day: \"At that crisis, I ordered the bayonet. The word was enough.\" While battlefield conditions make it unlikely that many men heard Chamberlain's order, most historians believe he initiated the charge.\n\nThe 20th Maine charged down the hill, with the left wing wheeling continually to make the charging line swing like a hinge, thus creating a simultaneous [[frontal assault]] and [[flanking maneuver]], capturing 101 of the Confederate soldiers and successfully saving the flank. This version of the battle was popularized by the book ''[[The Killer Angels]]'' and the movie ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', but there is debate on the historical validity of this account.<ref>{{cite book|last=Desjardin|first=Thomas|title=Stand Firm Ye Boys From Maine|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-538231-0}}</ref> Chamberlain sustained two slight wounds in the battle, one when a shot hit his sword scabbard and bruised his thigh, and another when his right foot was hit by a spent bullet or piece of shrapnel. Chamberlain also personally took a Confederate prisoner with his saber during the charge. After initiating the maneuver, he came upon a Confederate officer wielding a revolver who quickly fired, narrowly missing his face. Chamberlain remained steadfast, and with his sword at the officer's throat accepted the man's arms and surrender.<ref>http://scienceviews.com/parks/chamberlain.html</ref> The pistol Chamberlain captured at Gettysburg can still be seen on display in the Civil War exhibit of the [[Maine State Museum]]. For his tenacity at defending Little Round Top, he was known by the sobriquet ''Lion of the Round Top.'' Prior to the battle, Chamberlain was quite ill, developing malaria and dysentery. Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered.\n\nFor his \"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top\", Chamberlain was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n=====Medal of Honor citation=====\n{{quote|The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 2 July 1863, while serving with 20th Maine Infantry, in action at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valor awards for Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=2140|website=Hall of Valor|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n====Siege of Petersburg====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn April 1864, Chamberlain returned to the Army of the Potomac and was promoted to brigade commander shortly before the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and given command of the 1st Brigade, First Division, V Corps. In a major action on June 18, during the [[Second Battle of Petersburg]], Chamberlain was shot through the right hip and groin, the bullet exiting his left hip. Despite the injury, Chamberlain withdrew his sword and stuck it into the ground in order to keep himself upright to dissuade the growing resolve for retreat. He stood upright for several minutes until he collapsed and lay unconscious from loss of blood. The wound was considered mortal by the division's surgeon, who predicted he would perish; Chamberlain's incorrectly recorded death in battle was reported in the Maine newspapers, and Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gave Chamberlain a battlefield promotion to the rank of brigadier general after receiving an urgent recommendation on June 19 from corps commander Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren: \"He has been recommended for promotion for gallant and efficient conduct on previous occasion and yesterday led his brigade against the enemy under most destructive fire. He expresses the wish that he may receive the recognition of his services by promotion before he dies for the gratification of his family and friends.\" Not expected to live, Chamberlain displayed surprising will and courage, and with the support of his brother Tom, was back in command by November. Although many, including his wife Fanny, urged Chamberlain to resign, he was determined to serve through the end of the war.\n\nIn early 1865, Chamberlain regained command of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of V Corps, and he continued to act with courage and resolve. On March 29, 1865, his brigade participated in a major skirmish on the Quaker Road during Grant's final advance that would finish the war. Despite losses, another wound (in the left arm and chest that almost caused amputation), and nearly being captured, Chamberlain was successful and brevetted to the rank of major general by President Abraham Lincoln. Chamberlain gained the name \"Bloody Chamberlain\" at Quaker Road. Chamberlain kept a Bible and framed picture of his wife in his left front \"chest\" pocket. A Confederate shot at Chamberlain. The bullet went through his horse's neck, hit the picture frame, entered under Chamberlain's skin in the front of his chest, traveled around his body under the skin along the rib, and exited his back. To all observers Union and Confederate, it appeared that he was shot through his chest. He continued to encourage his men to attack. All sides cheered his valiant courage, and the Union assault was successful.\n\n====Appomattox====\n[[File:Jbgordon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Confederate General John B. Gordon was assigned the task to surrender all arms to Gen. Chamberlain.]]\nOn the morning of April 9, 1865, Chamberlain learned of the desire by General [[Robert E. Lee]] to surrender the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] when a Confederate staff officer approached him under a flag of truce. \"Sir,\" he reported to Chamberlain, \"I am from [[John Brown Gordon|General Gordon]]. General Lee desires a cessation of hostilities until he can hear from General Grant as to the proposed surrender.\"<ref>Longacre, p. 243.</ref> The next day, Chamberlain was summoned to Union headquarters where Maj. Gen. [[Charles Griffin]] informed him that he had been selected to preside over the parade of the Confederate infantry as part of their formal surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 12.<ref>Desjardins, p. 118, states that General Grant personally selected Chamberlain from all of the officers in the army. Marvel, pp. 259-60, attributes the Grant story to Chamberlain's memory in the \"dim, distant light of old age.\" Longacre, pp. 244-47, does not connect General Grant directly to the choice of Chamberlain, and further states that \"By the turn of the 20th century, after Chamberlain had commemorated the surrender parade in numerous speeches and publications, some of the Union participants would quarrel with his presentation of events. They would charge him with making it appear that his brigade alone took part in the ceremony, ignoring other elements of the Fifth Corps also present for Gordon's surrender as well as to receive the surrender of General Longstreet's corps that same afternoon. These critics would also charge Chamberlain with implying that he had received arms and flags throughout morning and afternoon instead of during only a portion of the day as evidence suggested. Other veterans would claim that General Bartlett, not Chamberlain, had been Grant's choice to preside at the parade and that Chamberlain took over only because his superior was summoned elsewhere at the last minute. Critics of a later day would even deny that Chamberlain and Gordon had exchanged salutes of honor.\"</ref>\n\nThus Chamberlain was responsible for one of the most poignant scenes of the American Civil War. As the Confederate soldiers marched down the road to surrender their arms and colors, Chamberlain, on his own initiative, ordered his men to come to attention and \"carry arms\" as a show of respect. In memoirs written forty years after the event, Chamberlain described what happened next:\n\n{{quote|Gordon, at the head of the marching column, outdoes us in courtesy. He was riding with downcast eyes and more than pensive look; but at this clatter of arms he raises his eyes and instantly catching the significance, wheels his horse with that superb grace of which he is master, drops the point of his sword to his stirrup, gives a command, at which the great Confederate ensign following him is dipped and his decimated brigades, as they reach our right, respond to the 'carry.' All the while on our part not a sound of trumpet or drum, not a cheer, nor a word nor motion of man, but awful stillness as if it were the passing of the dead.<ref>Chamberlain, p. 196.</ref>}}\n\nChamberlain stated that his [[salute]] to the Confederate soldiers was unpopular with many Unionists, but he defended his action in his memoirs, ''[[The Passing of the Armies]]''. Many years later, Gordon, in his own memoirs, called Chamberlain \"one of the knightliest soldiers of the Federal Army.\" Gordon never mentioned the anecdote until after he read Chamberlain's account, more than 40 years later.<ref>Marvel, p. 261.</ref>\n\nIn all, Chamberlain served in 20 battles and numerous skirmishes, was cited for bravery four times, had six horses shot from under him, and was wounded six times.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Editorial|date=April 2017|title=Four Years, Five Wounds|url=|journal=Civil War Times|volume=56|pages=|via=Academic Search Ultimate}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/62875191.pdf|title=The Practice of Leadership: The Life and Times of Joshua L.

His victory in 1866 set the record for the most votes and the highest percentage for any Maine governor by that time. He would break his own record in 1868.

In 1871, he was appointed president of Bowdoin and remained in that position until 1883, when he was forced to resign because of ill health from his war wounds. He also served as an ex-officio trustee of nearby [[Bates College]] from 1867 to 1871.\n\nIn January 1880, there was a dispute about who was the newly elected governor of Maine, and the [[Maine State House]] was occupied by a band of armed men. The outgoing governor, [[Alonzo Garcelon]], summoned Chamberlain, the commander of the Maine Militia, to take charge. Chamberlain sent home the armed men, and arranged for the Augusta police to keep control. He stayed in the State House most of the twelve-day period until the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]'s decision on the election results was known. During this time, there were threats of assassination and kidnapping, and on one occasion, he went outside to face down a crowd of 25\u201330 men intending to kill him, and both sides offered bribes to appoint him a United States senator. Having gratified neither side in the dispute, he did not become a senator, and his career in state politics ended.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter resigning from Bowdoin in 1883, he went to [[New York City]] to practice law.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Chamberlain, Joshua Lawrence}}</ref><ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Chamberlain, Joshua Lawrence |year=1905}}</ref> Chamberlain served as Surveyor of the Port of [[Portland, Maine]], a federal appointment, and engaged in business activities, including real estate dealings in [[Florida]] (1885) and a college of art in New York, as well as hotels.

The citation commends him for his \"Daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.\" As in many other Civil War actions, controversy arose when one of his subordinate officers stated that Chamberlain never actually ordered a charge at Gettysburg. The claim never seriously affected Chamberlain's fame or notability however.

Lee; that in Gettysburg he gained the Little Round Top for the Confederacy, fighting against his own brother Tom commanding the 20th Maine; that thereby Chamberlain won the battle and the entire war for the Confederacy; that he later remained in the independent Confederacy and was eventually elected its President; and that his reconciliatory attitude towards the North led to Confederacy and the United States eventually holding referendums and freely deciding to re-unite in 1914, following Chamberlain's death.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n* [[List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Battle of Gettysburg]]\n* [[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A\u2013F]]\n* [[List of American Civil War generals (Union)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===References===\n*{{cite web\n |accessdate=July 13, 2010\n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html\n |title= Civil War (A-L); Chamberlain, Joshua entry\n |work= Medal of Honor recipients\n |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n |date= August 6, 2009\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Chamberlain\n |first=Joshua L.\n |title=The Passing of the Armies: An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps\n |year=1992\n |publisher=Bantam\n |isbn=978-0-553-29992-2\n |url-access=registration\n |url=https://archive.org/details/passingofarmiesa0000cham\n }}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Chase\n |first=Henry\n |title=Representative Men of Maine\n |url=https://archive.org/details/representativem00unkngoog\n |year=1893\n |publisher=The Lakeside Press\n |location=[[Portland, Maine]]}}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Desjardin\n |first=Thomas A.\n |title=Stand Firm Ye Boys from Maine: The 20th Maine and the Gettysburg Campaign\n |year=1995\n |publisher=Thomas Publications\n |isbn=978-1-57747-034-2}}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Eicher\n |first=John H.\n |author2=David J.

He became a highly respected and decorated Union [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], reaching the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] (and [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]]). He is best known for his gallantry at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], for which he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. Following the war, he served as [[Governor of Maine]], and the President of [[Bowdoin College]].\n\nChamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] in 1862 and fought at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. He became commander of the regiment in June 1863. On July 2, during the Battle of Gettysburg, Chamberlain's regiment occupied the extreme left of the Union lines at [[Little Round Top]]. Chamberlain's men withstood repeated assaults from the [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry]] and finally drove the Confederates away with a downhill bayonet charge. Chamberlain was severely wounded while commanding a brigade during the [[Second Battle of Petersburg]] in June 1864, and was given what was intended to be a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. In April 1865, he fought at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and was given the honor of commanding the Union troops at the surrender ceremony for the infantry of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia|Army]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia.\n\nAfter the war, he entered politics as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and served four one-year terms of office as the [[List of Governors of Maine|32nd Governor of Maine]]. He served on the faculty, and as president, of his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Bowdoin College]]. He died in 1914 at age 85 due to complications from the wound that he received at Petersburg.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nChamberlain was born in [[Brewer, Maine]], the son of Sarah Dupee (n\u00e9e Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain, on September 8, 1828.  Chamberlain was of English ancestry and could trace his family line back to twelfth-century England, during the reign of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>''Soul of the Lion: A Biography of General Joshua L. Chamberlain'' by Willard M. Wallce, pg.17</ref> He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from college. He entered [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], in 1848 with the help of local tutor and professor, William Hyde.  Chamberlain learned to read [[Ancient Greek]] and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was being published in serial form in the abolitionist paper, ''[[The National Era]]''. He also joined the [[Peucinian Society]], a group of students with [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] leanings. A member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society and a brother of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852.\n \nChamberlain married [[Fanny Chamberlain|Fanny Adams]], cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of who was born too premature to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at [[Bangor Theological Seminary]] in [[Bangor, Maine]], returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a [[professor]] of [[rhetoric]]. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and [[mathematics]]. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages.<ref>Chase, p. 63.</ref> He was fluent in nine languages other than English: [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].\n\nChamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the [[Siege of Yorktown]].  His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the [[War of 1812]] and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating [[Battle of Hampden]], which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces. His father also had served during the abortive [[Aroostook War]] of 1839.\n\n==American Civil War==\n===Early career===\n[[File:Thomas D Chamberlain.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Chamberlain's younger brother, Thomas, who was the Lieutenant Colonel of the 20th Maine]]\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Chamberlain believed the Union needed to be supported against the Confederacy by all those willing. On several occasions, Chamberlain spoke freely of his beliefs during his class, urging students to follow their hearts in regards to the war while maintaining that the cause was just. Of his desire to serve in the War, he wrote to Maine's Governor [[Israel Washburn, Jr.]], \"I fear, this war, so costly of blood and treasure, will not cease until men of the North are willing to leave good positions, and sacrifice the dearest personal interests, to rescue our country from desolation, and defend the national existence against treachery.\"<ref>As cited in: Thomas A. Desjardin, ''Joshua L. Chamberlain'', Greystone Communication, 1999, p. 22.</ref> Many faculty at Bowdoin did not feel his enthusiasm for various reasons and Chamberlain was subsequently granted a leave of absence (supposedly to study languages for two years in [[Europe]]). He then promptly enlisted unbeknownst to those at Bowdoin and his family. Offered the [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]cy of the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine Regiment]], he declined, according to his biographer, John J. Pullen, preferring to \"start a little lower and learn the business first.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He was appointed [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the regiment on August 8, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Adelbert Ames]]. The 20th was assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] in the Union [[Army of the Potomac]].  One of Chamberlain's younger brothers, [[Thomas Chamberlain (soldier)|Thomas Chamberlain]], was also an officer of the 20th Maine, and another, John Chamberlain, visited the regiment at Gettysburg as a member of the [[U.S. Christian Commission]] until appointed as a chaplain in another Maine Volunteer regiment.\nThe 20th Maine fought at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], suffering relatively small numbers of casualties in the assaults on Marye's Heights, but were forced to spend a miserable night on the freezing battlefield among the many wounded from other regiments. Chamberlain chronicled this night well in his diary and went to great length discussing his having to use bodies of the fallen for shelter and a pillow while listening to the bullets zip into the corpses.\nThe 20th missed the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863 due to an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in their ranks (which was caused by an errant smallpox vaccine), keeping them on guard duty in the rear.<ref>Desjardin, pp. 4-5.</ref> Chamberlain was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the regiment in June 1863 upon the promotion of Ames.\n\n====Battle of Gettysburg====\n[[File:Ellis Spear - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Capt. [[Ellis Spear]], Chamberlain's \"right-hand man\" on Little Round Top]]\n[[File:Little Round Top1.png|thumb|right|250px|Chamberlain's position on Little Round Top]]\n[[File:Little Round Top 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Little Round Top, western slope, photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], 1863]]\n\nChamberlain became most famous for his achievements during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. On July 2, the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day|second day of the battle]], Union forces were recovering from initial setbacks and hastily regrouping into defensive positions on a line of hills south of the town. Sensing the momentary vulnerability of the Union forces, the Confederates began an attack against the Union left flank. Chamberlain's brigade, commanded by Col. [[Strong Vincent]], was sent to defend [[Little Round Top]] by the army's Chief of Engineers, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]]. Chamberlain found himself and the 20th Maine at the far left end of the entire Union line. He quickly understood the strategic significance of the small hill, and the need for the 20th Maine to hold the Union left at all costs. The men from Maine waited until troops from the [[15th Regiment Alabama Infantry]], commanded by Col. [[William C. Oates]], charged up the hill, attempting to flank the Union position. Time and time again the Confederates struck, until the 20th Maine was almost doubled back upon itself. With many casualties and ammunition running low, Col. Chamberlain recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing (which was now looking southeast, compared to the rest of the regiment, which was facing west) to initiate a bayonet charge. From his report of the day: \"At that crisis, I ordered the bayonet. The word was enough.\" While battlefield conditions make it unlikely that many men heard Chamberlain's order, most historians believe he initiated the charge.\n\nThe 20th Maine charged down the hill, with the left wing wheeling continually to make the charging line swing like a hinge, thus creating a simultaneous [[frontal assault]] and [[flanking maneuver]], capturing 101 of the Confederate soldiers and successfully saving the flank. This version of the battle was popularized by the book ''[[The Killer Angels]]'' and the movie ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', but there is debate on the historical validity of this account.<ref>{{cite book|last=Desjardin|first=Thomas|title=Stand Firm Ye Boys From Maine|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-538231-0}}</ref> Chamberlain sustained two slight wounds in the battle, one when a shot hit his sword scabbard and bruised his thigh, and another when his right foot was hit by a spent bullet or piece of shrapnel. Chamberlain also personally took a Confederate prisoner with his saber during the charge. After initiating the maneuver, he came upon a Confederate officer wielding a revolver who quickly fired, narrowly missing his face. Chamberlain remained steadfast, and with his sword at the officer's throat accepted the man's arms and surrender.<ref>http://scienceviews.com/parks/chamberlain.html</ref> The pistol Chamberlain captured at Gettysburg can still be seen on display in the Civil War exhibit of the [[Maine State Museum]]. For his tenacity at defending Little Round Top, he was known by the sobriquet ''Lion of the Round Top.'' Prior to the battle, Chamberlain was quite ill, developing malaria and dysentery. Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered.\n\nFor his \"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top\", Chamberlain was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n=====Medal of Honor citation=====\n{{quote|The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 2 July 1863, while serving with 20th Maine Infantry, in action at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valor awards for Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=2140|website=Hall of Valor|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n====Siege of Petersburg====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn April 1864, Chamberlain returned to the Army of the Potomac and was promoted to brigade commander shortly before the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and given command of the 1st Brigade, First Division, V Corps. In a major action on June 18, during the [[Second Battle of Petersburg]], Chamberlain was shot through the right hip and groin, the bullet exiting his left hip. Despite the injury, Chamberlain withdrew his sword and stuck it into the ground in order to keep himself upright to dissuade the growing resolve for retreat. He stood upright for several minutes until he collapsed and lay unconscious from loss of blood. The wound was considered mortal by the division's surgeon, who predicted he would perish; Chamberlain's incorrectly recorded death in battle was reported in the Maine newspapers, and Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gave Chamberlain a battlefield promotion to the rank of brigadier general after receiving an urgent recommendation on June 19 from corps commander Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren: \"He has been recommended for promotion for gallant and efficient conduct on previous occasion and yesterday led his brigade against the enemy under most destructive fire. He expresses the wish that he may receive the recognition of his services by promotion before he dies for the gratification of his family and friends.\" Not expected to live, Chamberlain displayed surprising will and courage, and with the support of his brother Tom, was back in command by November. Although many, including his wife Fanny, urged Chamberlain to resign, he was determined to serve through the end of the war.\n\nIn early 1865, Chamberlain regained command of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of V Corps, and he continued to act with courage and resolve. On March 29, 1865, his brigade participated in a major skirmish on the Quaker Road during Grant's final advance that would finish the war. Despite losses, another wound (in the left arm and chest that almost caused amputation), and nearly being captured, Chamberlain was successful and brevetted to the rank of major general by President Abraham Lincoln. Chamberlain gained the name \"Bloody Chamberlain\" at Quaker Road. Chamberlain kept a Bible and framed picture of his wife in his left front \"chest\" pocket. A Confederate shot at Chamberlain. The bullet went through his horse's neck, hit the picture frame, entered under Chamberlain's skin in the front of his chest, traveled around his body under the skin along the rib, and exited his back. To all observers Union and Confederate, it appeared that he was shot through his chest. He continued to encourage his men to attack. All sides cheered his valiant courage, and the Union assault was successful.\n\n====Appomattox====\n[[File:Jbgordon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Confederate General John B. Gordon was assigned the task to surrender all arms to Gen. Chamberlain.]]\nOn the morning of April 9, 1865, Chamberlain learned of the desire by General [[Robert E. Lee]] to surrender the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] when a Confederate staff officer approached him under a flag of truce. \"Sir,\" he reported to Chamberlain, \"I am from [[John Brown Gordon|General Gordon]]. General Lee desires a cessation of hostilities until he can hear from General Grant as to the proposed surrender.\"<ref>Longacre, p. 243.</ref> The next day, Chamberlain was summoned to Union headquarters where Maj. Gen. [[Charles Griffin]] informed him that he had been selected to preside over the parade of the Confederate infantry as part of their formal surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 12.<ref>Desjardins, p. 118, states that General Grant personally selected Chamberlain from all of the officers in the army. Marvel, pp. 259-60, attributes the Grant story to Chamberlain's memory in the \"dim, distant light of old age.\" Longacre, pp. 244-47, does not connect General Grant directly to the choice of Chamberlain, and further states that \"By the turn of the 20th century, after Chamberlain had commemorated the surrender parade in numerous speeches and publications, some of the Union participants would quarrel with his presentation of events. They would charge him with making it appear that his brigade alone took part in the ceremony, ignoring other elements of the Fifth Corps also present for Gordon's surrender as well as to receive the surrender of General Longstreet's corps that same afternoon. These critics would also charge Chamberlain with implying that he had received arms and flags throughout morning and afternoon instead of during only a portion of the day as evidence suggested. Other veterans would claim that General Bartlett, not Chamberlain, had been Grant's choice to preside at the parade and that Chamberlain took over only because his superior was summoned elsewhere at the last minute. Critics of a later day would even deny that Chamberlain and Gordon had exchanged salutes of honor.\"</ref>\n\nThus Chamberlain was responsible for one of the most poignant scenes of the American Civil War. As the Confederate soldiers marched down the road to surrender their arms and colors, Chamberlain, on his own initiative, ordered his men to come to attention and \"carry arms\" as a show of respect. In memoirs written forty years after the event, Chamberlain described what happened next:\n\n{{quote|Gordon, at the head of the marching column, outdoes us in courtesy. He was riding with downcast eyes and more than pensive look; but at this clatter of arms he raises his eyes and instantly catching the significance, wheels his horse with that superb grace of which he is master, drops the point of his sword to his stirrup, gives a command, at which the great Confederate ensign following him is dipped and his decimated brigades, as they reach our right, respond to the 'carry.' All the while on our part not a sound of trumpet or drum, not a cheer, nor a word nor motion of man, but awful stillness as if it were the passing of the dead.<ref>Chamberlain, p. 196.</ref>}}\n\nChamberlain stated that his [[salute]] to the Confederate soldiers was unpopular with many Unionists, but he defended his action in his memoirs, ''[[The Passing of the Armies]]''. Many years later, Gordon, in his own memoirs, called Chamberlain \"one of the knightliest soldiers of the Federal Army.\" Gordon never mentioned the anecdote until after he read Chamberlain's account, more than 40 years later.<ref>Marvel, p. 261.</ref>\n\nIn all, Chamberlain served in 20 battles and numerous skirmishes, was cited for bravery four times, had six horses shot from under him, and was wounded six times.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Editorial|date=April 2017|title=Four Years, Five Wounds|url=|journal=Civil War Times|volume=56|pages=|via=Academic Search Ultimate}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/62875191.pdf|title=The Practice of Leadership: The Life and Times of Joshua L.

His victory in 1866 set the record for the most votes and the highest percentage for any Maine governor by that time. He would break his own record in 1868.

In 1871, he was appointed president of Bowdoin and remained in that position until 1883, when he was forced to resign because of ill health from his war wounds. He also served as an ex-officio trustee of nearby [[Bates College]] from 1867 to 1871.\n\nIn January 1880, there was a dispute about who was the newly elected governor of Maine, and the [[Maine State House]] was occupied by a band of armed men. The outgoing governor, [[Alonzo Garcelon]], summoned Chamberlain, the commander of the Maine Militia, to take charge. Chamberlain sent home the armed men, and arranged for the Augusta police to keep control. He stayed in the State House most of the twelve-day period until the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]'s decision on the election results was known. During this time, there were threats of assassination and kidnapping, and on one occasion, he went outside to face down a crowd of 25\u201330 men intending to kill him, and both sides offered bribes to appoint him a United States senator. Having gratified neither side in the dispute, he did not become a senator, and his career in state politics ended.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter resigning from Bowdoin in 1883, he went to [[New York City]] to practice law.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Chamberlain, Joshua Lawrence}}</ref><ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Chamberlain, Joshua Lawrence |year=1905}}</ref> Chamberlain served as Surveyor of the Port of [[Portland, Maine]], a federal appointment, and engaged in business activities, including real estate dealings in [[Florida]] (1885) and a college of art in New York, as well as hotels. He traveled to the [[United States West Coast|West Coast]] to work on railroad building and public improvements.<ref name=ea /> From the time of his serious wound in 1864 until his death, he was forced to wear an early form of a [[catheter]] with a bag and underwent six operations to try to correct the original wound and stop the fevers and infections that plagued him, without success.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in full uniform.jpg|thumb|Chamberlain later in life in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], wearing uniform and his medals]]\nIn 1893, 30 years after the battle that made the 20th Maine famous, Chamberlain was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at Gettysburg. The citation commends him for his \"Daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.\" As in many other Civil War actions, controversy arose when one of his subordinate officers stated that Chamberlain never actually ordered a charge at Gettysburg. The claim never seriously affected Chamberlain's fame or notability however. This original medal was lost, and later rediscovered in 2013, and donated to the Pejebscot Historical Society in Brunswick, Maine.

Despite continual pain and discomfort from his wounds of 1864, he made many return visits to Gettysburg and delivered speeches at soldiers' reunions. He made his last known visit on May 16 and 17, 1913, while involved in planning the 50th anniversary reunion. Because of deteriorating health, he was unable to attend the reunion less than two months later.<ref>[http://gettysburg1913.wordpress.com/2013/04/06/joshua-lawrence-chamberlain-and-the-great-reunion/ \"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the Great Reunion\"], worldpress.com, April 6, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nChamberlain died of his lingering wartime wounds in 1914 in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], Maine, at the age of eighty-five.
