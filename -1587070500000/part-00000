It replaced the procedure provided in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]], by which the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] originally functioned. The amendment was proposed by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] on December 9, 1803, and was ratified by the requisite three-fourths of [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] on June 15, 1804. The new rules took effect for the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]] and have governed all subsequent presidential elections.\n\nUnder the original rules of the Constitution, each member of the Electoral College cast two electoral votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. The presidential candidate receiving the greatest number of votes\u2014provided that number equaled a majority of the electors\u2014was elected president, while the presidential candidate receiving the second-most votes was elected vice president. In cases where no individual won a vote from a majority of the electors, as well in cases where multiple individuals won votes from a majority of electors but tied each other for the most votes, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] would hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president. In cases where multiple candidates tied for the second-most votes, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] would hold a contingent election to select the vice president. The first four presidential elections were conducted under these rules.\n\nThe experiences of the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential elections]] spurred legislators to amend the presidential election process, requiring each member of the Electoral College to cast one electoral vote for president and one electoral vote for vice president. Under the new rules, a contingent election is still held by the House of Representatives if no candidate wins a presidential electoral vote from a majority of the electors, but there is no longer any possibility of multiple candidates winning presidential electoral votes from a majority of electors. The Twelfth Amendment also lowered the number of candidates eligible to be selected by the House in a presidential contingent election from five to three, established that the Senate would hold a contingent election for vice president if no candidate won a majority of the vice presidential electoral vote, and provided that no individual constitutionally ineligible to the office of president would be eligible to serve as vice president.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;\n\nThe President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and  House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;\n\nThe person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. ''And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President''.{{efn|''('''Note:''' This provision was superseded by Sections 1 and 3 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] in 1933.)''}}\n\nThe person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

The two people chosen by the elector could not both inhabit the same state as that elector. This prohibition was designed to keep electors from voting for two \"[[favorite son]]s\" of their respective states.<ref>[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php The Electoral College \u2013 Origin and History] Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections</ref> The person receiving the greatest number of votes, provided that number constituted a [[majority]] of the electors, was elected president, while the presidential candidate receiving the second-most votes was elected vice president.\n\nIn the cases where no candidate won a majority of electoral votes the House of Representatives would hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president. If there were more than one individual who received the same number of votes, and such number equaled a majority of the electors, the House would choose one of them to be president. If no individual had a majority, then the House would choose from the five individuals with the greatest number of electoral votes. In both sets of circumstances, each state delegation had one ({{Linktext|en bloc}}) vote. A candidate was required to receive an [[absolute majority]], more than half of the total number of states, in order to be chosen as president.\n\nSelecting the vice president was a simpler process. Whichever candidate received the second greatest number of votes for president became vice president. The vice president, unlike the president, was not required to receive votes from a majority of the electors. In the event of a tie for second place, the Senate would hold a contingent election to select the vice president from those tied, with each senator casting one vote. A candidate was required to receive an absolute majority, more than half of the total Senate membership, in order to be chosen as vice president.\n\nThe original electoral system worked adequately for the first two presidential elections because on both occasions [[George Washington]] was the unanimous choice of the electors for president; the only real contest was the election for vice president for which an overall majority was not required. George Washington's decision not to seek a third term and the emergence of partisan political activity exposed problems with the original procedure.\n\nIn the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]], [[John Adams]], the [[Federalist Party]] presidential candidate, received a majority of the electoral votes. However, the Federalist electors scattered their second votes, resulting in the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] presidential candidate, [[Thomas Jefferson]], receiving the second highest number of electoral votes and thus being elected vice president. It soon became apparent that having a vice president and a president unwilling to work together effectively was going to be a more significant problem than was originally realized. The most significant problem was that with the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] raging in Europe, it was immediately apparent that President Adams was going to pursue a pro-British foreign policy, much to the disgust of the strongly pro-French Vice President Jefferson.\n\nBoth major parties attempted to remedy the situation by having the president and vice president elected on a party [[Ticket (election)|ticket]]. This solution significantly enhanced the likelihood of having political allies serving as president and vice president but raised a different flaw in the arrangements.\n\nOn January 6, 1797, Federalist Representative [[William Loughton Smith|William L. Smith]] of South Carolina responded to the 1796 result by presenting a resolution on the floor of the House of Representatives for an amendment to the Constitution requiring each elector to cast one vote for president and another for vice president.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Congress|others=4th Congress, 2nd Session|title=Annals of Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=006/llac006.db&recNum=154|accessdate=June 26, 2006|year=1797|page=1824}}</ref> However, no action was taken on his proposal, setting the stage for the deadlocked election of 1800.\n\nThe [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 election]] exposed a defect in the original formula in that if each member of the Electoral College followed party tickets, there could be a tie between the two candidates from the most popular ticket. Both parties planned to prevent this by having one of their electors abstain from voting for the vice presidential candidate to ensure a clear result. Jefferson managed to secure a majority of pledged electors, but the margin in 1800 was so slim that there was little room for error if the Democratic-Republicans were to avoid repeating the Federalists' miscues of 1796. Given the technical limitations of 18th-century communications, Democratic-Republicans electors in all states were left to assume that an elector in another state was the one responsible for casting the one abstention necessary to ensure the election of unofficial vice presidential nominee [[Aaron Burr]] to that office. All Democratic-Republicans electors in each state were so reluctant to be seen as the one responsible for causing outgoing President Adams to be elected as vice president that every Democratic-Republican elector cast a vote for both Jefferson and Burr, resulting in a tie.\n\nConsequently, a contingent presidential election was held in the House of Representatives. Federalist-controlled state delegations cast their votes for Burr in an effort to prevent Jefferson from becoming president. Neither Burr nor Jefferson was able to win on the first 35 ballots. With help from [[Alexander Hamilton]], the gridlock was finally broken on the 36th ballot and Jefferson was elected president on February 17, 1801.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815|last=Wood|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|location=New York|pages=285}}</ref> This prolonged contingent election, combined with the increasing Democratic-Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate, led to a consequential change in the nation's frame of government, the requirement of separate votes for president and vice president in the Electoral College.\n\n==Adoption==\n===Journey to Congress===\nIn March 1801, weeks after the election of 1800 was resolved, two amendments were proposed in the New York state legislature that would form the skeleton of the Twelfth Amendment. Governor John Jay submitted an amendment to the state legislature that would require a district election of electors in each state. Assemblyman [[Jedediah Peck]] submitted an amendment to adopt designations for the votes for president and vice president. The two amendments were not considered until early 1802 because the state legislature took a break for the summer and winter. New York state senator DeWitt Clinton moved for the adoption of the amendment in January 1802. Shortly thereafter, Clinton won a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in bringing the designation amendment to Congress. The process continued in New York on February 15 when Representative Benjamin Walker of New York proposed the designation and district election amendments to the House. Debate on the amendments began in May. The Republicans wanted to decide on the amendment quickly, but the Federalists argued that the ideas needed more time than the current session allowed. Federalist Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut wanted to examine the necessity of a vice president. The amendment ultimately failed in the New York State Senate, but DeWitt Clinton brought the amendment discussion to the House of Representatives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT}}</ref>\n\nCongress was ready to debate the presented amendment, but the Democratic-Republicans decided to wait for the [[8th United States Congress|8th Congress]]. The 8th Congress would allow the Democratic-Republicans a better chance of meeting the two-thirds vote requirement for submitting a proposed Constitutional amendment.\n\n===Congressional debate===\nOn its first day, the 8th Congress considered the designation amendment. The first formulation of the amendment had the five highest electoral vote earners on the ballot in the House if no one candidate had a majority of the electoral votes. Republican [[John Clopton]] of Virginia, the largest state in the Union, argued that having five names on the list for a contingency election took the power from the people, so he proposed that there be only two names on the list. On October 20, the House appointed a seventeen-member committee (one Representative from each state) to fine-tune the amendment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=127\u2013128}}</ref>\n\nThe original proposal starting in the New York state legislature would have, along with designation, put forward the idea of the district election of electors that Treasury Secretary Gallatin had supported. Shortly after the committee was formed, Federalist [[Benjamin Huger (congressman)|Benjamin Huger]] attempted to add a provision regarding district elections to the proposed amendment, but the committee ignored him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=128}}</ref>\n\nThe committee then submitted an updated version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the vice president if there were a tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three because it made it far less likely that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist [[Gaylord Griswold]] argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the president. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNext up for the Federalists was [[Seth Hastings]] of Massachusetts, who submitted the argument that the designation amendment rendered the vice presidency useless and advocated for the elimination of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]]. [[John Cotton Smith|John C. Smith]] asked the inflammatory question of whether the proposed amendment was to help Jefferson get reelected. Speaker [[Nathaniel Macon]] called this inappropriate. After [[Matthew Lyon]] of Kentucky denounced any reference to the three-fifths clause as mere provocation, the House easily passed the resolution 88\u201339 on October 28.\n\nBy October 28, the Senate had already been discussing the designation amendment. Republican [[DeWitt Clinton]] expected that the Senate, with a 24\u20139 Republican majority would quickly pass the amendment. Federalist [[Jonathan Dayton]] proposed that the office of the vice president should be eliminated and his colleague, [[Uriah Tracy]], seconded it. On the other side, [[Wilson Cary Nicholas]] was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas' concern, the Senate would not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nMuch as it had in the House, debate centered around the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator [[Pierce Butler]] of South Carolina argued that the issues with the election of 1800 were unlikely to happen again and he would not advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist vice president. [[John Quincy Adams]] argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the president balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of president and vice president would tip that scale in favor of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=136\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nFederalist senators argued for retaining the original procedure for the Electoral College. Senator [[Samuel White (American politician)|Samuel White]] of Delaware claimed that the original procedure had not been given \"a fair experiment\" and criticized the proposed amendment for entrenching the [[two-party system]] that had taken over presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomformula.us/articles/a-far-superior-method/|title=A Far Superior Method\u2014the Original Electoral College|last=Alder|first=Carolyn|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Freedom Formula|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Republicans appealed to democratic principles. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]] of Maryland argued that the presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because it would otherwise be possible to have the fifth best candidate become president. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the House of Representatives, and the president is then much more likely to be the people's choice. Another of Smith's arguments was simply the election of 1800. [[William Cocke]] of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=137}}</ref>\n\nOne last order of business for the amendment was to deal with the possibility that the House would fail to choose a president by March 4. It was the least controversial portion of the Twelfth Amendment and [[John Taylor of Caroline|John Taylor]] proposed that the vice president would take over as president in that peculiar occurrence, \"as in case of the death or other Constitutional disability of the President.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nIt seemed clear all along that the Republican dominance would render this a no-contest and the Republicans were just waiting for all of their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate, lasting from 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., was the order of the day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. Tracy claimed the original procedure was formulated to give the small states a chance to elect the vice president, who would be a check on the president's powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this only works if you make it partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Republican small state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=140\u2013141}}</ref>\n\n===Proposal and ratification===\n[[Image:12th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|upright=.90|thumb|The Twelfth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment was proposed by the [[8th United States Congress|8th Congress]] on December 9, 1803, when it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by vote of 84&ndash;42,<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Annals of Congress 775 (1805)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=013/llac013.db&recNum=385|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> having been previously passed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 22&ndash;10, on December 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Annals of Congress 209 (1805)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=013/llac013.db&recNum=102|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> The amendment was officially submitted to the states on December 12, 1803, and was [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratified]] by the [[State legislature (United States)|legislatures]] of the following states:<ref name=CUSA2017GPO>{{cite web|title=Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation|date=August 26, 2017|url=https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office, Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=28\u201330|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n# [[North Carolina]] (December 22, 1803)\n# [[Maryland]] (December 24, 1803)\n# [[Kentucky]] (December 27, 1803)\n# [[Ohio]] (December 30, 1803)\n# [[Pennsylvania]] (January 5, 1804)\n# [[Vermont]] (January 30, 1804)\n# [[Virginia]] (February 3, 1804)\n# [[New York (state)|New York]] (February 10, 1804)\n# [[New Jersey]] (February 22, 1804)\n# [[Rhode Island]] (March 12, 1804)\n# [[South Carolina]] (May 15, 1804)\n# [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (May 19, 1804)\n# [[New Hampshire]] (June 15, 1804)<br>Having been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (13 of 17), the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment was completed and it became a part of the Constitution.{{efn-ua|Rati\ufb01cation was probably completed on June 15, 1804, when the [[New Hampshire Legislature]] ratified the amendment.

The new electoral process was first used for the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]]. Each presidential election since has been conducted under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment.\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment stipulates that each elector must cast distinct votes for president and vice president, instead of two votes for president. Additionally, electors may not vote for presidential and vice-presidential candidates who both reside in the elector's state\u2014at least one of them must be an inhabitant of another state.\n\nIf no candidate for president has a majority of the total votes, the House of Representatives, voting by states and with the same [[quorum]] requirements as under the original procedure, chooses the president. The Twelfth Amendment requires the House to choose from the three highest receivers of electoral votes, compared to five under the original procedure.\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment requires a person to receive a majority of the electoral votes for vice president for that person to be elected vice president by the Electoral College. If no candidate for vice president has a majority of the total votes, the Senate, with each senator having one vote, chooses the vice president. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose between the candidates with the \"two highest numbers\" of electoral votes. If multiple individuals are tied for second place, the Senate may consider all of them, in addition to the individual with the greatest number of votes. The Twelfth Amendment introduced a quorum requirement of two-thirds of the whole number of senators for the conduct of balloting. Furthermore, the Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose a vice president by way of the affirmative votes of \"a majority of the whole number\" of senators.\n\nTo prevent deadlocks from keeping the nation leaderless, the Twelfth Amendment provided that if the House did not choose a president before March 4 (then the first day of a presidential term), the individual elected vice president would \"act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.\" The Twelfth Amendment did not state for how long the vice president would act as president or if the House could still choose a president after March 4. [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment]], adopted in 1933, supersedes that provision of the Twelfth Amendment by changing the date upon which a new presidential term commences to January 20, clarifying that the vice president-elect would only \"act as President\" if the House has not chosen a president by January 20, and permitting Congress to statutorily provide \"who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected\" if there is no president-elect or vice president-elect by January 20. It also clarifies that if there is no president-elect on January 20, whoever acts as president does so until a person \"qualified\" to occupy the presidency is elected to be president.\n\n===Interaction with the Twenty-second Amendment===\n{{See also|Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution#Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment}}\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment explicitly states the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|constitutional requirements as provided for the president]] also apply to being vice president. It is unclear whether a two-term president could later serve as vice president. Some contend that the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] and Twelfth Amendment both bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the [[United States presidential line of succession]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand|author=Matthew J.

Calhoun]] (the running mate of both Jackson and Adams) was elected outright with received 182 electoral votes.\n\nIn [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] nominated four different candidates in different regions, aiming to splinter the electoral vote while denying Democratic nominee [[Martin Van Buren]] an electoral majority and forcing a contingent election. \n\nThe Whig strategy narrowly failed as Van Buren won an electoral vote majority and an apparent popular vote majority, winning Pennsylvania by 4222 votes. (In South Carolina, whose presidential electors were Whigs, no popular vote was held as the state legislature chose the electors.)\n\nThe basis for the Whigs strategy lay in a severe state-level Democratic Party [[1835 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election|split]] in Pennsylvania that propelled the Whig-aligned [[Anti-Masonic Party]] to [[Political party strength in Pennsylvania|statewide power]]. Party alignments by state in the House of Representatives suggest that any contingent election would have had [[1834 and 1835 United States House of Representatives elections|an uncertain outcome]], with none of the candidates (Van Buren, William Henry Harrison and Hugh White) having a clear path to victory.\n\nIn that same election, no candidate for vice president secured an electoral majority as the Democratic electors from [[Virginia]] refused to vote for Democratic vice presidential nominee, [[Richard Mentor Johnson]], due to his relationship with a former slave, and instead cast their votes for [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]].\n\nAs a result, Johnson received 147 electoral votes, one vote short of a majority, followed by [[Francis Granger]] with 77, [[John Tyler]] with 47 and Smith with 23. Thus, it became necessary for the Senate to hold a contingent election between Johnson and Granger for vice president, which Johnson won on the first ballot with 33 votes to Granger's 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Richard_M_Johnson.htm|title=VP Richard Mentor Johnson|date=30 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 1836, no major U.S. party has nominated multiple regional presidential or vice presidential candidates in an election. However, since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], there have been two serious attempts by [[Southern United States|Southern]]-based parties to run regional candidates in hopes of denying either of the two major candidates an electoral college majority. Both attempts (in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]] and [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]) narrowly failed; in both cases, a shift in the result of two or three close states would have forced these respective elections into the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/teacher/campaign.htm|title=Student Activity: Presidential Campaign of 1948|publisher=Harry S.

A Habitation Clause issue arose during the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] contested by [[George W. Bush]] (running-mate [[Dick Cheney]]) and [[Al Gore]] (running-mate [[Joe Lieberman]]), because it was alleged that Bush and Cheney were both inhabitants of [[Texas]] and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Texas' 32 electoral votes were necessary in order to secure Bush and Cheney a majority in the Electoral College. With the Democrats [[2000 United States Senate elections|picking up four seats in the Senate]] to equal the Republicans at 50 seats each in the chamber, the outcome of a contingent election in the Senate, especially if it had happened after the newly elected senators had been seated, would have been far from certain; in fact such an election in 2000, had it happened, would have determined which party controlled the Senate.\n\nBush's residency was unquestioned, as he was [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor of Texas]] at the time. However, Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at [[Halliburton]]. Cheney had grown up in Wyoming, had represented it in Congress and had continuously maintained a residence in the state during his tenure at Halliburton. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to [[Wyoming]] and put his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], where it was dismissed.<ref>Bravin, Jess.

It replaced the procedure provided in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]], by which the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] originally functioned. The amendment was proposed by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] on December 9, 1803, and was ratified by the requisite three-fourths of [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] on June 15, 1804. The new rules took effect for the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]] and have governed all subsequent presidential elections.\n\nUnder the original rules of the Constitution, each member of the Electoral College cast two electoral votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. The presidential candidate receiving the greatest number of votes\u2014provided that number equaled a majority of the electors\u2014was elected president, while the presidential candidate receiving the second-most votes was elected vice president. In cases where no individual won a vote from a majority of the electors, as well in cases where multiple individuals won votes from a majority of electors but tied each other for the most votes, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] would hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president. In cases where multiple candidates tied for the second-most votes, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] would hold a contingent election to select the vice president. The first four presidential elections were conducted under these rules.\n\nThe experiences of the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential elections]] spurred legislators to amend the presidential election process, requiring each member of the Electoral College to cast one electoral vote for president and one electoral vote for vice president. Under the new rules, a contingent election is still held by the House of Representatives if no candidate wins a presidential electoral vote from a majority of the electors, but there is no longer any possibility of multiple candidates winning presidential electoral votes from a majority of electors. The Twelfth Amendment also lowered the number of candidates eligible to be selected by the House in a presidential contingent election from five to three, established that the Senate would hold a contingent election for vice president if no candidate won a majority of the vice presidential electoral vote, and provided that no individual constitutionally ineligible to the office of president would be eligible to serve as vice president.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;\n\nThe President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and  House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;\n\nThe person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President.

The two people chosen by the elector could not both inhabit the same state as that elector. This prohibition was designed to keep electors from voting for two \"[[favorite son]]s\" of their respective states.<ref>[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php The Electoral College \u2013 Origin and History] Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections</ref> The person receiving the greatest number of votes, provided that number constituted a [[majority]] of the electors, was elected president, while the presidential candidate receiving the second-most votes was elected vice president.\n\nIn the cases where no candidate won a majority of electoral votes the House of Representatives would hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president. If there were more than one individual who received the same number of votes, and such number equaled a majority of the electors, the House would choose one of them to be president. If no individual had a majority, then the House would choose from the five individuals with the greatest number of electoral votes. In both sets of circumstances, each state delegation had one ({{Linktext|en bloc}}) vote. A candidate was required to receive an [[absolute majority]], more than half of the total number of states, in order to be chosen as president.\n\nSelecting the vice president was a simpler process. Whichever candidate received the second greatest number of votes for president became vice president. The vice president, unlike the president, was not required to receive votes from a majority of the electors. In the event of a tie for second place, the Senate would hold a contingent election to select the vice president from those tied, with each senator casting one vote. A candidate was required to receive an absolute majority, more than half of the total Senate membership, in order to be chosen as vice president.\n\nThe original electoral system worked adequately for the first two presidential elections because on both occasions [[George Washington]] was the unanimous choice of the electors for president; the only real contest was the election for vice president for which an overall majority was not required. George Washington's decision not to seek a third term and the emergence of partisan political activity exposed problems with the original procedure.\n\nIn the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]], [[John Adams]], the [[Federalist Party]] presidential candidate, received a majority of the electoral votes. However, the Federalist electors scattered their second votes, resulting in the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] presidential candidate, [[Thomas Jefferson]], receiving the second highest number of electoral votes and thus being elected vice president. It soon became apparent that having a vice president and a president unwilling to work together effectively was going to be a more significant problem than was originally realized. The most significant problem was that with the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] raging in Europe, it was immediately apparent that President Adams was going to pursue a pro-British foreign policy, much to the disgust of the strongly pro-French Vice President Jefferson.\n\nBoth major parties attempted to remedy the situation by having the president and vice president elected on a party [[Ticket (election)|ticket]]. This solution significantly enhanced the likelihood of having political allies serving as president and vice president but raised a different flaw in the arrangements.\n\nOn January 6, 1797, Federalist Representative [[William Loughton Smith|William L. Smith]] of South Carolina responded to the 1796 result by presenting a resolution on the floor of the House of Representatives for an amendment to the Constitution requiring each elector to cast one vote for president and another for vice president.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Congress|others=4th Congress, 2nd Session|title=Annals of Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=006/llac006.db&recNum=154|accessdate=June 26, 2006|year=1797|page=1824}}</ref> However, no action was taken on his proposal, setting the stage for the deadlocked election of 1800.\n\nThe [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 election]] exposed a defect in the original formula in that if each member of the Electoral College followed party tickets, there could be a tie between the two candidates from the most popular ticket. Both parties planned to prevent this by having one of their electors abstain from voting for the vice presidential candidate to ensure a clear result. Jefferson managed to secure a majority of pledged electors, but the margin in 1800 was so slim that there was little room for error if the Democratic-Republicans were to avoid repeating the Federalists' miscues of 1796. Given the technical limitations of 18th-century communications, Democratic-Republicans electors in all states were left to assume that an elector in another state was the one responsible for casting the one abstention necessary to ensure the election of unofficial vice presidential nominee [[Aaron Burr]] to that office. All Democratic-Republicans electors in each state were so reluctant to be seen as the one responsible for causing outgoing President Adams to be elected as vice president that every Democratic-Republican elector cast a vote for both Jefferson and Burr, resulting in a tie.\n\nConsequently, a contingent presidential election was held in the House of Representatives. Federalist-controlled state delegations cast their votes for Burr in an effort to prevent Jefferson from becoming president. Neither Burr nor Jefferson was able to win on the first 35 ballots. With help from [[Alexander Hamilton]], the gridlock was finally broken on the 36th ballot and Jefferson was elected president on February 17, 1801.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815|last=Wood|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|location=New York|pages=285}}</ref> This prolonged contingent election, combined with the increasing Democratic-Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate, led to a consequential change in the nation's frame of government, the requirement of separate votes for president and vice president in the Electoral College.\n\n==Adoption==\n===Journey to Congress===\nIn March 1801, weeks after the election of 1800 was resolved, two amendments were proposed in the New York state legislature that would form the skeleton of the Twelfth Amendment. Governor John Jay submitted an amendment to the state legislature that would require a district election of electors in each state. Assemblyman [[Jedediah Peck]] submitted an amendment to adopt designations for the votes for president and vice president. The two amendments were not considered until early 1802 because the state legislature took a break for the summer and winter. New York state senator DeWitt Clinton moved for the adoption of the amendment in January 1802. Shortly thereafter, Clinton won a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in bringing the designation amendment to Congress. The process continued in New York on February 15 when Representative Benjamin Walker of New York proposed the designation and district election amendments to the House. Debate on the amendments began in May. The Republicans wanted to decide on the amendment quickly, but the Federalists argued that the ideas needed more time than the current session allowed. Federalist Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut wanted to examine the necessity of a vice president. The amendment ultimately failed in the New York State Senate, but DeWitt Clinton brought the amendment discussion to the House of Representatives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT}}</ref>\n\nCongress was ready to debate the presented amendment, but the Democratic-Republicans decided to wait for the [[8th United States Congress|8th Congress]]. The 8th Congress would allow the Democratic-Republicans a better chance of meeting the two-thirds vote requirement for submitting a proposed Constitutional amendment.\n\n===Congressional debate===\nOn its first day, the 8th Congress considered the designation amendment. The first formulation of the amendment had the five highest electoral vote earners on the ballot in the House if no one candidate had a majority of the electoral votes. Republican [[John Clopton]] of Virginia, the largest state in the Union, argued that having five names on the list for a contingency election took the power from the people, so he proposed that there be only two names on the list. On October 20, the House appointed a seventeen-member committee (one Representative from each state) to fine-tune the amendment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=127\u2013128}}</ref>\n\nThe original proposal starting in the New York state legislature would have, along with designation, put forward the idea of the district election of electors that Treasury Secretary Gallatin had supported. Shortly after the committee was formed, Federalist [[Benjamin Huger (congressman)|Benjamin Huger]] attempted to add a provision regarding district elections to the proposed amendment, but the committee ignored him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=128}}</ref>\n\nThe committee then submitted an updated version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the vice president if there were a tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three because it made it far less likely that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist [[Gaylord Griswold]] argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the president. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNext up for the Federalists was [[Seth Hastings]] of Massachusetts, who submitted the argument that the designation amendment rendered the vice presidency useless and advocated for the elimination of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]]. [[John Cotton Smith|John C. Smith]] asked the inflammatory question of whether the proposed amendment was to help Jefferson get reelected. Speaker [[Nathaniel Macon]] called this inappropriate. After [[Matthew Lyon]] of Kentucky denounced any reference to the three-fifths clause as mere provocation, the House easily passed the resolution 88\u201339 on October 28.\n\nBy October 28, the Senate had already been discussing the designation amendment. Republican [[DeWitt Clinton]] expected that the Senate, with a 24\u20139 Republican majority would quickly pass the amendment. Federalist [[Jonathan Dayton]] proposed that the office of the vice president should be eliminated and his colleague, [[Uriah Tracy]], seconded it. On the other side, [[Wilson Cary Nicholas]] was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas' concern, the Senate would not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nMuch as it had in the House, debate centered around the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator [[Pierce Butler]] of South Carolina argued that the issues with the election of 1800 were unlikely to happen again and he would not advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist vice president. [[John Quincy Adams]] argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the president balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of president and vice president would tip that scale in favor of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=136\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nFederalist senators argued for retaining the original procedure for the Electoral College. Senator [[Samuel White (American politician)|Samuel White]] of Delaware claimed that the original procedure had not been given \"a fair experiment\" and criticized the proposed amendment for entrenching the [[two-party system]] that had taken over presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomformula.us/articles/a-far-superior-method/|title=A Far Superior Method\u2014the Original Electoral College|last=Alder|first=Carolyn|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Freedom Formula|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Republicans appealed to democratic principles. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]] of Maryland argued that the presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because it would otherwise be possible to have the fifth best candidate become president. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the House of Representatives, and the president is then much more likely to be the people's choice. Another of Smith's arguments was simply the election of 1800. [[William Cocke]] of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=137}}</ref>\n\nOne last order of business for the amendment was to deal with the possibility that the House would fail to choose a president by March 4. It was the least controversial portion of the Twelfth Amendment and [[John Taylor of Caroline|John Taylor]] proposed that the vice president would take over as president in that peculiar occurrence, \"as in case of the death or other Constitutional disability of the President.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nIt seemed clear all along that the Republican dominance would render this a no-contest and the Republicans were just waiting for all of their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate, lasting from 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., was the order of the day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. Tracy claimed the original procedure was formulated to give the small states a chance to elect the vice president, who would be a check on the president's powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this only works if you make it partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Republican small state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|location=Westport, CT|pages=140\u2013141}}</ref>\n\n===Proposal and ratification===\n[[Image:12th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|upright=.90|thumb|The Twelfth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment was proposed by the [[8th United States Congress|8th Congress]] on December 9, 1803, when it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by vote of 84&ndash;42,<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Annals of Congress 775 (1805)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=013/llac013.db&recNum=385|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> having been previously passed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 22&ndash;10, on December 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Annals of Congress 209 (1805)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=013/llac013.db&recNum=102|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> The amendment was officially submitted to the states on December 12, 1803, and was [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratified]] by the [[State legislature (United States)|legislatures]] of the following states:<ref name=CUSA2017GPO>{{cite web|title=Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation|date=August 26, 2017|url=https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office, Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=28\u201330|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n# [[North Carolina]] (December 22, 1803)\n# [[Maryland]] (December 24, 1803)\n# [[Kentucky]] (December 27, 1803)\n# [[Ohio]] (December 30, 1803)\n# [[Pennsylvania]] (January 5, 1804)\n# [[Vermont]] (January 30, 1804)\n# [[Virginia]] (February 3, 1804)\n# [[New York (state)|New York]] (February 10, 1804)\n# [[New Jersey]] (February 22, 1804)\n# [[Rhode Island]] (March 12, 1804)\n# [[South Carolina]] (May 15, 1804)\n# [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (May 19, 1804)\n# [[New Hampshire]] (June 15, 1804)<br>Having been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (13 of 17), the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment was completed and it became a part of the Constitution.{{efn-ua|Rati\ufb01cation was probably completed on June 15, 1804, when the [[New Hampshire Legislature]] ratified the amendment.

The new electoral process was first used for the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]]. Each presidential election since has been conducted under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment.\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment stipulates that each elector must cast distinct votes for president and vice president, instead of two votes for president. Additionally, electors may not vote for presidential and vice-presidential candidates who both reside in the elector's state\u2014at least one of them must be an inhabitant of another state.\n\nIf no candidate for president has a majority of the total votes, the House of Representatives, voting by states and with the same [[quorum]] requirements as under the original procedure, chooses the president. The Twelfth Amendment requires the House to choose from the three highest receivers of electoral votes, compared to five under the original procedure.\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment requires a person to receive a majority of the electoral votes for vice president for that person to be elected vice president by the Electoral College. If no candidate for vice president has a majority of the total votes, the Senate, with each senator having one vote, chooses the vice president. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose between the candidates with the \"two highest numbers\" of electoral votes. If multiple individuals are tied for second place, the Senate may consider all of them, in addition to the individual with the greatest number of votes. The Twelfth Amendment introduced a quorum requirement of two-thirds of the whole number of senators for the conduct of balloting. Furthermore, the Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose a vice president by way of the affirmative votes of \"a majority of the whole number\" of senators.\n\nTo prevent deadlocks from keeping the nation leaderless, the Twelfth Amendment provided that if the House did not choose a president before March 4 (then the first day of a presidential term), the individual elected vice president would \"act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.\" The Twelfth Amendment did not state for how long the vice president would act as president or if the House could still choose a president after March 4. [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment]], adopted in 1933, supersedes that provision of the Twelfth Amendment by changing the date upon which a new presidential term commences to January 20, clarifying that the vice president-elect would only \"act as President\" if the House has not chosen a president by January 20, and permitting Congress to statutorily provide \"who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected\" if there is no president-elect or vice president-elect by January 20. It also clarifies that if there is no president-elect on January 20, whoever acts as president does so until a person \"qualified\" to occupy the presidency is elected to be president.\n\n===Interaction with the Twenty-second Amendment===\n{{See also|Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution#Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment}}\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment explicitly states the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|constitutional requirements as provided for the president]] also apply to being vice president. It is unclear whether a two-term president could later serve as vice president. Some argue that the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] and Twelfth Amendment both bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the [[United States presidential line of succession]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand|author=Matthew J.

(In South Carolina, whose presidential electors were Whigs, no popular vote was held as the state legislature chose the electors.)\n\nThe basis for the Whigs strategy lay in a severe state-level Democratic Party [[1835 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election|split]] in Pennsylvania that propelled the Whig-aligned [[Anti-Masonic Party]] to [[Political party strength in Pennsylvania|statewide power]]. Party alignments by state in the House of Representatives suggest that any contingent election would have had [[1834 and 1835 United States House of Representatives elections|an uncertain outcome]], with none of the candidates (Van Buren, William Henry Harrison and Hugh White) having a clear path to victory.\n\nIn that same election, no candidate for vice president secured an electoral majority as the Democratic electors from [[Virginia]] refused to vote for Democratic vice presidential nominee, [[Richard Mentor Johnson]], due to his relationship with a former slave, and instead cast their votes for [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]].\n\nAs a result, Johnson received 147 electoral votes, one vote short of a majority, followed by [[Francis Granger]] with 77, [[John Tyler]] with 47 and Smith with 23. Thus, it became necessary for the Senate to hold a contingent election between Johnson and Granger for vice president, which Johnson won on the first ballot with 33 votes to Granger's 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Richard_M_Johnson.htm|title=VP Richard Mentor Johnson|date=30 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 1836, no major U.S. party has nominated multiple regional presidential or vice presidential candidates in an election. However, since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], there have been two serious attempts by [[Southern United States|Southern]]-based parties to run regional candidates in hopes of denying either of the two major candidates an electoral college majority. Both attempts (in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]] and [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]) narrowly failed; in both cases, a shift in the result of two or three close states would have forced these respective elections into the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/teacher/campaign.htm|title=Student Activity: Presidential Campaign of 1948|publisher=Harry S.

A Habitation Clause issue arose during the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] contested by [[George W. Bush]] (running-mate [[Dick Cheney]]) and [[Al Gore]] (running-mate [[Joe Lieberman]]), because it was alleged that Bush and Cheney were both inhabitants of [[Texas]] and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Texas' 32 electoral votes were necessary in order to secure Bush and Cheney a majority in the Electoral College. With the Democrats [[2000 United States Senate elections|picking up four seats in the Senate]] to equal the Republicans at 50 seats each in the chamber, the outcome of a contingent election in the Senate, especially if it had happened after the newly elected senators had been seated, would have been far from certain; in fact such an election in 2000, had it happened, would have determined which party controlled the Senate.\n\nBush's residency was unquestioned, as he was [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor of Texas]] at the time. However, Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at [[Halliburton]]. Cheney had grown up in Wyoming, had represented it in Congress and had continuously maintained a residence in the state during his tenure at Halliburton. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to [[Wyoming]] and put his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], where it was dismissed.<ref>Bravin, Jess.

He belonged to the Republican National Party (ANR) and was president of the Supreme Court. On April 30, 1906 he subscribed the act from the foundation of the League of the Independent Youth. He participated in the rebellion of Laureles in 1909, as adjutant of Colonel Escurra. During the short government of Pedro P. Pe\u00f1a he was appointed civilian and military delegate of the campaign. He was delegate for his party and in 1923 he completed his studies in the ANR, along with O\u2019Leary and Dr. Ram\u00edrez. In 1947 he was member of the committee of civil defense.\n\nOn April 28, 1917 he presented a project in which he required the Executive Power to do a copy of all the records of habeas corpus that were presented and the insubordinations to the dispositions of the Supreme Court in this matter. On June 19, 1930 he presented an initiative that tended to the abolition of the article in the Civil Code that allowed the \u201cpact of resale\u201d because he said it caused harm to the private property of the weakest economical classes. He also asked the modification of several other articles in the Constitution and the introduction of some others. On July 12, 1947 he was appointed as President of the Supreme Court of Justice after the death of Juan Le\u00f3n Mallorqu\u00edn. On May 2, 1949 he promoted the First Judicial Congress; on 1956 he promoted the second one.\n\nIn November 1949 Frutos resigned to the Court, after a representative commission of the Red Party asked him to do it in his own home.

Other matters of importance during his period of time were the \u201cLegal Regimen of Intellectual Property\u201d and the creation of the \u201cNational Culture Institute\u201d. Other decrees worth mentioning are the \u201cnationalization of the electric power and train services\u201d and one by which is given the \u201cNational Order to the Merit\u201d to philosopher and professor, Enrique Molina.\n\n==Words of Juan Manuel Frutos==\n\u201cI will make my best effort to accomplish the pacification of the spirits, the respect of the law and the wellbeing of the Paraguayan family\u201d.\n\nIt was said that Juan Manuel Frutos governed like a \u201ckarai a lo yma\u201d (an old fashion true gentleman), a president like it would never be seen again in the country.\n\n==Political career==\nHe was a very active man in politics since very young, he participated in many riots in his time. He belonged to the Republican National Party (ANR) and was president of the Supreme Court. On April 30, 1906 he subscribed the act from the foundation of the League of the Independent Youth. He participated in the rebellion of Laureles in 1909, as adjutant of Colonel Escurra. During the short government of Pedro P. Pe\u00f1a he was appointed civilian and military delegate of the campaign. He was delegate for his party and in 1923 he completed his studies in the ANR, along with O\u2019Leary and Dr. Ram\u00edrez. In 1947 he was member of the committee of civil defense.\n\nOn April 28, 1917 he presented a project in which he required the Executive Power to do a copy of all the records of habeas corpus that were presented and the insubordinations to the dispositions of the Supreme Court in this matter. On June 19, 1930 he presented an initiative that tended to the abolition of the article in the Civil Code that allowed the \u201cpact of resale\u201d because he said it caused harm to the private property of the weakest economical classes. He also asked the modification of several other articles in the Constitution and the introduction of some others. On July 12, 1947 he was appointed as President of the Supreme Court of Justice after the death of Juan Le\u00f3n Mallorqu\u00edn. On May 2, 1949 he promoted the First Judicial Congress; on 1956 he promoted the second one.\n\nIn November 1949 Frutos resigned to the Court, after a representative commission of the Red Party asked him to do it in his own home. He denied the request, but they still managed to take him out of the position, not without him arranging an affidavit expressing the illegal situation.\n\n==References==\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box|\n before=[[Higinio Mor\u00ed\u00f1igo]]|\n title=[[President of Paraguay]]|\n after=[[Juan Natalicio Gonz\u00e1lez]]|\n years=1948\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Paraguay Presidents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frutos, Juan Manuel}}\n[[Category:1879 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Asunci\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan judges]]\n[[Category:Colorado Party (Paraguay) politicians]]\n[[Category:Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n alumni]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan lawyers]]\n", "name_user": "Fernandokaiserbr", "label": "safe", "comment": "New image of the president added.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Frutos"}

Ordered to find a suitable method of killing, the ''Technical Institute for the Detection of Crime'' (\"Kriminaltechnisches Institut der Sicherheitspolizei\", abbreviated KTI) of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] (RSHA) decided to gas victims with [[Carbon monoxide]].{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405}} In October 1939 the Nazis started gassing prisoners in [[Fort VII]] near [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. The first victims were Polish and Jewish inmates of asylums for the mentally ill.{{sfn|Alberti|2006|p=326-327}} Witnesses report that since December 1939, mobile gas chambers were used to kill the inmates of asylums in [[Pomerania]], [[Eastern Prussia]] and [[Poland]].{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405-406}} The vans were built for the [[Herbert Lange|Sonderkommando Lange]] and their use was supposed to speed up the killings. Instead of transporting the victims to the gas chambers, the gas chambers were transported to the victims. They were most likely devised by specialists from the Referat II D of the RSHA. These mobile gas chambers worked under the same principles as the stationary gas chambers: through a rubber hose the driver released pure CO from steel cylinders into the air tight special construction that was shaped like a box and placed on the carrier. The vans resembled moving vans or delivery lorries and they were labelled ''[[Kaiser\u2019s Kaffee Gesch\u00e4ft]]'' ([[:de:Kaiser\u2019s Tengelmann#Kaiser\u2019s vor 1971|de]]) (\u201cKaiser's Coffee Shop\u201d) for camouflage. They were not called \"gas vans\" at the time, but \u201cSonder-Wagen\u201d, \u201cSpezialwagen\u201d (special vans) and \u201cEntlausungswagen\u201d (delousing vans).{{sfn|Alberti|2006|p=327-328}}{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405-406}} The Lange commando killed patients in numerous hospitals in the [[Wartheland]] in 1940. They drove to the hospitals, collected patients, loaded them into the vans and gassed them while they were driving them away.{{sfn|Friedlander|1997|p=139}} From 21 May to 8 June 1940 the Sonderkommando Lange killed 1558 sick people from [[Soldau concentration camp]] alone.{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=406}}\n\nIn August 1941, SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] attended a demonstration of a mass-shooting of Jews in Minsk that was arranged by [[Arthur Nebe]], after which he vomited. Regaining his composure, Himmler decided that alternative methods of killing should be found.<ref>Longerich, Peter (2012). ''Heinrich Himmler: A Life'', p. 547, {{ISBN|978-0-19-959232-6}}.</ref> He ordered Nebe to explore more \"convenient\" ways of killing that were less stressful for the killers.

Ordered to find a suitable method of killing, the ''Technical Institute for the Detection of Crime'' (\"Kriminaltechnisches Institut der Sicherheitspolizei\", abbreviated KTI) of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] (RSHA) decided to gas victims with [[Carbon monoxide]].{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405}} In October 1939 the Nazis started gassing prisoners in [[Fort VII]] near [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. The first victims were Polish and Jewish inmates of asylums for the mentally ill.{{sfn|Alberti|2006|p=326-327}} Witnesses report that since December 1939, mobile gas chambers were used to kill the inmates of asylums in [[Pomerania]], [[Eastern Prussia]] and [[Poland]].{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405-406}} The vans were built for the [[Herbert Lange|Sonderkommando Lange]] and their use was supposed to speed up the killings. Instead of transporting the victims to the gas chambers, the gas chambers were transported to the victims. They were most likely devised by specialists from the Referat II D of the RSHA. These mobile gas chambers worked under the same principles as the stationary gas chambers: through a rubber hose the driver released pure CO from steel cylinders into the air tight special construction that was shaped like a box and placed on the carrier. The vans resembled moving vans or delivery lorries and they were labelled ''[[Kaiser\u2019s Kaffee Gesch\u00e4ft]]'' ([[:de:Kaiser\u2019s Tengelmann#Kaiser\u2019s vor 1971|de]]) (\u201cKaiser's Coffee Shop\u201d) for camouflage. They were not called \"gas vans\" at the time, but \u201cSonder-Wagen\u201d, \u201cSpezialwagen\u201d (special vans) and \u201cEntlausungswagen\u201d (delousing vans).{{sfn|Alberti|2006|p=327-328}}{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=405-406}} The Lange commando killed patients in numerous hospitals in the [[Wartheland]] in 1940. They drove to the hospitals, collected patients, loaded them into the vans and gassed them while they were driving them away.{{sfn|Friedlander|1997|p=139}} From 21 May to 8 June 1940 the Sonderkommando Lange killed 1558 sick people from [[Soldau concentration camp]] alone.{{sfn|Beer|1987|p=406}}\n\nIn August 1941, SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] attended a demonstration of a mass-shooting of Jews in Minsk that was arranged by [[Arthur Nebe]], after which he vomited. Regaining his composure, Himmler decided that alternative methods of killing should be found.<ref>Longerich, Peter (2012). ''Heinrich Himmler: A Life'', p. 547, {{ISBN|978-0-19-959232-6}}.</ref> He ordered Nebe to explore more \"convenient\" ways of killing that were less stressful for the killers.
