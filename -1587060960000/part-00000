{"title_page": "History of logarithms", "text_new": "[[File:John Napier-Logarithmorum 1620.jpg|thumb|Title page of John Napier's ''Logarithmorum'' from 1620]]\nThe '''history of logarithms''' is the story of a correspondence (in modern terms, a [[group isomorphism]]) between multiplication on the [[positive real numbers]] and addition on the [[real number line]] that was formalized in seventeenth century Europe and was widely used to simplify calculation until the advent of the digital computer.  The [[Napierian logarithm]]s were published first in 1614. [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] introduced [[common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]], which were easier to use. [[mathematical table|Tables]] of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the [[slide rule]], which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the [[natural logarithm]] was the result of a search for an expression of [[area]] against a [[hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]], and required the assimilation of a new [[function (mathematics)|function]] into standard mathematics.\n\n==Common logarithm==\n{{main|Common logarithm}}\n[[Image:Briggs - Canon logarithmorum pro numeris serie naturali crescentibus ab 1. ad 20000., s.d. - 72507.jpg|thumb|''Canon logarithmorum'']]\nAs the common log of ten is one, of a hundred is two, and a thousand is three, the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal-positional number system. The common log is said to have [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10, but base 10,000 is ancient and still common in [[myriad#East Asia|East Asia]]. In his book [[The Sand Reckoner]], [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe. As was noted in 2000:<ref>Ian Bruce (2000) \"Napier\u2019s Logarithms\", [[American Journal of Physics]] 68(2):148</ref>\n:In antiquity Archimedes gave a recipe for reducing multiplication to addition by making use of [[geometric progression]] of numbers and relating them to an [[arithmetic progression]].\nIn 1616 [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier at [[Edinburgh]] in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier's logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon, and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nIn 1624 Briggs published his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).\nThis table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3621843 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The Agony and the Ecstasy: The Development of Logarithms by Henry Briggs | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 86 | issue = 506 | pages = 216\u2013227 | publisher =  | jstor = 3621843 | format =  }}</ref><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|title=The Difference Method of Henry Briggs|accessdate=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329033744/http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|archive-date=2012-03-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nHe also completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent|tangents]] for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\n==Natural logarithm==\n{{main|Natural logarithm}}\n[[Image:Saint-Vincent - Opus geometricum posthumum ad mesolabium per rationum proportionalium novas proprietates, 1668 - 877986.jpg|thumb|''Opus geometricum posthumum'', 1668]]\nIn 1649, [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], a former student of [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]],<ref>In 1647, Gregoire de Saint-Vincent published his book, ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni'' (Geometric work of squaring the circle and conic sections), vol. 2 (Antwerp, (Belgium):  Johannes and Jakob Meursius, 1647).

When, in the 18th century, this geometric basis was discarded in favour of a fully analytical one, no extension or reformulation was necessary \u2013 the concept of \"hyperbola-area\" was transformed painlessly into \"natural logarithm\".\n\n[[Leonard Euler]] treated a logarithm as an [[exponent]] of a certain number called the base of the logarithm. He noted that the number 2.71818, and its reciprocal, provided a point on the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 such that an [[area]] of one square unit lies beneath the hyperbola, right of (1,1) and above the asymptote of the hyperbola. He then called the logarithm, with this number as base, the ''natural logarithm''.\n\nAs noted by [[Howard Eves]], \"One of the anomalies in the history of mathematics is the fact that logarithms were discovered before exponents were in use.\"<ref>H.

However, the quarter-square method could not be used for division without an additional table of reciprocals (or the knowledge of a sufficiently simple [[Multiplicative inverse#Algorithms|algorithm to generate reciprocals]]). Large tables of quarter squares were used to simplify the accurate multiplication of large numbers from 1817 onwards until this was superseded by the use of computers.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Indian mathematician [[Virasena]] worked with the concept of ardhaccheda: the number of times a number of the form 2n could be halved.

We know that B\u00fcrgi had some way of simplifying calculations around 1588, but most likely this way was the use of prosthaphaeresis, and not the use of his table of progressions which probably goes back to about 1600. Indeed Wittich, who was in Kassel from 1584 to 1586, brought with him knowledge of [[prosthaphaeresis]], a method by which [[multiplication]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]]s can be replaced by [[addition]]s and [[subtraction]]s of trigonometrical values...

These mantissas are all positive and enclosed in the interval {{closed-open|0,1}}. The common logarithm of any given positive number is then obtained by adding its mantissa to the common logarithm of the second factor. This logarithm is called the ''characteristic'' of the given number. Since the common logarithm of a power of {{math|10}} is exactly the exponent, the characteristic is an integer number, which makes the common logarithm exceptionally useful in dealing with decimal numbers. For numbers less than {{math|1,}} the characteristic makes the resulting logarithm negative, as required.<ref>E. R.

Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\nIn 1624 his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', appeared in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty-thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000). This table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\"/>\n\nVlacq's table was later found to contain 603 errors, but \"this cannot be regarded as a great number, when it is considered that the table was the result of an original calculation, and that more than 2,100,000 printed figures are liable to error.\"<ref>''Athenaeum,'' 15 June 1872.  See also the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' for May 1872.</ref>  An edition of Vlacq's work, containing many corrections, was issued at [[Leipzig]] in 1794 under the title ''Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus'' by [[Jurij Vega]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Callet]]'s seven-place table ([[Paris]], 1795), instead of stopping at 100,000, gave the eight-place logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 108,000, in order to diminish the errors of [[interpolation]], which were greatest in the early part of the table, and this addition was generally included in seven-place tables. The only important published extension of Vlacq's table was made by Mr. Sang in 1871, whose table contained the seven-place logarithms of all numbers below 200,000.\n\nBriggs and Vlacq also published original tables of the logarithms of the [[trigonometric function]]s. Briggs completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent]]s for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''. Tables logarithms of trigonometric functions simplify hand calculations where a function of an angle must be multiplied by another number, as is often the case.\n\nBesides the tables mentioned above, a great collection, called ''Tables du Cadastre,'' was constructed under the direction of [[Gaspard de Prony]], by an original computation, under the auspices of the [[France|French]] republican government of the 1790s.  This work, which contained the logarithms of all numbers up to 100,000 to nineteen places, and of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 to twenty-four places, exists only in manuscript, \"in seventeen enormous folios,\" at the Observatory of Paris.  It was begun in 1792, and \"the whole of the calculations, which to secure greater accuracy were performed in duplicate, and the two manuscripts subsequently collated with care, were completed in the short space of two years.\"  <ref name=\"Pronybio\">''English Cyclopaedia, Biography,'' Vol. IV., article \"Prony.\"</ref> [[Cubic function|Cubic]] [[interpolation]] could be used to find the logarithm of any number to a similar accuracy.\n\nFor different needs, logarithm tables ranging from small handbooks to multi-volume editions have been compiled:<ref>{{citation|title=Orbital Motion|first=A.

[[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by [[Edmund Wingate]] (c.1593\u20131656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled ''L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie''. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, April 1845, p187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with [[mechanical calculator]] in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that [[engineering]] became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe\u2013but not in the United States.  There Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881.

The [[Napierian logarithm]]s were published first in 1614. [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] introduced [[common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]], which were easier to use. [[mathematical table|Tables]] of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the [[slide rule]], which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the [[natural logarithm]] was the result of a search for an expression of [[area]] against a [[hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]], and required the assimilation of a new [[function (mathematics)|function]] into standard mathematics.\n\n==Common logarithm==\n{{main|Common logarithm}}\n[[Image:Briggs - Canon logarithmorum pro numeris serie naturali crescentibus ab 1. ad 20000., s.d. - 72507.jpg|thumb|''Canon logarithmorum'']]\nAs the common log of ten is one, of a hundred is two, and a thousand is three, the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal-positional number system. The common log is said to have [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10, but base 10,000 is ancient and still common in [[myriad#East Asia|East Asia]]. In his book [[The Sand Reckoner]], [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe. As was noted in 2000:<ref>Ian Bruce (2000) \"Napier\u2019s Logarithms\", [[American Journal of Physics]] 68(2):148</ref>\n:In antiquity Archimedes gave a recipe for reducing multiplication to addition by making use of [[geometric progression]] of numbers and relating them to an [[arithmetic progression]].\nIn 1616 [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier at [[Edinburgh]] in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier's logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon, and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nIn 1624 Briggs published his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).\nThis table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3621843 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The Agony and the Ecstasy: The Development of Logarithms by Henry Briggs | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 86 | issue = 506 | pages = 216\u2013227 | publisher =  | jstor = 3621843 | format =  }}</ref><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|title=The Difference Method of Henry Briggs|accessdate=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329033744/http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|archive-date=2012-03-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nHe also completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent|tangents]] for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\n==Natural logarithm==\n{{main|Natural logarithm}}\n[[Image:Saint-Vincent - Opus geometricum posthumum ad mesolabium per rationum proportionalium novas proprietates, 1668 - 877986.jpg|thumb|''Opus geometricum posthumum'', 1668]]\nIn 1649, [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], a former student of [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]],<ref>In 1647, Gregoire de Saint-Vincent published his book, ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni'' (Geometric work of squaring the circle and conic sections), vol. 2 (Antwerp, (Belgium):  Johannes and Jakob Meursius, 1647).

When, in the 18th century, this geometric basis was discarded in favour of a fully analytical one, no extension or reformulation was necessary \u2013 the concept of \"hyperbola-area\" was transformed painlessly into \"natural logarithm\".\n\n[[Leonard Euler]] treated a logarithm as an [[exponent]] of a certain number called the base of the logarithm. He noted that the number 2.7818, and its reciprocal, provided a point on the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 such that an [[area]] of one square unit lies beneath the hyperbola, right of (1,1) and above the asymptote of the hyperbola. He then called the logarithm, with this number as base, the ''natural logarithm''.\n\nAs noted by [[Howard Eves]], \"One of the anomalies in the history of mathematics is the fact that logarithms were discovered before exponents were in use.\"<ref>H.

This used the trigonometric identity\n:<math>\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta = \\frac12[\\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)]</math>\nor similar to convert the multiplications to additions and table lookups. However, logarithms are more straightforward and require less work. It can be shown using [[Euler's formula]] that the two techniques are related.\n\n===B\u00fcrgi===\nThe Swiss mathematician [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]] constructed a table of progressions which can be considered a table of [[antilogarithm]]s<ref>Jost B\u00fcrgi, ''Arithmetische und Geometrische Progress Tabulen'' \u2026 [Arithmetic and Geometric Progression Tables \u2026 ],  (Prague, (Czech Republic):  University [of Prague] Press, 1620).

We know that B\u00fcrgi had some way of simplifying calculations around 1588, but most likely this way was the use of prosthaphaeresis, and not the use of his table of progressions which probably goes back to about 1600. Indeed Wittich, who was in Kassel from 1584 to 1586, brought with him knowledge of [[prosthaphaeresis]], a method by which [[multiplication]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]]s can be replaced by [[addition]]s and [[subtraction]]s of trigonometrical values...

These mantissas are all positive and enclosed in the interval {{closed-open|0,1}}. The common logarithm of any given positive number is then obtained by adding its mantissa to the common logarithm of the second factor. This logarithm is called the ''characteristic'' of the given number. Since the common logarithm of a power of {{math|10}} is exactly the exponent, the characteristic is an integer number, which makes the common logarithm exceptionally useful in dealing with decimal numbers. For numbers less than {{math|1,}} the characteristic makes the resulting logarithm negative, as required.<ref>E. R.

The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\nIn 1624 his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', appeared in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty-thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000). This table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\"/>\n\nVlacq's table was later found to contain 603 errors, but \"this cannot be regarded as a great number, when it is considered that the table was the result of an original calculation, and that more than 2,100,000 printed figures are liable to error.\"<ref>''Athenaeum,'' 15 June 1872.  See also the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' for May 1872.</ref>  An edition of Vlacq's work, containing many corrections, was issued at [[Leipzig]] in 1794 under the title ''Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus'' by [[Jurij Vega]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Callet]]'s seven-place table ([[Paris]], 1795), instead of stopping at 100,000, gave the eight-place logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 108,000, in order to diminish the errors of [[interpolation]], which were greatest in the early part of the table, and this addition was generally included in seven-place tables. The only important published extension of Vlacq's table was made by Mr. Sang in 1871, whose table contained the seven-place logarithms of all numbers below 200,000.\n\nBriggs and Vlacq also published original tables of the logarithms of the [[trigonometric function]]s. Briggs completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent]]s for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''. Tables logarithms of trigonometric functions simplify hand calculations where a function of an angle must be multiplied by another number, as is often the case.\n\nBesides the tables mentioned above, a great collection, called ''Tables du Cadastre,'' was constructed under the direction of [[Gaspard de Prony]], by an original computation, under the auspices of the [[France|French]] republican government of the 1790s.  This work, which contained the logarithms of all numbers up to 100,000 to nineteen places, and of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 to twenty-four places, exists only in manuscript, \"in seventeen enormous folios,\" at the Observatory of Paris.

[[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by [[Edmund Wingate]] (c.1593\u20131656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled ''L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie''. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, April 1845, p187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with [[mechanical calculator]] in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that [[engineering]] became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe\u2013but not in the United States.

The Browns' first selection as an NFL team was [[Ken Carpenter (American football)|Ken Carpenter]], a [[wide receiver]] from [[Oregon State University|Oregon State]]. The team's most recent first round selections were [[Baker Mayfield]], quarterback at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] and [[Denzel Ward]], cornerback at [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].</onlyinclude>\n\nEvery year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate [[draft (sports)|draft]] known as \"[[NFL draft|the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting]]\", which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [[Super Bowl]]; the Super Bowl champion ''always'' picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser ''always'' picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. \n\nThe Browns did not have any draft choices from [[1996 NFL season|1996]] to [[1998 NFL season|1998]], because then-owner [[Art Modell]] took all the team's players to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], effectively stopping the franchise. However, the NFL mandated that the Browns' name, colors, and franchise history remain in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and that the team would reactivate by 1999. In [[1999 NFL season|1999]], the Browns selected number one overall, drafting [[University of Kentucky]] quarterback [[Tim Couch]].\n\nThe Browns have selected number one overall five times: [[Bobby Garrett]] ([[1954 Cleveland Browns season|1954]]), Tim Couch ([[1999 Cleveland Browns season|1999]]), [[Courtney Brown (defensive end)|Courtney Brown]] ([[2000 Cleveland Browns season|2000]]), [[Myles Garrett]] ([[2017 Cleveland Browns season|2017]]) and Baker Mayfield ([[2018 Cleveland Browns season|2018]]). The team has also selected number two overall only once and number three overall five times. The Browns have selected players from the [[University of Michigan]] five times, [[Ohio State University]] and the [[University of Southern California]] four times, and the [[University of Florida]] three times. Four eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] were selected by the Browns: [[Doug Atkins]], [[Jim Brown]], [[Paul Warfield]], and [[Ozzie Newsome]].\n\n==Player selections==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | <small>Selected number one overall *</small>\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | <small>Enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] \u2020</small>\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Pick\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Player name\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Position\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|College\n! class=unsortable style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Notes</onlyinclude>\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | National Football League, Early Era (1950\u20131969)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1950 NFL Draft|1950]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Ken Carpenter (American football)|Ken Carpenter]]\n| [[Wide receiver|WR]]/[[Running back|RB]]\n| [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1951 NFL Draft|1951]]\n| align=\"center\" | 14\n| [[Ken Konz|Kenny Konz]]\n| [[Defensive back|DB]]\n| [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[1952 NFL Draft|1952]]\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| [[Bert Rechichar]]\n| DB/RB/[[Placekicker|K]]/[[Linebacker|LB]]/[[Punter (football position)|P]]\n| [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Rechichar>The Browns acquired their first pick in 1952 from [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]] for E/T Jim Martin.</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| [[Harry Agganis]]\n| [[Quarterback|QB]]\n| [[Boston University Terriers football|Boston]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Agganis>Harry Agganis did not take a snap for the Browns in the NFL, opting instead to play [[Major League Baseball|professional baseball]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] as the team's starting [[first baseman]].</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1953 NFL Draft|1953]]\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | [[Doug Atkins]] \u2020\n| [[Lineman (football)|DL]]/[[End (American football)|E]]\n| [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[1954 NFL Draft|1954]]\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | 1\n| style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | [[Bobby Garrett]] *\n| QB\n| [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Garrett>The Browns first pick in 1954 was a bonus lottery choice.</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| [[John Bauer (American football)|John Bauer]]\n| OL\n| [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1955 NFL Draft|1955]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Kurt Burris]]\n| [[Cornerback|CB]]/LB\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1956 NFL Draft|1956]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Preston Carpenter]]\n| E/RB/[[Tight end|TE]]\n| [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1957 NFL Draft|1957]]\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | [[Jim Brown]] \u2020\n| [[Fullback (American football)|FB]]\n| [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1958 NFL Draft|1958]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Jim Shofner]]\n| DB\n| [[Texas Christian Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1959 NFL Draft|1959]]\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| [[Rich Kreitling]]\n| WR/E\n| [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1960 NFL Draft|1960]]\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| [[Jim Houston]]\n| DL/LB\n| [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1961 NFL Draft|1961]]\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| [[Bobby Crespino]]\n| WR/E/TE\n| [[Mississippi Rebels football|Mississippi]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Crespino>The Browns traded their first pick in 1961 to [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] for T [[Paul Dickson (American football)|Paul Dickson]] and the Cowboys' first pick in 1962.

the Browns' first-round draft pick in 1957]]\n<onlyinclude>The [[Cleveland Browns]] joined the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in [[1950 NFL season|1950]] with the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] after having spent four seasons with the [[All-America Football Conference]]. The Browns' first selection as an NFL team was [[Ken Carpenter (American football)|Ken Carpenter]], a [[wide receiver]] from [[Oregon State University|Oregon State]]. The team's most recent first round selections were [[Baker Mayfield]], quarterback at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] and [[Denzel Ward]], cornerback at [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].</onlyinclude>\n\nEvery year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate [[draft (sports)|draft]] known as \"[[NFL draft|the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting]]\", which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [[Super Bowl]]; the Super Bowl champion ''always'' picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser ''always'' picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. \n\nThe Browns did not have any draft choices from [[1996 NFL season|1996]] to [[1998 NFL season|1998]], because then-owner [[Art Modell]] took all the team's players to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], effectively stopping the franchise. However, the NFL mandated that the Browns' name, colors, and franchise history remain in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and that the team would reactivate by 1999. In [[1999 NFL season|1999]], the Browns selected number one overall, drafting [[University of Kentucky]] quarterback [[Tim Couch]].\n\nThe Browns have selected number one overall five times: [[Bobby Garrett]] ([[1954 Cleveland Browns season|1954]]), Tim Couch ([[1999 Cleveland Browns season|1999]]), [[Courtney Brown (football player)|Courtney Brown]] ([[2000 Cleveland Browns season|2000]]), [[Myles Garrett]] ([[2017 Cleveland Browns season|2017]]) and Baker Mayfield ([[2018 Cleveland Browns season|2018]]). The team has also selected number two overall only once and number three overall five times. The Browns have selected players from the [[University of Michigan]] five times, [[Ohio State University]] and the [[University of Southern California]] four times, and the [[University of Florida]] three times. Four eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] were selected by the Browns: [[Doug Atkins]], [[Jim Brown]], [[Paul Warfield]], and [[Ozzie Newsome]].\n\n==Player selections==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | <small>Selected number one overall *</small>\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | <small>Enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] \u2020</small>\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Pick\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Player name\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Position\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|College\n! class=unsortable style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Cleveland Browns|border=2}};\"|Notes</onlyinclude>\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | National Football League, Early Era (1950\u20131969)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1950 NFL Draft|1950]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Ken Carpenter (American football)|Ken Carpenter]]\n| [[Wide receiver|WR]]/[[Running back|RB]]\n| [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1951 NFL Draft|1951]]\n| align=\"center\" | 14\n| [[Ken Konz|Kenny Konz]]\n| [[Defensive back|DB]]\n| [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[1952 NFL Draft|1952]]\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| [[Bert Rechichar]]\n| DB/RB/[[Placekicker|K]]/[[Linebacker|LB]]/[[Punter (football position)|P]]\n| [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Rechichar>The Browns acquired their first pick in 1952 from [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]] for E/T Jim Martin.</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| [[Harry Agganis]]\n| [[Quarterback|QB]]\n| [[Boston University Terriers football|Boston]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Agganis>Harry Agganis did not take a snap for the Browns in the NFL, opting instead to play [[Major League Baseball|professional baseball]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] as the team's starting [[first baseman]].</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1953 NFL Draft|1953]]\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | [[Doug Atkins]] \u2020\n| [[Lineman (football)|DL]]/[[End (American football)|E]]\n| [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[1954 NFL Draft|1954]]\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | 1\n| style=\"background-color: #DDFFDD;\" | [[Bobby Garrett]] *\n| QB\n| [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Garrett>The Browns first pick in 1954 was a bonus lottery choice.</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| [[John Bauer (American football)|John Bauer]]\n| OL\n| [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1955 NFL Draft|1955]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Kurt Burris]]\n| [[Cornerback|CB]]/LB\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1956 NFL Draft|1956]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Preston Carpenter]]\n| E/RB/[[Tight end|TE]]\n| [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1957 NFL Draft|1957]]\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\" | [[Jim Brown]] \u2020\n| [[Fullback (American football)|FB]]\n| [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1958 NFL Draft|1958]]\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| [[Jim Shofner]]\n| DB\n| [[Texas Christian Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1959 NFL Draft|1959]]\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| [[Rich Kreitling]]\n| WR/E\n| [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1960 NFL Draft|1960]]\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| [[Jim Houston]]\n| DL/LB\n| [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]\n| \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[1961 NFL Draft|1961]]\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| [[Bobby Crespino]]\n| WR/E/TE\n| [[Mississippi Rebels football|Mississippi]]\n| align=\"center\" | <ref name=Crespino>The Browns traded their first pick in 1961 to [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] for T [[Paul Dickson (American football)|Paul Dickson]] and the Cowboys' first pick in 1962.

Once internalized, the fusion protein nicks the target DNA sequence, exposing a 3\u2019-hydroxyl group that can be used to initiate (prime) the [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]] of the RT template portion of the pegRNA. This results in a branched intermediate that contains two DNA flaps: a 3\u2019 flap that contains the newly synthesized (edited) sequence, and a 5\u2019 flap that contains the dispensable, unedited DNA sequence. The 5\u2019 flap is then cleaved by structure-specific [[Endonuclease|endonucleases]] or 5\u2019 [[Exonuclease|exonucleases]]. This process allows 3\u2019 flap ligation, and creates a heteroduplex DNA composed of one edited strand and one unedited strand. The reannealed double stranded DNA contains nucleotide mismatches at the location where editing took place. In order to correct the mismatches, the cells exploit the intrinsic [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]] mechanism, with two possible outcomes: (i) the information in the edited strand is copied into the complementary strand, permanently installing the edit; (ii) the original nucleotides are re-incorporated into the edited strand, excluding the edit.<ref name=\":0\" /><br />\n\n== Development process ==\nDuring the development of this technology, several modifications were done to the components, in order to increase its effectiveness.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Prime editor 1 ===\nIn the first system, a wild-type Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase was fused to the Cas9 H840A nickase C-terminus. Detectable editing efficiencies were observed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Prime editor 2 ===\nIn order to enhance DNA-RNA affinity, enzyme processivity, and thermostability, five amino acid substitutions were incorporated into the M-MLV reverse transcriptase. The mutant M-MLV RT was then incorporated into PE1 to give rise to (Cas9 (H840A)-M-MLV RT(D200N/L603W/T330P/T306K/W313F)). Efficiency improvement was observed over PE1.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:PE3_system_for_prime_editing.png|thumb|PE3 system for prime editing]]\n\n=== Prime editor 3 ===\nDespite its increased efficacy, the edit inserted by PE2 might still be removed due to DNA mismatch repair of the edited strand. To avoid this problem during DNA heteroduplex resolution, an additional single guide RNA (sgRNA) is introduced. This sgRNA is designed to match the edited sequence introduced by the pegRNA, but not the original allele. It directs the Cas9 nickase portion of the fusion protein to nick the unedited strand at a nearby site, opposite to the original nick. Nicking the non-edited strand causes the cell\u2019s natural repair system to copy the information in the edited strand to the complementary strand, permanently installing the edit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n== Implications ==\nAlthough additional research is required to improve the efficiency of prime editing, the technology offers promising scientific improvements over other gene editing tools. The prime editing technology has the potential to correct the vast majority of pathogenic alleles that cause genetic diseases, as it can repair insertions, deletions, and nucleotide substitutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Advantages ===\nThe prime editing tool offers advantages over traditional gene editing technologies. [[CRISPR/Cas9]] edits rely on [[Non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)]] or [[Homology directed repair|homology-directed repair (HDR)]] to fix DNA breaks, while the prime editing system employs [[DNA mismatch repair]]. This is an important feature of this technology given that DNA repair mechanisms such as NHEJ and HDR, generate unwanted, random [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] or [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] (INDELs) byproducts which complicate the retrieval of cells carrying the correct edit.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Cormac|date=2019-11-07|title=Gene editing enters 'prime' time|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-019-00032-5|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|doi=10.1038/d41587-019-00032-5}}</ref>\n\nThe prime system introduces single-stranded DNA breaks instead of the double-stranded DNA breaks observed in other editing tools, such as base editors. Collectively, base editing and prime editing offer complementary strengths and weaknesses for making targeted transition mutations. Base editors offer higher editing efficiency and fewer INDEL byproducts if the desired edit is a transition point mutation and a [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM sequence]] exists roughly 15 bases from the target site. However, because the prime editing technology does require a precisely positioned PAM sequence to target a nucleotide sequence, it offers more flexibility and editing precision. Remarkably, prime editors allow all types of substitutions, [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[Transversion|transversions]] to be inserted into the target sequence.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nBecause the prime system involves three separate DNA binding events (between (i) the guide sequence and the target DNA, (ii) the primer binding site and the target DNA, and (iii) the 3\u2019 end of the nicked DNA strand and the pegRNA), it has been suggested to have fewer undesirable off-target effects than [[CRISPR/Cas9|CRISPR/Cas9.]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThere is considerable interest in applying gene editing methods to the treatment of diseases with a genetic component. However, there are multiple challenges associated with this approach. An effective treatment would require editing of a large number of target cells, which in turn would require an effective method of delivery and a great level of tissue specificity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nAs of 2019, prime editing looks promising for relatively small genetic alterations, but more research needs to be conducted to evaluate whether the technology is efficient in making larger alterations, such as targeted insertions and deletions. Larger genetic alterations would require a longer RT template, which could hinder the efficient delivery of pegRNA to target cells. Furthermore, a pegRNA containing a long RT template could become vulnerable to damage caused by cellular enzymes.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nOverall, much research will be needed before prime editing could be used to correct pathogenic alleles in human diseases.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2019/11/06/questions-david-liu-crispr-prime-editing-answers/|title=Scientist David Liu takes your questions on CRISPR and prime editing|date=2019-11-06|website=STAT|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Delivery method ===\nBase editors used for prime editing is a lab evolved protein, it does not exist in the nature. Which makes it very challenging when delivering it into human body. One of the successful way of inject base editor into animal and plants are assimilate the base editor with a natural virus. Which delivers the base editor by infecting the host. It has shown positive results in plants and animal, but remains questionable in human. Moreover, there are many other ways of delivering methods are being tested that is inspired by CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Other non viral methods are nano-particles, hydrodynamic injection, electroporation, etc. Nevertheless, the are many obstacles on how to deliver the base editors into human body safely and ethically.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Genetics]]\n* [[Glossary of genetics]]\n* [[Human Nature (2019 film)|''Human Nature'' (2019 CRISPR film documentary)]]\n* [[Synthetic biology]]\n* [[Unnatural Selection (TV series)|''Unnatural Selection'' (2019 TV documentary)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}Images created with Biorender. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biorender.com|title=Biorender|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[Category:Biological engineering]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n[[Category:Genetic engineering]]\n[[Category:Genome editing]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Prime editing''' is a \u2018search-and-replace\u2019 [[genome editing]] technology in [[molecular biology]] by which the genome of living organisms may be modified.
