In his book ''Geographia'' (circa 150 AD), [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] called the island  ''Iouernia'' (written {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}; ''ou'' represented /w/).

The distinction between the two is one of the difference between [[Grammatical case|cases]] of [[nouns]] in Irish. ''\u00c9ire'' is the [[nominative case]], the case that is used for nouns that are the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence, i.e., the noun that is ''doing'' something as well as the direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a sentence. ''Erin'' derives from ''\u00c9irinn'', the Irish [[dative case]] of ''\u00c9ire'', which has replaced the nominative case in [[Gaeltacht na nD\u00e9ise|D\u00e9ise]] Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (where the usual word for Ireland is {{lang|gd|\u00c8irinn}}) and [[Manx language|Manx]] (like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, a Goidelic Celtic language), where the word is spelled \"Nerin,\" with the initial ''n-'' probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition ''in''/''an'' \"in\" (cf. Irish ''in \u00c9irinn'', Scottish ''an \u00c8irinn''/''ann an \u00c8irinn'' \"in Ireland\"). The [[genitive case]], ''\u00c9ireann'' (e.g. ''stair na h\u00c9ireann'' \"the history of Ireland, Ireland's history\"), is found in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. ''[[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Irish Rail''), ''[[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Irish Parliament''), ''[[Republic of Ireland|Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann]]'' (''The Republic of Ireland'') or ''[[Northern Ireland|Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Northern Ireland''),\n\n==As a state name ==\n{{multiple image\n| image1=Ireland48cstamp.jpg\n| alt1=''\u00c9ire'' as seen on the country name on current Irish postage stamps.\n| image2=Eurocoin.ie.100.gif\n| width1={{#expr: (150 * 148 / 165) round 0}}\n| alt2=Obverse side of the Irish \u20ac1 coin.\n| width2={{#expr: (150 * 150 / 153) round 0}}\n| footer=Ireland uses ''\u00c9ire'' as the country name on both its [[postage stamp]]s and coinage.\n}}\n{{Main article|Names of the Irish state}}\nArticle 4 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] adopted in 1937 by the government under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] states that ''\u00c9ire'' is the name of the state, or in the English language, ''Ireland''.<ref>\"[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm Constitution of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430174659/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm |date=30 April 2008 }}\".

''Erin'' derives from ''\u00c9irinn'', the Irish [[dative case]] of ''\u00c9ire'', which has replaced the nominative case in [[Gaeltacht na nD\u00e9ise|D\u00e9ise]] Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (where the usual word for Ireland is {{lang|gd|\u00c8irinn}}) and [[Manx language|Manx]] (like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, a Goidelic Celtic language), where the word is spelled \"Nerin,\" with the initial ''n-'' probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition ''in''/''an'' \"in\" (cf. Irish ''in \u00c9irinn'', Scottish ''an \u00c8irinn''/''ann an \u00c8irinn'' \"in Ireland\"). The [[genitive case]], ''\u00c9ireann'' (e.g. ''stair na h\u00c9ireann'' \"the history of Ireland, Ireland's history\"), is found in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. ''[[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Irish Rail''), ''[[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Irish Parliament''), ''[[Republic of Ireland|Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann]]'' (''The Republic of Ireland'') or ''[[Northern Ireland|Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann]]'' (''Northern Ireland''),\n\n==As a state name ==\n{{multiple image\n| image1=Ireland48cstamp.jpg\n| alt1=''\u00c9ire'' as seen on the country name on current Irish postage stamps.\n| image2=Eurocoin.ie.100.gif\n| width1={{#expr: (150 * 148 / 165) round 0}}\n| alt2=Obverse side of the Irish \u20ac1 coin.\n| width2={{#expr: (150 * 150 / 153) round 0}}\n| footer=Ireland uses ''\u00c9ire'' as the country name on both its [[postage stamp]]s and coinage.\n}}\n{{Main article|Names of the Irish state}}\nArticle 4 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] adopted in 1937 by the government under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] states that ''\u00c9ire'' is the name of the state, or in the English language, ''Ireland''.<ref>\"[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm Constitution of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430174659/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm |date=30 April 2008 }}\".

First published in 1995, it was reprinted in 1997. It tells the story of a loving African-American family living in the town of [[Flint, Michigan]], in 1963. When the oldest son (Byron) begins to get into a bit of trouble, the parents decide he should spend the summer and possibly the next school year with Grandma Sands in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The entire family travels there together by car, and during their visit, tragic events take place.\n\nThe book was adapted for [[Hallmark Channel]] in 2013.\n\n==Background and setting==\nThe book takes place from approximately January to October 1963, a turbulent time during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The Watson family is fictional, but the characters are based on members of the author's family, including himself, and many of the events in the first half of the book are based on a farm from the author's childhood and additional personal events. \n\nEvents later in the story center around the historic 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in Birmingham, soon after the [[Birmingham campaign|civil rights protests]] had gained negotiation with white city leaders for integration. KKK members bombed the church on September 15, 1963, killing four girls and injuring many more. In the novel, the incident is depicted as occurring a bit earlier than the historical date, allowing the Watson family to still be on [[summer vacation]] in Birmingham when it took place.\n\nThe bombing was a catalyst for increased activity in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and work on voter registration in Mississippi, during [[Freedom Summer]] of 1964.\n\n==Plot==\nThe novel is a [[First-person narrative|first-person account]] narrated by Kenneth Watson, who lives in [[Flint, Michigan]] with his parents, Daniel and Wilona Watson, his older brother Byron, and younger sister Joetta. The opening chapters establish Kenny as a very bright and shy 4th grader who has difficulty making true friends until Rufus Fry arrives in town from Arkansas. Rufus is also bullied by the students at Clark Elementary for his \"country\" clothes and accent, making Kenny reluctant to befriend him at first, but they are soon inseparable. Kenny is alternatively bullied and protected by his 13 year old brother Byron, whom he calls \"an official teenage juvenile delinquent\". Byron has been retained twice because he often skips school and is still in 6th grade. He invents a series of \"fantastic adventures\" which constantly get him into trouble and include playing with matches in the house and setting things on fire, abusing his parent's credit at the corner grocery store to buy himself treats, and getting a \"[[conk]]\" hairstyle against his parents' orders.\n\nDaniel and Wilona eventually become so frustrated with their inability to \"straighten out\" Byron that they decide to send him to [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to live with Grandma Gloria Sands (Wilona's mother) for at least the summer and possibly an entire year. As soon as the school year concludes, the Watsons ready their car (\"the Brown Bomber\") and embark on a road trip from Flint to Birmingham to deliver Byron to his grandma. Kenny had been looking forward to the \"[[battle royal]]\" between his grandma and Byron, but is disappointed when just a few sharp words from the \"old, old lady\" have Byron speaking respectfully and generally behaving himself, causing Kenny to seek out his own \"adventures\". Grandma Sands warns the children to avoid a particular local [[swimming hole]] because of a dangerous whirlpool, which Kenny misheard as \"Wool Pooh\" due to her thick Alabama accent. Kenny wants to swim there anyway, and is frustrated when Byron and Joetta refuse to go along. Ignoring the warnings of both Grandma Sands and Byron, Kenny jumps into the seemingly tranquil pool and edges deeper and deeper water until the whirlpool catches him and almost pulls him down, but Byron saves him. Remembering his grandmother's words, he imagines that a strange monster he thinks is the mysterious Wool Pooh swam up from below to grab his ankle and pull him under. Byron later insists that there was nothing else in the water, but Kenny is convinced that the Wool Pooh actually exists.\n\nShortly afterwards, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb goes off at a nearby church]] where Joetta is attending [[Sunday school]]. Kenny wanders into the still-smoking church in the immediate aftermath looking for his sister, but instead sees the Wool Pooh in the smoke clinging to a torn girl's shoe that looks like Joetta's. In shock, he walks back to Grandma Sands' house without anyone noticing that he had been at the church, and he's again shocked and confused to find Joetta already there. She claims that it was Kenny who h Gay ad called her away from the church and led her home, and she does not even know that a bombing had taken place right after she'd left Sunday school.\n\nAs soon as they realize that Joetta is safe, the Watsons decide to immediately return home to Flint, trying to avoid explaining the full implications of what has happened to the children. Kenny is unable to process the events in Birmingham and avoids his family and friends over the ensuing weeks, instead spending many hours hiding behind the sofa. Byron eventually coaxes him out and gets Kenny to talk about what happened, which finally brings a flood of tears from Kenny. Encouraging his little brother to \"keep on stepping\", Byron explains that although the world is not perfect, he has to keep moving on.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Kenneth Bernard \"Kenny\" Watson''' - The main character and narrator of the story, the younger of the two sons of the Watsons.

Fur colouring, in particular the facial mask, bears some similarity to [[raccoon]]s and a number of [[civet]]s. Behavior also: Raccoon dogs are nocturnal, yet adjust their daily schedule and habits in response to local availability of food, similar to [[viverrids]], [[ferret]]s, [[weasel]]s, raccoons, and [[red panda]]s, to which raccoon dogs are not closely related.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeveloff |first=S.I. |year=2002 |title=Raccoons: a natural history |chapter=10 |publisher=UBC Press}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nRaccoon dogs are [[omnivore]]s that feed on [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[mollusks]], [[carrion]], and [[insectivore]]s, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries.<ref>Sutor, A., Kauhala, K., & Ansorge, H.

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]].

Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve.

In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998.

Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max.

The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

The tail, at {{convert|12|to|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, is short, amounting to less than a third of the animal's total length and hangs below the [[tarsal joint]]s without touching the ground. The ears are short and protrude only slightly from the fur.\n\nWeights fluctuate according to season: in March they weigh 3&nbsp;kg (6.6&nbsp;lb), while in August to early September males average 6.5\u20137&nbsp;kg (14\u201315&nbsp;lb), with some individuals attaining a maximal weight of {{convert|9|-|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"soviet\">{{cite book |title=Mammals of the Soviet Union |volume=II |at=Part&nbsp;1a |chapter=Sirenia and Carnivora (Sea cows; Wolves, and Bears) |editor1=Heptner, V.G. |editor2=Naumov, N.P. |publisher=Science Publishers, Inc. |place=USA |year=1998 |isbn=1-886106-81-9}}</ref> Specimens from Japanese and Russian studies have been shown to be on average larger than those from Chinese studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-358-01-0001.pdf |title=Mammalian Species: ''Nyctereutes procyonoides'' |author1=Ward, Oscar C. |author2=Wurstert-Hill, Doris H. |publisher=Smith.edu |accessdate=2015-04-09 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122113/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-358-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe winter fur is long and thick with dense [[underfur]] and coarse guard hairs measuring 120&nbsp;mm in length.

Fur colouring, in particular the facial mask, bears some similarity to [[raccoon]]s and a number of [[civet]]s. Behavior also: Raccoon dogs are nocturnal, yet adjust their daily schedule and habits in response to local availability of food, similar to [[viverrids]], [[ferret]]s, [[weasel]]s, raccoons, and [[red panda]]s, to which raccoon dogs are not closely related.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeveloff |first=S.I. |year=2002 |title=Raccoons: a natural history |chapter=10 |publisher=UBC Press}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nRaccoon dogs are [[omnivore]]s that feed on [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[mollusks]], [[carrion]], and [[insectivore]]s, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries.<ref>Sutor, A., Kauhala, K., & Ansorge, H.

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]].

In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur. In the United States, it is marketed as \"Asiatic raccoon\", and in Northern Europe as \"Finn raccoon\".<ref name=furtypes>{{cite web|url=http://www.furcommission.com/farming/mink-biology/furtypes/|title=Fur Types in Brief|work=Furcommission.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max. (1953). ''Fur: a practical treatise'', 3rd ed. New York: Prentice-Hall.</ref> When raised in captivity, raccoon dogs can produce 100&nbsp;g of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of [[goat]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn the Japanese islands, the natives employed raccoon dog skin to make bellows, to decorate their drums, and for winter headgear.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Russian trade in raccoon dogs was quite developed in the Primorye and Ussuri areas in the 1880s. The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

In the late 17th century, the College commissioned a new chapel, one of three buildings in Cambridge to be designed by [[Christopher Wren]] (1677). After Wren's construction, the puritan chapel became the College library until it outgrew the space and a purpose-built library was constructed in 1930.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThere is a large fish pond in the grounds, part of the legacy of the friary. The pond is home of a colony of [[Mallard|ducks]].\n\nThe Fellows' Garden contains a swimming pool, which was originally the friars' bathing pool, making it one of the oldest bathing pools in Europe and allegedly the oldest outdoor pool in continuous use in the UK.

Mildmay's foundation made use of the existing buildings.\n\nMildmay, a [[Puritan]], intended Emmanuel to be a college of training for [[Protestant]] preachers.\n\nLike all of the older Cambridge Colleges, Emmanuel originally took only male students. It first admitted female students in 1979.<ref name=collegehistory>{{cite web| url=https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/history/college/|title=History of the College|website=Emmanuel College|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn every year from 1998 until 2016 Emmanuel was among the top five colleges in the [[Tompkins Table]], which ranks colleges according to end-of-year examination results. Emmanuel topped the table five times (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2010) and placed second six times (2001, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012). Its mean score for 1997\u20132018 inclusive places it as the second highest ranking college after Trinity.\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n\nUnder Mildmay's instruction, the chapel of the original Dominican Friary had been converted to be the College's dining hall, with the friars' dining hall becoming a puritan chapel. In the late 17th century, the College commissioned a new chapel, one of three buildings in Cambridge to be designed by [[Christopher Wren]] (1677). After Wren's construction, the puritan chapel became the College library until it outgrew the space and a purpose-built library was constructed in 1930.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThere is a large fish pond in the grounds, part of the legacy of the friary. The pond is home of a colony of [[Mallard|ducks]].\n\nThe Fellows' Garden contains a swimming pool, which was originally the friars' bathing pool, making it one of the oldest bathing pools in Europe and allegedly the oldest outdoor pool in continuous use in the UK.  It includes an [[Platanus orientalis|Oriental plane]] tree, also in the Fellows' Garden, which is reputed to have lived far longer than is typical of the species.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ron Gray|url=http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/discover/plane/ |title=The Great Oriental Plane Tree at Emmanuel College|publisher=Emmanuel College, Cambridge}}</ref>\n\nThe college also owns the only privately owned [[Rapid transit|subway]] in the UK, connecting the main site to North Court.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Emmanuel College sports grounds - geograph.org.uk - 803309.jpg|College sports grounds\nFile:Emmanuel College Chapel 1, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|The chapel looking towards the altar\nFile:Emmanuel College Front, corridor, panoramica, Cambridge, UK, 2015.jpg|Front Court cloisters\nFile:Emmanuel College Cambridge front.jpg|Front fa\u00e7ade from Downing Street\n</gallery>\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:New Court, Emmanuel College - geograph.org.uk - 634071.jpg|thumb|New Court which was built in 1824\u201325]]\n\nThe Emmanuel College Students' Union (ECSU) is the society of all undergraduate students at Emmanuel College.

The Room itself is a comfortable and well equipped space in the Queen's Building. The MCR committee organises regular social events for graduate students, including well-attended formal dinners in hall every few weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmamcr.org.uk/|title=Emma MCR|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sports and societies===\nA large number of student societies and sports clubs exist at Emmanuel College.

Of the first 100 university graduates in [[New England]], one-third were graduates of Emmanuel College. [[Harvard University]], the first college in the United States, was organised on the model of Emmanuel, as it was then run. Harvard is named for [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] (B.A., 1632), an Emmanuel graduate. Emmanuel and Harvard maintain relations via student exchanges such as the [[Herchel Smith scholarship]]s, the [[Harvard Scholarship]], and the annual Gomes lecture and dinner held each February at Emmanuel in honour of the late [[Peter J. Gomes|Peter Gomes]], erstwhile minister at Harvard's [[Memorial Church of Harvard University|Memorial Church]].\n\nEarly Emmanuel men included several translators of the [[Authorized King James Version|1611 Authorised Version]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nFictional characters who have been said to have gone to Emmanuel include [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[Lemuel Gulliver]]. It is implied that [[Sebastian Faulks]]' eponymous [[Engleby]] and Thomas Richardson also matriculated at Emmanuel. The protagonist in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s masterpiece [[The Way of All Flesh]] also went to Emmanuel.

Headquartered at [[Baylor University]], directed by ICPC Executive Director and Baylor Professor Dr. William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates autonomous regional contests covering six continents culminating in a global World Finals every year.  In 2018, ICPC participation included 52,709 students from 3,233 universities in 110 countries.<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/pdf/Factsheet.pdf</ref>\n\nThe ICPC operates under the auspices of the [[ICPC Foundation]] and operates under agreements with host universities and non-profits, all in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures.<ref name=\"icpcpp\">https://icpc.baylor.edu/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf</ref> Since 1977 until 2017 ICPC was held under the auspices of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and was referred to as ACM-ICPC.<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/download/community/history/Factsheet-2017.pdf</ref>\n\nTracing its roots to 1970, over 320,000 ICPC alumni populate the professional ranks of high-tech companies, consulting firms, financial institutions, investment firms, high-tech startups, venture-capital firms, academia, and public service.<ref>https://www.quora.com/What-is-more-important-to-companies-like-Google-competitive-programming-skills-or-work-experience-in-programming/answer/Bill-Poucher</ref> ICPC Alumni are developers, software engineers, senior software engineers, leads, chiefs, CTOs, CEOs, founders, and co-founders. They are also professors, researchers, and in public service. A good number are in venture capital, helping others start companies. One is a comedian.<ref>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-confirmed-that-anyone-who-is-a-winner-of-the-ACM-ICPC-can-get-a-job-in-Google-Facebook-and-Microsoft-with-a-good-salary/answer/Bill-Poucher</ref>\n\n==Mission==\nThe ICPC, the \u201cInternational Collegiate Programming Contest\u201d, is an extra-curricular, competitive programming sport for students at universities around the world. ICPC competitions provide gifted students opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their teamwork, programming, and problem-solving process. The ICPC is a global platform for academia, industry, and community to shine the spotlight on and raise the aspirations of the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.<ref name=\"acmicpc1\">{{Cite web |url=https://acmicpc.org/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328102509/https://acmicpc.org/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf |archive-date=2018-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at [[Texas A&M University]] in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). This initial programming competition was titled First Annual Texas Collegiate Programming Championship and each University was represented by a team of up to five members. The computer used was a [[IBM System 360|360 model 65]] which was one of the first machines with a DAT (Dynamic Address Translator aka \"paging\") system for accessing memory. The start of the competition was delayed for about 90 minutes because two of the four \"memory bank\" amplifiers were down. Teams that participated included, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, University of Houston, and five or six other Texas University / Colleges. There were three problems that had to be completed and the cumulative time from \"start\" to \"successful completion\" determined first-, second-, and third-place winners. The programming language used was [[Fortran]]. The programs were written on coding sheets, keypunched on [[Hollerith card]]s, and submitted for execution.  The [[University of Houston]] team won the competition completing all three problems successfully with time. The second- and third-place teams did not successfully complete all three three problems. The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams of four from universities throughout the United States and Canada. Headquartered at [[Baylor University]] since 1989, with regional contests established within the world's university community, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition. To increase access to the World Finals, teams were reduced to three students within their first five academic years.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2017 [[IBM]] was the sponsor of ICPC. During that time contest participation has grown by more than 2000%. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2017, 46,381 students from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents participated in regional competitions. Organized as a highly localized extra-curricular university mind sport and operating as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits, the ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world.\n\nUPE has provided continuous support since 1970 and honored World Finalists since the first Finals in 1976. The ICPC is indebted to ACM member contributions and ACM assistance from 1976-2018. Baylor University has served since 1985, hosting ICPC Headquarters since 1989. The ICPC operates as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits to insure that participation in ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world. See ICPC Policies and Procedures.<ref name=\"icpcpp\"/>\n\nThe ICPC World Finals (The Annual World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest) is the final round of competition. Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide with 140 teams competing in the 2018 World Finals. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state. In recent years, media impressions have hovered at the one billion mark.\n\nSince 2000, only teams from [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Poland]] have won the ICPC world finals. Participation in [[North America]] is much smaller than in the rest of the world, which is partially attributed to the perceived low payoff of participating.<ref name=\"sigcse16\">{{cite journal |url=https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja/pubs/sigcse2016-programming-contests.pdf |title=A Programming Contest Strategy Guide |first1=Aaron |last1=Bloomfield |first2=Borja |last2=Sotomayor |journal=SIGCSE '16: Proceedings of the 47th ACM Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education }}</ref>\n\n==Contest rules==\nICPC contests are team competitions. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm|title=Information - ICPC|accessdate=2008-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080616223212/http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm| archivedate= 16 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Regionals/EligibilityDecisionTree.pdf|title=2008 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Decision Diagram|accessdate=2008-06-10|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nDuring each contest, the teams of three are given 5 hours to solve between eight and fifteen programming problems (with eight typical for regionals and twelve for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]],<ref>http://acmgnyr.org/year2019/rules.shtml</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44899|title=Python at ICPC world finals 2017 - Codeforces|website=Codeforces|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/rules_winter15.php|title=ACM ICPC meets FAU|last=team|first=ICPC|website=icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de|access-date=2016-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914122237/https://icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/rules_winter15.php|archive-date=2016-09-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> or [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]]<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment</ref> (although it is not guaranteed every problem is solvable in any certain language, the ICPC website states that \"the judges will have solved all problems in Java and C++\" for both regional and world finals competitions). Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified and can submit another program.\n\nThe winner is the team which correctly solves most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. <ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules</ref>\n\nFor example, consider a situation when two teams, Red and Blue, tie by solving two problems each. The team Red submitted their solutions to A and B at 1:00 and 2:45 after the beginning of the contest. They had a rejected run on C, but it was ignored since they didn't solve C. The team Blue submitted solutions to problems A and C at 1:20 and 2:00 after the beginning. They had one rejected run on C. Then, the total time is 1:00+2:45=3:45 for team Red and 1:20+2:00+0:20=3:40 for team Blue. The tie is broken in favor of Team Blue.\n\nCompared to other programming contests (for example, [[International Olympiad in Informatics]]), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (eight or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.\n\n== 2004-2019 finals ==\n\n=== 2004 World Finals ===\nThe 2004 ACM-ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum, [[Prague]], by [[Czech Technical University]] in Prague. 3,150 teams representing 1,411 universities from 75 countries competed in elimination rounds, with 73 of those teams proceeding to the world finals.

Headquartered at [[Baylor University]], directed by ICPC Executive Director and Baylor Professor Dr. William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates autonomous regional contests covering six continents culminating in a global World Finals every year.  In 2018, ICPC participation included 52,709 students from 3,233 universities in 110 countries.<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/pdf/Factsheet.pdf</ref>\n\nThe ICPC operates under the auspices of the [[ICPC Foundation]] and operates under agreements with host universities and non-profits, all in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures.<ref name=\"icpcpp\">https://icpc.baylor.edu/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf</ref> Since 1977 until 2017 ICPC was held under the auspices of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and was referred to as ACM-ICPC.<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/download/community/history/Factsheet-2017.pdf</ref>\n\nTracing its roots to 1970, over 320,000 ICPC alumni populate the professional ranks of high-tech companies, consulting firms, financial institutions, investment firms, high-tech startups, venture-capital firms, academia, and public service.<ref>https://www.quora.com/What-is-more-important-to-companies-like-Google-competitive-programming-skills-or-work-experience-in-programming/answer/Bill-Poucher</ref> ICPC Alumni are developers, software engineers, senior software engineers, leads, chiefs, CTOs, CEOs, founders, and co-founders. They are also professors, researchers, and in public service. A good number are in venture capital, helping others start companies.

ICPC competitions provide gifted students opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their teamwork, programming, and problem-solving process. The ICPC is a global platform for academia, industry, and community to shine the spotlight on and raise the aspirations of the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.<ref name=\"acmicpc1\">{{Cite web |url=https://acmicpc.org/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328102509/https://acmicpc.org/compete/ICPC-Policies-and-Procedures.pdf |archive-date=2018-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at [[Texas A&M University]] in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). This initial programming competition was titled First Annual Texas Collegiate Programming Championship and each University was represented by a team of up to five members. The computer used was a [[IBM System 360|360 model 65]] which was one of the first machines with a DAT (Dynamic Address Translator aka \"paging\") system for accessing memory. The start of the competition was delayed for about 90 minutes because two of the four \"memory bank\" amplifiers were down. Teams that participated included, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, University of Houston, and five or six other Texas University / Colleges. There were three problems that had to be completed and the cumulative time from \"start\" to \"successful completion\" determined first-, second-, and third-place winners. The programming language used was [[Fortran]]. The programs were written on coding sheets, keypunched on [[Hollerith card]]s, and submitted for execution.  The [[University of Houston]] team won the competition completing all three problems successfully with time. The second- and third-place teams did not successfully complete all three three problems. The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams of four from universities throughout the United States and Canada. Headquartered at [[Baylor University]] since 1989, with regional contests established within the world's university community, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition. To increase access to the World Finals, teams were reduced to three students within their first five academic years.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2017 [[IBM]] was the sponsor of ICPC. During that time contest participation has grown by more than 2000%. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2017, 46,381 students from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents participated in regional competitions. Organized as a highly localized extra-curricular university mind sport and operating as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits, the ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world.\n\nUPE has provided continuous support since 1970 and honored World Finalists since the first Finals in 1976. The ICPC is indebted to ACM member contributions and ACM assistance from 1976-2018. Baylor University has served since 1985, hosting ICPC Headquarters since 1989. The ICPC operates as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits to insure that participation in ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world. See ICPC Policies and Procedures.<ref name=\"icpcpp\"/>\n\nThe ICPC World Finals (The Annual World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest) is the final round of competition. Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide with 140 teams competing in the 2018 World Finals. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state. In recent years, media impressions have hovered at the one billion mark.\n\nSince 2000, only teams from [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Poland]] have won the ICPC world finals. Participation in [[North America]] is much smaller than in the rest of the world, which is partially attributed to the perceived low payoff of participating.<ref name=\"sigcse16\">{{cite journal |url=https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja/pubs/sigcse2016-programming-contests.pdf |title=A Programming Contest Strategy Guide |first1=Aaron |last1=Bloomfield |first2=Borja |last2=Sotomayor |journal=SIGCSE '16: Proceedings of the 47th ACM Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education }}</ref>\n\n==Contest rules==\nICPC contests are team competitions. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm|title=Information - ICPC|accessdate=2008-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080616223212/http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm| archivedate= 16 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Regionals/EligibilityDecisionTree.pdf|title=2008 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Decision Diagram|accessdate=2008-06-10|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nDuring each contest, the teams of three are given 5 hours to solve between eight and fifteen programming problems (with eight typical for regionals and twelve for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]],<ref>http://acmgnyr.org/year2019/rules.shtml</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44899|title=Python at ICPC world finals 2017 - Codeforces|website=Codeforces|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/rules_winter15.php|title=ACM ICPC meets FAU|last=team|first=ICPC|website=icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de|access-date=2016-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914122237/https://icpc.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/rules_winter15.php|archive-date=2016-09-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> or [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]]<ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment</ref> (although it is not guaranteed every problem is solvable in any certain language, the ICPC website states that \"the judges will have solved all problems in Java and C++\" for both regional and world finals competitions). Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified and can submit another program.\n\nThe winner is the team which correctly solves most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. <ref>https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules</ref>\n\nFor example, consider a situation when two teams, Red and Blue, tie by solving two problems each. The team Red submitted their solutions to A and B at 1:00 and 2:45 after the beginning of the contest. They had a rejected run on C, but it was ignored since they didn't solve C. The team Blue submitted solutions to problems A and C at 1:20 and 2:00 after the beginning. They had one rejected run on C. Then, the total time is 1:00+2:45=3:45 for team Red and 1:20+2:00+0:20=3:40 for team Blue. The tie is broken in favor of Team Blue.\n\nCompared to other programming contests (for example, [[International Olympiad in Informatics]]), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (eight or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.\n\n== 2004-2019 finals ==\n\n=== 2004 World Finals ===\nThe 2004 ACM-ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum, [[Prague]], by [[Czech Technical University]] in Prague. 3,150 teams representing 1,411 universities from 75 countries competed in elimination rounds, with 73 of those teams proceeding to the world finals.
