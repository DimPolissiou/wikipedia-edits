This association was hosted in a [[HLM]] in the area, and had to move to another building because the HLM was going to be destroyed. Al-Fath association works essentially for the Islamic and civic education, sportive events, releases and travels, assistant at the Muslims for administrative queries. For his removal, the association rent a terrain at the city of [[Besan\u00e7on]] for one symbolic euro, during 99&nbsp;years. For finance the construction of the building, Al-Fath association appeal the gift at the Muslims of the area. In 2008, the association was reinstalled and the first imam (mister Dahmani) took function.\n\nThe second mosque of Besan\u00e7on was built at the end of the 1990s, and is called the Sunna mosque. It is located in Saint-Claude area and has a [[minaret]].
