It is also thought to be the smallest racecourse of significance in England at 1 mile and 1 furlong (1.8&nbsp;km) long.\n\n==History==\nThe {{convert|65|acre|m2|sing=on}} racecourse lies on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The site was once a harbour during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of the city during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but was closed as the river [[silt]]ed up thus making navigation impossible. Towards the centre of the in field is a raised mound which is decorated by a small cross known as a \"[[rood]]\". It is from this that the race course derives the name \"Roodee\"; Roodee is a corruption of \"Rood Eye\", meaning \"The Island of the Cross\".\n\nAccording to legend the cross marks the burial site of a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] sentenced to hang after causing the death of Lady Trawst, the wife of the Governor of Hawarden. The legend states that she had gone to church to pray for rain but when her prayers were answered by a tremendous thunderstorm the statue was loosened and fell, killing her. As a holy object, hanging or burning the statue would be sacrilege so the statue was left by the banks of the river and the tide carried it down to Chester. The statue was found guilty by a jury of 12 men. If the legend is true, then this is the first recorded case of a jury being used in a court.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Feud, Glorious Feud|series=Tony Robinson's Crime and Punishment|airdate=1 June 2008|season=1}}</ref>\n\nIn an alternate version of the legend, the statue was instead carried to St John's Church. An ancient statue of the Virgin was recorded at the time of the reformation but may not be the same one. The statue was thrown down as a relic of popery, used as a whipping post for scholars and burned.\n\nThe site was formerly the home of the original [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]], temporarily banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] but finally abolished in 1677\n\nThe east of the race course abuts directly onto Chester's ancient [[city walls]] which were once used to moor [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trading vessels, before the course of the river changed. Spectators can watch races for free from the walls which offer a clear view of the whole circuit. The [[Grosvenor Bridge (Chester)|Grosvenor Bridge]], at one time the longest single arch bridge in the world, passes over the south-eastern corner. The north of the course is bordered by a long railway bridge carrying the [[North Wales Coast Line]] over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The course is overlooked from the opposite bank of the river by the [[mansions]] of [[Curzon Park]], which can be seen dominating the skyline from any of the three grandstands.\n\n==Horseracing==\n[[File:RoodeeAerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Racecourse.]]\nThe Chester Racecourse site was home to the famous and bloody Goteddsday [[Medi\u00e6val football|football]] match. The game was very violent and, in 1533, banned by the city, to be replaced in 1539 by horse racing. The first recorded race was held on 9 February 1539 (although other sources list this as 10 January 1511{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=108}}) with the consent of the Mayor Henry Gee, whose name led to the use of the term \"gee-gee\" for horses.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Races originally took place on Goteddsday ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) until 1609, and thereafter on [[St George's Day]], both major festivals during the [[medieval]] period. Victors were awarded the \"Chester Bells\", a set of decorative [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] for decorating the horse's [[bridle]], and from 1744 the \"[[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Grosvenor]] Gold Cup\", a small [[Cup|tumbler]] made from solid gold (later silver). In 1745, the meeting became a four-day one, with one race on each day.{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=110}}  In 1766 a May Festival was introduced, and in 1824, the Tradesmen's Cup Race (the predecessor to the [[Chester Cup]]) was also introduced.\n\nThe racecourse was at that point still just an open field, with the first [[grandstand]] finished in 1817 and the first admittance fee not being taken until 1897. The stand was rebuilt in 1899\u20131900, and was replaced after being destroyed by [[arson]] in 1985.\n\n==Today==\nThe racecourse's position in the city makes race meetings at Chester very popular as it is only a very short stroll to all the hotels, bars, shopping and restaurants. The racecourse itself is just over {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} long, flat and raced anti-clockwise or left-handed. The main characteristic of the course is the very short straight (239 yards). As such, long-strided horses, which perform better on straights, are at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nOn 19 August 2006, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Face to Face Tour]] supporting their album [[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]].\n\nIn 2008, a restaurant opened at the racecourse, named \"1539\", after the first year that horse racing took place in Chester.<ref>[http://www.restaurant1539.co.uk/ 1539 Restaurant]</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a new pub and restaurant called The White Horse was opened in the centre of the Course.\n\nThe main race meetings at Chester were often broadcast on [[Channel 4 Racing]] until 2016 and have been broadcast on [[ITV Racing]] since 2017.\n\nIn May 2012, all former [[The Tote|Tote]] betting positions were replaced by the racecourse's own in-house chesterBET betting system.\n\nThe Clerk of the Course is Andrew Morris, who is also Clerk of the Course for sister course [[Bangor-on-Dee racecourse|Bangor-on-Dee]], which is a [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] jumps course.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Notable races==\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"width:70px\" |Month\n! style=\"width:80px\" |Meeting\n! style=\"width:80px\" |DOW\n!

known as '''the Roodee''', is officially recognised by the Guinness World Records as the oldest [[racecourse]] still in operation [https://www.racingpost.com/news/chester-honoured-with-guinness-title-of-oldest-racecourse-still-in-operation/376566].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite

Telegraph]]|author=Marcus Armytage|date=6 May 2008|accessdate=9 May 2008}}</ref> [[Horse racing]] at [[Chester]] dates back to the early sixteenth century, with 1539 cited as the year racing began. It is also thought to be the smallest racecourse of significance in England at 1 mile and 1 furlong (1.8&nbsp;km) long.\n\n==History==\nThe {{convert|65|acre|m2|sing=on}} racecourse lies on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The site was once a harbour during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of the city during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but was closed as the river [[silt]]ed up thus making navigation impossible. Towards the centre of the in field is a raised mound which is decorated by a small cross known as a \"[[rood]]\". It is from this that the race course derives the name \"Roodee\"; Roodee is a corruption of \"Rood Eye\", meaning \"The Island of the Cross\".\n\nAccording to legend the cross marks the burial site of a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] sentenced to hang after causing the death of Lady Trawst, the wife of the Governor of Hawarden. The legend states that she had gone to church to pray for rain but when her prayers were answered by a tremendous thunderstorm the statue was loosened and fell, killing her. As a holy object, hanging or burning the statue would be sacrilege so the statue was left by the banks of the river and the tide carried it down to Chester. The statue was found guilty by a jury of 12 men. If the legend is true, then this is the first recorded case of a jury being used in a court.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Feud, Glorious Feud|series=Tony Robinson's Crime and Punishment|airdate=2008-06-01|season=1}}</ref>\n\nIn an alternate version of the legend, the statue was instead carried to St John's Church. An ancient statue of the Virgin was recorded at the time of the reformation but may not be the same one. The statue was thrown down as a relic of popery, used as a whipping post for scholars and burned.\n\nThe site was formerly the home of the original [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]], temporarily banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] but finally abolished in 1677\n\nThe east of the race course abuts directly onto Chester's ancient [[city walls]] which were once used to moor [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trading vessels, before the course of the river changed. Spectators can watch races for free from the walls which offer a clear view of the whole circuit. The [[Grosvenor Bridge (Chester)|Grosvenor Bridge]], at one time the longest single arch bridge in the world, passes over the south-eastern corner. The north of the course is bordered by a long railway bridge carrying the [[North Wales Coast Line]] over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The course is overlooked from the opposite bank of the river by the [[mansions]] of [[Curzon Park]], which can be seen dominating the skyline from any of the three grandstands.\n\n==Horseracing==\n[[File:RoodeeAerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Racecourse.]]\nThe Chester Racecourse site was home to the famous and bloody Goteddsday [[Medi\u00e6val football|football]] match. The game was very violent and, in 1533, banned by the city, to be replaced in 1539 by horse racing. The first recorded race was held on 9 February 1539 (although other sources list this as 10 January 1511{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=108}}) with the consent of the Mayor Henry Gee, whose name led to the use of the term \"gee-gee\" for horses.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Races originally took place on Goteddsday ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) until 1609, and thereafter on [[St George's Day]], both major festivals during the [[medieval]] period. Victors were awarded the \"Chester Bells\", a set of decorative [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] for decorating the horse's [[bridle]], and from 1744 the \"[[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Grosvenor]] Gold Cup\", a small [[Cup|tumbler]] made from solid gold (later silver). In 1745, the meeting became a four-day one, with one race on each day.{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=110}}  In 1766 a May Festival was introduced, and in 1824, the Tradesmen's Cup Race (the predecessor to the [[Chester Cup]]) was also introduced.\n\nThe racecourse was at that point still just an open field, with the first [[grandstand]] finished in 1817 and the first admittance fee not being taken until 1897. The stand was rebuilt in 1899\u20131900, and was replaced after being destroyed by [[arson]] in 1985.\n\n==Today==\nThe racecourse's position in the city makes race meetings at Chester very popular as it is only a very short stroll to all the hotels, bars, shopping and restaurants. The racecourse itself is just over {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} long, flat and raced anti-clockwise or left-handed. The main characteristic of the course is the very short straight (239 yards). As such, long-strided horses, which perform better on straights, are at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nOn 19 August 2006, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Face to Face Tour]] supporting their album [[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]].\n\nIn 2008, a restaurant opened at the racecourse, named \"1539\", after the first year that horse racing took place in Chester.<ref>[http://www.restaurant1539.co.uk/ 1539 Restaurant]</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a new pub and restaurant called The White Horse was opened in the centre of the Course.\n\nThe main race meetings at Chester were often broadcast on [[Channel 4 Racing]] until 2016 and have been broadcast on [[ITV Racing]] since 2017.\n\nIn May 2012, all former [[The Tote|Tote]] betting positions were replaced by the racecourse's own in-house chesterBET betting system.\n\nThe Clerk of the Course is Andrew Morris, who is also Clerk of the Course for sister course [[Bangor-on-Dee racecourse|Bangor-on-Dee]], which is a [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] jumps course.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Notable races==\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"width:70px\" |Month\n! style=\"width:80px\" |Meeting\n! style=\"width:80px\" |DOW\n!

The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows, such as ''[[Penn & Teller: Fool Us]]'' and ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]'', and is currently headlining in [[Las Vegas]] at [[The Rio]]. Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur.\n\nHe has published eight books, including the ''New York Times'' Bestseller, ''[[God, No!|God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]''. He is also known for his advocacy of [[atheism]], [[scientific skepticism]], the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[libertarianism]], and [[free-market capitalism]].\n\n==Early life==\nJillette was born in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]].

At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist [[James Randi]], and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious [[supernatural]] power.

He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob \"Bob\" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the [[a cappella]] comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]] at Noise New York called ''Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?).'' It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]'', but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, \"Oral Hygiene\".\n\nJillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band [[the Residents]] in 1983. The performance (titled ''[[The Mole Show Live at the Roxy|The Mole Show]]'' and based on their \"Mole trilogy\" of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling [[shaggy dog story|long and intentionally pointless stories]]. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents.\n\nJillette was a contributor to the now-defunct ''[[PC/Computing]]'' magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994.\n\nJillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network [[Comedy Central]] in the 1990s.<ref name=\"nbc-ident-bio\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nbc.com/Identity/host.shtml| title = ''Identity'': Penn Jillette|publisher=[[NBC]]| accessdate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywood.com\">{{cite web| url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Penn_Jillette/1350693| title = Penn Jillette: Full Biography| work=Hollywood.com|accessdate = June 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] and dubbed it \"The Slammer\".<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news|last=Tschorn|first=Adam|title=Welcome to the Slammer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/22/home/hm-jillette22?pg=1|accessdate=October 18, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 22, 2004}}</ref>\nIt has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers.

He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with [[Debbie Harry]] as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend [[Nell Scovell]].\n\nPenn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', \"The Day of the Dead\", written by [[Neil Gaiman]].\n\nFor a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the [[search engine]] [[Excite.com]]. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the [[Penn & Teller]] duo he was. (For example: \"Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports.\") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words.

In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem \"[[bullshit]]\".\n\nIn 2005 with actor [[Paul Provenza]], Jillette co-produced and co-directed ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as [[The Aristocrats (joke)|\"The Aristocrats\"]]. It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke.\n\nFrom January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow [[atheist]], [[skeptic]], and [[juggler]] [[Michael Goudeau]], a live, hour-long [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast on [[Free FM]]. The show, ''[[Penn Radio]]'', broadcast from his [[#Vintage Nudes Studio|Vintage Nudes Studio]] in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was \"[[Monkey Tuesday]]\" and later \"The Pull of the Weasel\". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a \"show biz wimp\" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children.\n\nDuring the 2006\u201307 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]'' on [[NBC]].\n\nIn 2008, Jillette was a contestant on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 6)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', paired with professional dancer [[Kym Johnson]].

The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows, such as ''[[Penn & Teller: Fool Us]]'' and ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]'', and is currently headlining in [[Las Vegas]] at [[The Rio]]. Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur.\n\nHe has published eight books, including the ''New York Times'' Bestseller, ''[[God, No!|God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]''. He is also known for his advocacy of [[atheism]], [[scientific skepticism]], the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[libertarianism]], and [[free-market capitalism]].\n\n==Early life==\nJillette was born in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]].

At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist [[James Randi]], and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious [[supernatural]] power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.<ref name=\"skepticalitynov2012\">{{cite podcast| url = http://www.skepticality.com/jill-jet-and-the-magical-tale-of-penn/| title = Jill-Jet: And The Magical Tale of Penn|website = Skepticality| publisher = [[Skepticality]]| host = [[Derek Colanduno]]| date = November 27, 2012| accessdate = June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nJillette worked with [[high school]] classmate [[Michael Moschen]] in developing and performing a juggling act during the years immediately following their 1973 graduation.<ref name=\"New Yorker-Trillin-1989\"/> In 1974, Jillette graduated from [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College]].<ref name=\"slate\">\n{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135432/ |title=Penn Jillette: The magician-comedian-writer's secrets revealed! |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=February 4, 2006 |first=Bryan |last=Curtis |accessdate=June 29, 2007}}</ref> That same year, he was introduced to [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] by Weir Chrisemer, a mutual friend.<ref name=\"P&T-faq\"/> The three then formed a three-person act called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society which played in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] and San Francisco.<ref name=\"New Yorker-Trillin-1989\"/> In 1981, he and Teller teamed up as [[Penn & Teller]], and went on to do a successful [[Off Broadway]] and later [[Broadway theatre]] show called \"Penn & Teller\" that toured nationally.<ref name=\"New Yorker-Trillin-1989\"/>\n\n==Career==\nWhile the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob \"Bob\" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the [[a cappella]] comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]] at Noise New York called ''Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?).'' It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]'', but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, \"Oral Hygiene\".\n\nJillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band [[the Residents]] in 1983. The performance (titled ''[[The Mole Show Live at the Roxy|The Mole Show]]'' and based on their \"Mole trilogy\" of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling [[shaggy dog story|long and intentionally pointless stories]]. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents.\n\nJillette was a contributor to the now-defunct ''[[PC/Computing]]'' magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994.\n\nJillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network [[Comedy Central]] in the 1990s.<ref name=\"nbc-ident-bio\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nbc.com/Identity/host.shtml| title = ''Identity'': Penn Jillette|publisher=[[NBC]]| accessdate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywood.com\">{{cite web| url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Penn_Jillette/1350693| title = Penn Jillette: Full Biography| work=Hollywood.com|accessdate = June 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] and dubbed it \"The Slammer\".<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news|last=Tschorn|first=Adam|title=Welcome to the Slammer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/22/home/hm-jillette22?pg=1|accessdate=October 18, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 22, 2004}}</ref>\nIt has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers.

He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with [[Debbie Harry]] as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend [[Nell Scovell]].\n\nPenn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', \"The Day of the Dead\", written by [[Neil Gaiman]].\n\nFor a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the [[search engine]] [[Excite.com]]. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the [[Penn & Teller]] duo he was. (For example: \"Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports.\") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com.<ref name=\"penn-columns\">{{cite web| url = http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| title = \"Penn's Columns\" (index)| publisher = PennAndTeller.com| accessdate = October 12, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202202011/http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| archivedate = February 2, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]'' on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem \"[[bullshit]]\".\n\nIn 2005 with actor [[Paul Provenza]], Jillette co-produced and co-directed ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as [[The Aristocrats (joke)|\"The Aristocrats\"]]. It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke.\n\nFrom January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow [[atheist]], [[skeptic]], and [[juggler]] [[Michael Goudeau]], a live, hour-long [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast on [[Free FM]]. The show, ''[[Penn Radio]]'', broadcast from his [[#Vintage Nudes Studio|Vintage Nudes Studio]] in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was \"[[Monkey Tuesday]]\" and later \"The Pull of the Weasel\". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a \"show biz wimp\" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children.\n\nDuring the 2006\u201307 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]'' on [[NBC]].\n\nIn 2008, Jillette was a contestant on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 6)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', paired with professional dancer [[Kym Johnson]]. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated.

Furthermore, spyware asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge, sending confidential information to another entity with the consumer's consent, through [[HTTP cookie|cookies]].<ref name=\"FTC-REPORT-2005\">FTC Report  (2005). \"[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf]\"</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Overview ==\nSpyware is mostly classified into four types: [[adware]], system monitors, tracking [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], and [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]];<ref name=\"Shin\">SPYWARE \"{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/e-journal/pdf/cybercrime_essay.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101154446/https://www.justice.gov.tr/e-journal/pdf/cybercrime_essay.pdf|archivedate=November 1, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-02-05|df=}}\"</ref> examples of other notorious types include [[digital rights management]] capabilities that \"phone home\", [[keylogger]]s, [[rootkit]]s, and [[web beacons]].\n\nSpyware is mostly used for the stealing information and storing Internet users' movements on the Web and serving up pop-up ads to Internet users. Whenever spyware is used for malicious purposes, its presence is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Some spyware, such as [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], may be installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or [[public computer]] intentionally in order to monitor users.\n\nWhile the term ''spyware'' suggests software that monitors a user's computing, the functions of spyware can extend beyond simple monitoring. Spyware can collect almost any type of data, including personal information like [[internet surfing]] habits, user logins, and bank or credit account information. Spyware can also interfere with a user's control of a computer by installing additional software or redirecting [[web browser]]s. Some spyware can change computer settings, which can result in slow Internet connection speeds, un-authorized changes in browser settings, or changes to software settings.\n\nSometimes, spyware is included along with genuine software, and may come from a malicious website or may have been added to the intentional functionality of genuine software (see the paragraph about [[Facebook]], below). In response to the emergence of spyware, a small industry has sprung up dealing in [[anti-spyware]] software. Running anti-spyware software has become a widely recognized element of [[computer security]] practices, especially for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]]. A number of jurisdictions have passed anti-spyware laws, which usually target any software that is surreptitiously installed to control a user's computer.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is called ''govware'' by computer experts (in common parlance: ''Regierungstrojaner'', literally \"Government Trojan\"). Govware is typically a trojan horse software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries, like Switzerland and Germany, have a legal framework governing the use of such software.<ref>Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419\u2013428</ref><ref>[http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html FAQ \u2013 H\u00e4ufig gestellte Fragen<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506102113/http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html |date=May 6, 2013 }}</ref> In the US, the term \"[[policeware]]\" has been used for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070719-will-security-firms-avoid-detecting-government-spyware.html |title=The tricky issue of spyware with a badge: meet 'policeware' |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=July 20, 2007 |website=Ars Technica}}</ref>\n\nUse of the term \"spyware\" has eventually declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices ''per se'', but by the default settings created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, on a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of [[web tracking|tracking users' browsing activity]], linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: \"Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is ''New York Times''. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say you moved on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back who you are and that you went there.\" The'' WSJ'' analysis was researched by Brian Kennish, founder of Disconnect, Inc.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooley |first=Brian |url=https://www.cnet.com/videos/like-tweet-buttons-divulge-sites-you-visit/ |title='Like,' 'tweet' buttons divulge sites you visit: CNET News Video |work=CNet News |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Routes of infection==\n\nSpyware does not necessarily spread in the same way as a [[Computer virus|virus]] or [[Computer worm|worm]] because infected systems generally do not attempt to transmit or copy the software to other computers. Instead, spyware installs itself on a system by deceiving the user or by [[Exploit (computer security)|exploiting]] software vulnerabilities.\n\nMost spyware is installed without  knowledge, or by using deceptive tactics. Spyware may try to deceive users by bundling itself with desirable software. Other common tactics are using a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]], spy gadgets that look like normal devices but turn out to be something else, such as a USB Keylogger. These devices actually are connected to the device as memory units but are capable of recording each stroke made on the keyboard. Some spyware authors infect a system through security holes in the Web browser or in other software. When the user navigates to a Web page controlled by the spyware author, the page contains code which attacks the browser and forces the download and installation of spyware.\n\nThe installation of spyware frequently involves [[Internet Explorer]]. Its popularity and history of security issues have made it a frequent target. Its deep integration with the Windows environment make it susceptible to attack into the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]. [[Internet Explorer]] also serves as a point of attachment for spyware in the form of [[Browser Helper Object]]s, which modify the browser's behaviour.\n\n==Effects and behaviors==\n{{One source section|date=December 2018}}\nA spyware rarely operates alone on a computer; an affected machine usually has multiple infections. Users frequently notice unwanted behavior and degradation of system performance. A spyware infestation can create significant unwanted [[central processing unit|CPU]] activity, disk usage, and network traffic. Stability issues, such as applications freezing, failure to boot, and system-wide crashes are also common. Spyware, which interferes with networking software commonly causes difficulty connecting to the Internet.\n\nIn some infections, the spyware is not even evident. Users assume in those situations that the performance issues relate to faulty hardware, Windows installation problems, or another [[malware]] infection. Some owners of badly infected systems resort to contacting [[technical support]] experts, or even buying a new computer because the existing system \"has become too slow\". Badly infected systems may require a clean reinstallation of all their software in order to return to full functionality.\n\nMoreover, some types of spyware disable software [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and [[antivirus software]], and/or reduce browser security settings, which opens the system to further [[opportunistic infection]]s. Some spyware disables or even removes competing spyware programs, on the grounds that more spyware-related annoyances increase the likelihood that users will take action to remove the programs.<ref name=\"competitor removal\">Edelman, Ben; December 7, 2004 (updated February 8, 2005); [http://www.benedelman.org/news/120704-1.html Direct Revenue Deletes Competitors from Users' Disks]; benedelman.com. Retrieved November 28, 2006.</ref>\n\n[[Keylogger]]s are sometimes part of malware packages downloaded onto computers without the owners' knowledge. Some keylogger software is freely available on the internet, while others are commercial or private applications. Most keyloggers allow not only keyboard keystrokes to be captured, they also are often capable of collecting screen captures from the computer.\n\nA typical Windows user has [[administrative privileges]], mostly for convenience. Because of this, any program the user runs has unrestricted access to the system. As with other [[operating system]]s, Windows users are able to follow the [[principle of least privilege]] and use non-[[administrative privileges|administrator]] accounts. Alternatively, they can reduce the [[Privilege (computing)|privileges]] of specific vulnerable Internet-facing [[Process (computing)|processes]], such as [[Internet Explorer]].\n\nSince [[Windows Vista]] is, by default, a computer administrator that runs everything under limited user privileges, when a program requires administrative privileges, a [[User Account Control]] pop-up will prompt the user to allow or deny the action. This improves on the design used by previous versions of Windows.\n\n==Remedies and prevention==\n{{see also|Computer virus#Virus removal}}\nAs the spyware threat has evolved, a number of techniques have emerged to counteract it. These include programs designed to remove or block spyware, as well as various user practices which reduce the chance of getting spyware on a system.\n\nNonetheless, spyware remains a costly problem. When a large number of pieces of spyware have infected a Windows computer, the only remedy may involve [[Backup|backing up]] user data, and fully reinstalling the [[operating system]]. For instance, some spyware cannot be completely removed by Symantec, Microsoft, PC Tools.\n\n===Anti-spyware programs===\n{{see also|Category:Spyware removal}}\nMany programmers and some commercial firms have released products dedicated to remove or block spyware. Programs such as PC Tools' [[Spyware Doctor]], Lavasoft's ''[[Ad-Aware SE]]'' and Patrick Kolla's ''[[Spybot - Search & Destroy]]'' rapidly gained popularity as tools to remove, and in some cases intercept, spyware programs.  On December 16, 2004, [[Microsoft]] acquired the ''[[Windows Defender|GIANT AntiSpyware]]'' software,<ref>\"{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Acquires Anti-Spyware Leader GIANT Company |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227020238/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.mspx |archivedate=February 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}\"</ref> rebranding it as ''Windows AntiSpyware beta'' and releasing it as a free download for Genuine Windows XP and Windows 2003 users. (In 2006 it was renamed [[Windows Defender]]).\n\nMajor anti-virus firms such as [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]], [[PC Tools (company)|PC Tools]], [[McAfee]] and [[Sophos]] have also added anti-spyware features to their existing anti-virus products. Early on, anti-virus firms expressed reluctance to add anti-spyware functions, citing lawsuits brought by spyware authors against the authors of web sites and programs which described their products as \"spyware\". However, recent versions of these major firms home and business anti-virus products do include anti-spyware functions, albeit treated differently from viruses. Symantec Anti-Virus, for instance, categorizes spyware programs as \"extended threats\" and now offers [[real-time protection]] against these threats.\n\n===How anti-spyware software works===\nAnti-spyware programs can combat spyware in two ways:\n# They can provide [[Real time protection|real-time protection]] in a manner similar to that of [[Anti virus|anti-virus]] protection: they scan all incoming [[computer network|network]] data for spyware and blocks any threats it detects.\n# Anti-spyware software programs can be used solely for detection and removal of spyware software that has already been installed into the computer. This kind of anti-spyware can often be set to scan on a regular schedule.\nSuch programs inspect the contents of the [[Windows registry]], [[operating system]] files, and [[software|installed programs]], and remove files and entries which match a list of known spyware. Real-time protection from spyware works identically to real-time anti-virus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent spyware.\nIn some cases, it may also intercept attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Earlier versions of anti-spyware programs focused chiefly on detection and removal. Javacool Software's [[SpywareBlaster]], one of the first to offer real-time protection, blocked the installation of [[ActiveX]]-based spyware.\n\nLike most anti-virus software, many anti-spyware/adware tools require a frequently updated database of threats. As new spyware programs are released, anti-spyware developers discover and evaluate them, adding to the list of known spyware, which allows the software to detect and remove new spyware. As a result, anti-spyware software is of limited usefulness without regular updates. Updates may be installed automatically or manually.\n\nA popular generic spyware removal tool used by those that requires a certain degree of expertise is [[HijackThis]], which scans certain areas of the Windows OS where spyware often resides and presents a list with items to delete manually. As most of the items are legitimate windows files/registry entries it is advised for those who are less knowledgeable on this subject to post a HijackThis log on the numerous antispyware sites and let the experts decide what to delete.\n\nIf a spyware program is not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist attempts to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in [[safe mode]] allows an anti-spyware program a better chance of removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.\n\n===Security practices===\nTo detect spyware, computer users have found several practices useful in addition to installing anti-spyware programs.  Many users have installed a [[web browser]] other than [[Internet Explorer]], such as [[Mozilla Firefox]] or [[Google Chrome]]. Though no browser is completely safe, Internet Explorer was once at a greater risk for spyware infection due to its large user base as well as vulnerabilities such as [[ActiveX]] but these three major browsers are now close to equivalent when it comes to security.<ref>Stefan Frei, Thomas Duebendofer, Gunter Ollman, and Martin May, [http://www.codeengn.com/archive/Conference/Defcon/16/Understanding%20the%20Web%20browser%20threat%5Bfrei-panel%5D.pdf Understanding the Web browser threat: Examination of vulnerable online Web browser populations and the insecurity iceberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911181857/http://www.codeengn.com/archive/Conference/Defcon/16/Understanding%20the%20Web%20browser%20threat%5Bfrei-panel%5D.pdf |date=September 11, 2016 }}, Communication Systems Group, 2008</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= Security Busters: Web Browser security vs. rogue sites|journal= Computers & Security|volume= 52|pages= 90\u2013105|doi= 10.1016/j.cose.2015.04.009|year= 2015|last1= Virvilis|first1= Nikos|last2= Mylonas|first2= Alexios|last3= Tsalis|first3= Nikolaos|last4= Gritzalis|first4= Dimitris}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s\u2014particularly colleges and universities\u2014have taken a different approach to blocking spyware: they use their network [[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]s and [[web proxy|web proxies]] to block access to Web sites known to install spyware.

These monitor the flow of information going to and from a networked computer and provide protection against spyware and malware.  Some users install a large [[hosts file]] which prevents the user's computer from connecting to known spyware-related web addresses.  Spyware may get installed via certain [[shareware]] programs offered for download.

Stealware diverts the payment of [[affiliate marketing]] revenues from the legitimate affiliate to the spyware vendor.\n\nSpyware which attacks [[affiliate network]]s places the spyware operator's affiliate tag on the user's activity \u2013 replacing any other tag, if there is one. The spyware operator is the only party that gains from this. The user has their choices thwarted, a legitimate affiliate loses revenue, networks' reputations are injured, and vendors are harmed by having to pay out affiliate revenues to an \"affiliate\" who is not party to a contract.<ref name=\"edelman-180\">Edelman, Ben (2004). \"[http://www.benedelman.org/spyware/180-affiliates/ The Effect of 180solutions on Affiliate Commissions and Merchants]\".

Note that as with computer viruses, researchers give names to spyware programs which may not be used by their creators. Programs may be grouped into \"families\" based not on shared program code, but on common behaviors, or by \"following the money\" of apparent financial or business connections. For instance, a number of the spyware programs distributed by [[Claria]] are collectively known as \"Gator\". Likewise, programs that are frequently installed together may be described as parts of the same spyware package, even if they function separately.\n\n<!-- NOTE: Please avoid turning this into an unmaintainable list of \"all known spyware\".

The combination of user ignorance about these changes, and the assumption by [[Internet Explorer]] that all [[ActiveX]] components are benign, helped to spread spyware significantly. Many spyware components would also make use of [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s in [[JavaScript]], Internet Explorer and Windows to install without user knowledge or permission.\n\nThe [[Windows Registry]] contains multiple sections where modification of key values allows software to be executed automatically when the operating system boots. Spyware can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The spyware typically will link itself from each location in the [[Windows Registry|registry]] that allows execution. Once running, the spyware will periodically check if any of these links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the spyware will execute when the operating system is booted, even if some (or most) of the registry links are removed.\n\n==Programs distributed with spyware==\n<!-- LIST ONLY SOFTWARE NOTABLE ENOUGH TO HAVE ITS OWN ARTICLE, AND CITE SOURCES. -->\n* [[Kazaa]]<ref>Edelman, Ben (2004). \"[http://www.benedelman.org/spyware/claria-license/ Claria License Agreement Is Fifty Six Pages Long]\".

The school loaded each student's computer with [[LANrev]]'s remote activation tracking software.  This included the now-discontinued \"TheftTrack\".

The LANrev software disabled the webcams for all other uses (''e.g.'', students were unable to use [[Photo Booth]] or [[video chat]]), so most students mistakenly believed their webcams did not work at all.

Furthermore, spyware asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge, sending confidential information to another entity with the consumer's consent, through [[HTTP cookie|cookies]].<ref name=\"FTC-REPORT-2005\">FTC Report  (2005). \"[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf]\"</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Overview ==\nSpyware is mostly classified into four types: [[adware]], system monitors, tracking [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], and [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]];<ref name=\"Shin\">SPYWARE \"{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/e-journal/pdf/cybercrime_essay.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101154446/https://www.justice.gov.tr/e-journal/pdf/cybercrime_essay.pdf|archivedate=November 1, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-02-05|df=}}\"</ref> examples of other notorious types include [[digital rights management]] capabilities that \"phone home\", [[keylogger]]s, [[rootkit]]s, and [[web beacons]].\n\nSpyware is mostly used for the stealing information and storing Internet users' movements on the Web and serving up pop-up ads to Internet users. Whenever spyware is used for malicious purposes, its presence is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Some spyware, such as [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], may be installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or [[public computer]] intentionally in order to monitor users.\n\nWhile the term ''spyware'' suggests software that monitors a user's computing, the functions of spyware can extend beyond simple monitoring. Spyware can collect almost any type of data, including personal information like [[internet surfing]] habits, user logins, and bank or credit account information. Spyware can also interfere with a user's control of a computer by installing additional software or redirecting [[web browser]]s. Some spyware can change computer settings, which can result in slow Internet connection speeds, un-authorized changes in browser settings, or changes to software settings.\n\nSometimes, spyware is included along with genuine software, and may come from a malicious website or may have been added to the intentional functionality of genuine software (see the paragraph about [[Facebook]], below). In response to the emergence of spyware, a small industry has sprung up dealing in [[anti-spyware]] software. Running anti-spyware software has become a widely recognized element of [[computer security]] practices, especially for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]]. A number of jurisdictions have passed anti-spyware laws, which usually target any software that is surreptitiously installed to control a user's computer.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is called ''govware'' by computer experts (in common parlance: ''Regierungstrojaner'', literally \"Government Trojan\"). Govware is typically a trojan horse software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries, like Switzerland and Germany, have a legal framework governing the use of such software.<ref>Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419\u2013428</ref><ref>[http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html FAQ \u2013 H\u00e4ufig gestellte Fragen<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506102113/http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html |date=May 6, 2013 }}</ref> In the US, the term \"[[policeware]]\" has been used for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070719-will-security-firms-avoid-detecting-government-spyware.html |title=The tricky issue of spyware with a badge: meet 'policeware' |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=July 20, 2007 |website=Ars Technica}}</ref>\n\nUse of the term \"spyware\" has eventually declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices ''per se'', but by the default settings created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, on a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of [[web tracking|tracking users' browsing activity]], linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: \"Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is ''New York Times''. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say you moved on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back who you are and that you went there.\" The'' WSJ'' analysis was researched by Brian Kennish, founder of Disconnect, Inc.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooley |first=Brian |url=https://www.cnet.com/videos/like-tweet-buttons-divulge-sites-you-visit/ |title='Like,' 'tweet' buttons divulge sites you visit: CNET News Video |work=CNet News |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Routes of infection==\n\nSpyware does not necessarily spread in the same way as a [[Computer virus|virus]] or [[Computer worm|worm]] because infected systems generally do not attempt to transmit or copy the software to other computers. Instead, spyware installs itself on a system by deceiving the user or by [[Exploit (computer security)|exploiting]] software vulnerabilities.\n\nMost spyware is installed without  knowledge, or by using deceptive tactics. Spyware may try to deceive users by bundling itself with desirable software. Other common tactics are using a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]], spy gadgets that look like normal devices but turn out to be something else, such as a USB Keylogger. These devices actually are connected to the device as memory units but are capable of recording each stroke made on the keyboard. Some spyware authors infect a system through security holes in the Web browser or in other software. When the user navigates to a Web page controlled by the spyware author, the page contains code which attacks the browser and forces the download and installation of spyware.\n\nThe installation of spyware frequently involves [[Internet Explorer]]. Its popularity and history of security issues have made it a frequent target. Its deep integration with the Windows environment make it susceptible to attack into the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]. [[Internet Explorer]] also serves as a point of attachment for spyware in the form of [[Browser Helper Object]]s, which modify the browser's behaviour.\n\n==Effects and behaviors==\n{{One source section|date=December 2018}}\nA spyware rarely operates alone on a computer; an affected machine usually has multiple infections. Users frequently notice unwanted behavior and degradation of system performance. A spyware infestation can create significant unwanted [[central processing unit|CPU]] activity, disk usage, and network traffic. Stability issues, such as applications freezing, failure to boot, and system-wide crashes are also common. Spyware, which interferes with networking software commonly causes difficulty connecting to the Internet.\n\nIn some infections, the spyware is not even evident. Users assume in those situations that the performance issues relate to faulty hardware, Windows installation problems, or another [[malware]] infection. Some owners of badly infected systems resort to contacting [[technical support]] experts, or even buying a new computer because the existing system \"has become too slow\". Badly infected systems may require a clean reinstallation of all their software in order to return to full functionality.\n\nMoreover, some types of spyware disable software [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and [[antivirus software]], and/or reduce browser security settings, which opens the system to further [[opportunistic infection]]s. Some spyware disables or even removes competing spyware programs, on the grounds that more spyware-related annoyances increase the likelihood that users will take action to remove the programs.<ref name=\"competitor removal\">Edelman, Ben; December 7, 2004 (updated February 8, 2005); [http://www.benedelman.org/news/120704-1.html Direct Revenue Deletes Competitors from Users' Disks]; benedelman.com. Retrieved November 28, 2006.</ref>\n\n[[Keylogger]]s are sometimes part of malware packages downloaded onto computers without the owners' knowledge. Some keylogger software is freely available on the internet, while others are commercial or private applications. Most keyloggers allow not only keyboard keystrokes to be captured, they also are often capable of collecting screen captures from the computer.\n\nA typical Windows user has [[administrative privileges]], mostly for convenience. Because of this, any program the user runs has unrestricted access to the system. As with other [[operating system]]s, Windows users are able to follow the [[principle of least privilege]] and use non-[[administrative privileges|administrator]] accounts. Alternatively, they can reduce the [[Privilege (computing)|privileges]] of specific vulnerable Internet-facing [[Process (computing)|processes]], such as [[Internet Explorer]].\n\nSince [[Windows Vista]] is, by default, a computer administrator that runs everything under limited user privileges, when a program requires administrative privileges, a [[User Account Control]] pop-up will prompt the user to allow or deny the action. This improves on the design used by previous versions of Windows.\n\n==Remedies and prevention==\n{{see also|Computer virus#Virus removal}}\nAs the spyware threat has evolved, a number of techniques have emerged to counteract it. These include programs designed to remove or block spyware, as well as various user practices which reduce the chance of getting spyware on a system.\n\nNonetheless, spyware remains a costly problem. When a large number of pieces of spyware have infected a Windows computer, the only remedy may involve [[Backup|backing up]] user data, and fully reinstalling the [[operating system]]. For instance, some spyware cannot be completely removed by Symantec, Microsoft, PC Tools.\n\n===Anti-spyware programs===\n{{see also|Category:Spyware removal}}\nMany programmers and some commercial firms have released products dedicated to remove or block spyware. Programs such as PC Tools' [[Spyware Doctor]], Lavasoft's ''[[Ad-Aware SE]]'' and Patrick Kolla's ''[[Spybot - Search & Destroy]]'' rapidly gained popularity as tools to remove, and in some cases intercept, spyware programs.  On December 16, 2004, [[Microsoft]] acquired the ''[[Windows Defender|GIANT AntiSpyware]]'' software,<ref>\"{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Acquires Anti-Spyware Leader GIANT Company |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227020238/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.mspx |archivedate=February 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}\"</ref> rebranding it as ''Windows AntiSpyware beta'' and releasing it as a free download for Genuine Windows XP and Windows 2003 users. (In 2006 it was renamed [[Windows Defender]]).\n\nMajor anti-virus firms such as [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]], [[PC Tools (company)|PC Tools]], [[McAfee]] and [[Sophos]] have also added anti-spyware features to their existing anti-virus products. Early on, anti-virus firms expressed reluctance to add anti-spyware functions, citing lawsuits brought by spyware authors against the authors of web sites and programs which described their products as \"spyware\". However, recent versions of these major firms home and business anti-virus products do include anti-spyware functions, albeit treated differently from viruses. Symantec Anti-Virus, for instance, categorizes spyware programs as \"extended threats\" and now offers [[real-time protection]] against these threats.\n\n===How anti-spyware software works===\nAnti-spyware programs can combat spyware in two ways:\n# They can provide [[Real time protection|real-time protection]] in a manner similar to that of [[Anti virus|anti-virus]] protection: they scan all incoming [[computer network|network]] data for spyware and blocks any threats it detects.\n# Anti-spyware software programs can be used solely for detection and removal of spyware software that has already been installed into the computer. This kind of anti-spyware can often be set to scan on a regular schedule.\nSuch programs inspect the contents of the [[Windows registry]], [[operating system]] files, and [[software|installed programs]], and remove files and entries which match a list of known spyware. Real-time protection from spyware works identically to real-time anti-virus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent spyware.\nIn some cases, it may also intercept attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Earlier versions of anti-spyware programs focused chiefly on detection and removal. Javacool Software's [[SpywareBlaster]], one of the first to offer real-time protection, blocked the installation of [[ActiveX]]-based spyware.\n\nLike most anti-virus software, many anti-spyware/adware tools require a frequently updated database of threats. As new spyware programs are released, anti-spyware developers discover and evaluate them, adding to the list of known spyware, which allows the software to detect and remove new spyware. As a result, anti-spyware software is of limited usefulness without regular updates. Updates may be installed automatically or manually.\n\nA popular generic spyware removal tool used by those that requires a certain degree of expertise is [[HijackThis]], which scans certain areas of the Windows OS where spyware often resides and presents a list with items to delete manually. As most of the items are legitimate windows files/registry entries it is advised for those who are less knowledgeable on this subject to post a HijackThis log on the numerous antispyware sites and let the experts decide what to delete.\n\nIf a spyware program is not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist attempts to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in [[safe mode]] allows an anti-spyware program a better chance of removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.\n\n===Security practices===\nTo detect spyware, computer users have found several practices useful in addition to installing anti-spyware programs.  Many users have installed a [[web browser]] other than [[Internet Explorer]], such as [[Mozilla Firefox]] or [[Google Chrome]]. Though no browser is completely safe, Internet Explorer was once at a greater risk for spyware infection due to its large user base as well as vulnerabilities such as [[ActiveX]] but these three major browsers are now close to equivalent when it comes to security.<ref>Stefan Frei, Thomas Duebendofer, Gunter Ollman, and Martin May, [http://www.codeengn.com/archive/Conference/Defcon/16/Understanding%20the%20Web%20browser%20threat%5Bfrei-panel%5D.pdf Understanding the Web browser threat: Examination of vulnerable online Web browser populations and the insecurity iceberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911181857/http://www.codeengn.com/archive/Conference/Defcon/16/Understanding%20the%20Web%20browser%20threat%5Bfrei-panel%5D.pdf |date=September 11, 2016 }}, Communication Systems Group, 2008</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= Security Busters: Web Browser security vs. rogue sites|journal= Computers & Security|volume= 52|pages= 90\u2013105|doi= 10.1016/j.cose.2015.04.009|year= 2015|last1= Virvilis|first1= Nikos|last2= Mylonas|first2= Alexios|last3= Tsalis|first3= Nikolaos|last4= Gritzalis|first4= Dimitris}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s\u2014particularly colleges and universities\u2014have taken a different approach to blocking spyware: they use their network [[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]s and [[web proxy|web proxies]] to block access to Web sites known to install spyware. On March 31, 2005, [[Cornell University]]'s Information Technology department released a report detailing the behavior of one particular piece of proxy-based spyware, ''[[Marketscore]]'', and the steps the university took to intercept it.<ref>Schuster, Steve. \"{{cite web |url=http://www.cit.cornell.edu/computer/security/marketscore/MarketScore_rev2.html |title= Blocking Marketscore: Why Cornell Did It |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214111921/http://www.cit.cornell.edu/computer/security/marketscore/MarketScore_rev2.html |archivedate=February 14, 2007}}\".

March 31, 2005.</ref> Many other educational institutions have taken similar steps.\n\nIndividual users can also install [[Personal firewall|firewalls]] from a variety of companies.  These monitor the flow of information going to and from a networked computer and provide protection against spyware and malware.  Some users install a large [[hosts file]] which prevents the user's computer from connecting to known spyware-related web addresses.  Spyware may get installed via certain [[shareware]] programs offered for download.

The spyware operator is the only party that gains from this. The user has their choices thwarted, a legitimate affiliate loses revenue, networks' reputations are injured, and vendors are harmed by having to pay out affiliate revenues to an \"affiliate\" who is not party to a contract.<ref name=\"edelman-180\">Edelman, Ben (2004). \"[http://www.benedelman.org/spyware/180-affiliates/ The Effect of 180solutions on Affiliate Commissions and Merchants]\".

Programs may be grouped into \"families\" based not on shared program code, but on common behaviors, or by \"following the money\" of apparent financial or business connections. For instance, a number of the spyware programs distributed by [[Claria]] are collectively known as \"Gator\". Likewise, programs that are frequently installed together may be described as parts of the same spyware package, even if they function separately.\n\n<!-- NOTE: Please avoid turning this into an unmaintainable list of \"all known spyware\".

The combination of user ignorance about these changes, and the assumption by [[Internet Explorer]] that all [[ActiveX]] components are benign, helped to spread spyware significantly. Many spyware components would also make use of [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s in [[JavaScript]], Internet Explorer and Windows to install without user knowledge or permission.\n\nThe [[Windows Registry]] contains multiple sections where modification of key values allows software to be executed automatically when the operating system boots. Spyware can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The spyware typically will link itself from each location in the [[Windows Registry|registry]] that allows execution. Once running, the spyware will periodically check if any of these links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the spyware will execute when the operating system is booted, even if some (or most) of the registry links are removed.\n\n==Programs distributed with spyware==\n<!-- LIST ONLY SOFTWARE NOTABLE ENOUGH TO HAVE ITS OWN ARTICLE, AND CITE SOURCES. -->\n* [[Kazaa]]<ref>Edelman, Ben (2004). \"[http://www.benedelman.org/spyware/claria-license/ Claria License Agreement Is Fifty Six Pages Long]\".

In one case, that against Seismic Entertainment Productions, the FTC accused the defendants of developing a program that seized control of PCs nationwide, infected them with spyware and other malicious software, bombarded them with a barrage of pop-up advertising for Seismic's clients, exposed the PCs to security risks, and caused them to malfunction. Seismic then offered to sell the victims an \"antispyware\" program to fix the computers, and stop the popups and other problems that Seismic had caused.

From Anywhere.\" The FTC has obtained a temporary order prohibiting the defendants from selling the software and disconnecting from the Internet any of their servers that collect, store, or provide access to information that this software has gathered. The case is still in its preliminary stages.

In June 2002, a number of large Web publishers sued [[Claria]] for replacing advertisements, but settled out of court.\n\nCourts have not yet had to decide whether advertisers can be held [[Legal liability|liable]] for spyware that displays their ads. In many cases, the companies whose advertisements appear in spyware pop-ups do not directly do business with the spyware firm. Rather, they have contracted with an [[advertising agency]], which in turn contracts with an online subcontractor who gets paid by the number of \"impressions\" or appearances of the advertisement.

Lower Merion School District}}\nIn the 2010 [[Robbins v. Lower Merion School District|WebcamGate]] case, plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools secretly spied on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, and therefore infringed on their privacy rights.  The school loaded each student's computer with [[LANrev]]'s remote activation tracking software.  This included the now-discontinued \"TheftTrack\".  While TheftTrack was not enabled by default on the software, the program allowed the school district to elect to activate it, and to choose which of the TheftTrack surveillance options the school wanted to enable.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\nTheftTrack allowed school district employees to secretly remotely activate the webcam embedded in the student's laptop, above the laptop's screen. That allowed school officials to secretly take photos through the webcam, of whatever was in front of it and in its line of sight, and send the photos to the school's server.  The LANrev software disabled the webcams for all other uses (''e.g.'', students were unable to use [[Photo Booth]] or [[video chat]]), so most students mistakenly believed their webcams did not work at all.  In addition to webcam surveillance, TheftTrack allowed school officials to take screenshots, and send them to the school's server. In addition, LANrev allowed school officials to take snapshots of instant messages, web browsing, music playlists, and written compositions.  The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and [[screenshot]]s, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">[http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf \"Initial LANrev System Findings\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100827/http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services \u2013 prepared for [[Ballard Spahr]] (LMSD's counsel), May 2010.
