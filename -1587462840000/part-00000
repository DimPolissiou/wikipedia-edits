One can work in either of the three categories of manifolds: differentiable (smooth), PL, topological. Another possibility is to work with the decorations <math>s</math> or <math>h</math>.\n\n==The entries==\n\n===Normal invariants===\n{{main|Normal invariants}}\n\nA degree one normal map <math>(f,b) \\colon M \\to X</math> consists of the following data: an <math>n</math>-dimensional oriented closed manifold <math>M</math>, a map <math>f</math> which is of degree one (that means <math>f_* ([M]) = [X]</math>), and a bundle map <math>b \\colon TM \\oplus \\varepsilon^k \\to \\xi</math> from the stable tangent bundle of <math>M</math> to some bundle <math>\\xi</math> over <math>X</math>. Two such maps are equivalent if there exists a normal bordism between them (that means a bordism of the sources covered by suitable bundle data). The equivalence classes of degree one normal maps are called '''normal invariants'''.\n\nWhen defined like this the normal invariants <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> are just a pointed set, with the base point given by <math>(id,id)</math>. However the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction#Framed cobordism|Pontrjagin-Thom]] construction gives <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> a structure of an abelian group. In fact we have a non-natural bijection\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\cong [X,G/O]</math>\n\nwhere <math>G/O</math> denotes the homotopy fiber of the map <math>J \\colon BO \\to BG</math>, which is an infinite loop space and hence maps into it define a generalized cohomology theory. There are corresponding identifications of the normal invariants with <math>[X,G/PL]</math> when working with PL-manifolds and with <math>[X,G/TOP]</math> when working with topological manifolds.\n\n===L-groups===\n{{main|L-theory}}\n\nThe <math>L</math>-groups are defined algebraically in terms of [[quadratic forms]] or in terms of chain complexes with quadratic structure. See the main article for more details. Here only the properties of the L-groups described below will be important.\n\n===Surgery obstruction maps===\n{{main|Surgery obstruction}}\n\nThe map <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\to L_n (\\pi_1 (X))</math> is in the first instance a set-theoretic map (that means not necessarily a homomorphism) with the following property (when <math>n \\geq 5</math>:\n\nA degree one normal map <math>(f,b) \\colon M \\to X</math> is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence if and only if the image <math>\\theta (f,b)=0</math> in <math>L_n (\\mathbb{Z} [\\pi_1 (X)])</math>.\n\n===The normal invariants arrow <math>\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}(X) \\to \\mathcal{N} (X)</math>===\n\nAny homotopy equivalence <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> defines a degree one normal map.\n\n===The surgery obstruction arrow <math>\\partial \\colon L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X)) \\to \\mathcal{S}(X)</math>===\n\nThis arrow describes in fact an action of the group <math>L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> on the set <math>\\mathcal{S}(X)</math> rather than just a map. The definition is based on the realization theorem for the elements of the <math>L</math>-groups which reads as follows:\n\nLet <math>M</math> be an <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold with <math>\\pi_1 (M) \\cong \\pi_1 (X)</math> and let <math>x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>. Then there exists a degree one normal map of manifolds with boundary\n\n: <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (M \\times I, M \\times 0, M \\times 1)</math>\n\nwith the following properties:\n\n1. <math>\\theta (F,B) = x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>\n\n2. <math>F_0 \\colon M \\to M \\times 0</math> is a diffeomorphism\n\n3. <math>F_1 \\colon M' \\to M \\times 1</math> is a homotopy equivalence of closed manifolds\n\nLet <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> represent an element in <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> and let <math>x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>. Then <math>\\partial (f,x)</math> is defined as <math>f \\circ F_1 \\colon M' \\to X</math>.\n\n==The exactness==\n\nRecall that the surgery structure set is only a pointed set and that the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta</math> might not be a homomorphism. Hence it is necessary to explain what is meant when talking about the \"exact sequence\". So the surgery exact sequence is an exact sequence in the following sense:\n\nFor a normal invariant <math>z \\in \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> we have <math>z \\in  \\mathrm{Im} (\\eta)</math> if and only if <math>\\theta (z) = 0</math>. For two manifold structures <math>x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathcal{S} (X)</math> we have <math>\\eta (x_1) = \\eta(x_2)</math> if and only if there exists <math>u \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> such that <math>\\partial (u,x_1) = x_2</math>. For an element <math>u \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> we have <math>\\partial (u,\\mathrm{id}) = \\mathrm{id}</math> if and only if <math>u \\in \\mathrm{Im} (\\theta)</math>.\n\n==Versions revisited==\n\nIn the topological category the surgery obstruction map can be made into a homomorphism. This is achieved by putting an alternative abelian group structure on the normal invariants as described [[Normal invariants|here]]. Moreover, the surgery exact sequence can be identified with the algebraic surgery exact sequence of Ranicki which is an exact sequence of abelian groups by definition. This gives the structure set <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> the structure of an abelian group. Note, however, that there is to this date no satisfactory geometric description of this abelian group structure.\n\n==Classification of manifolds==\nThe answer to the organizing questions of the [[surgery theory]] can be formulated in terms of the surgery exact sequence. In both cases the answer is given in the form of a two-stage obstruction theory.\n\nThe existence question. Let <math>X</math> be a finite Poincar\u00e9 complex. It is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. Firstly, <math>X</math> must have a vector bundle reduction of its Spivak normal fibration. This condition can be also formulated as saying that the set of normal invariants <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> is non-empty. Secondly, there must be a normal invariant <math>x \\in \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> such that <math>\\theta (x) = 0</math>. Equivalently, the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta  \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\rightarrow L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> hits <math>0 \\in L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>.\n\nThe uniqueness question. Let <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> and <math>f' \\colon M' \\to X</math> represent two elements in the [[surgery structure set]] <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math>. The question whether they represent the same element can be answered in two stages as follows. First there must be a normal cobordism between the degree one normal maps induced by <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math>, this means <math>\\mathcal{} \\eta (f) = \\eta (f')</math> in <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math>. Denote the normal cobordism <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (X \\times I, X \\times 0, X \\times 1)</math>. If the surgery obstruction <math>\\mathcal{} \\theta (F,B)</math> in <math>\\mathcal{} L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> to make this normal cobordism to an [[h-cobordism]] (or [[s-cobordism]]) relative to the boundary vanishes then <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math> in fact represent the same element in the [[surgery structure set]].\n\n==Quinn's surgery fibration==\nIn his thesis written under the guidance of [[William Browder (mathematician)|Browder]], [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]] introduced a fiber sequence so that the surgery long exact sequence is the induced sequence on homotopy groups. {{Citation | last1=Quinn | first1=Frank | title=A geomeric formulation of surgery | publisher=Topology of Manifolds, Proc. Univ. Georgia 1969, 500-511 (1971)| year=1971|url=https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/quinngeo.pdf}}\n\n==Examples==\n\n===1. [[Homotopy sphere]]s===\n\nThis is an example in the smooth category, <math>n \\geq 5</math>.\n\nThe idea of the surgery exact sequence is implicitly present already in the original article of Kervaire and Milnor on the groups of homotopy spheres. In the present terminology we have\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Theta^n</math>\n\n<math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Omega^{alm}_n</math> the cobordism group of almost framed <math>n</math> manifolds, <math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) = \\Omega^{alm}_{n+1}</math>\n\n<math>L_n (1) =\\mathbb{Z}, 0, \\mathbb{Z}_2, 0</math> where <math>n \\equiv 0,1,2,3</math> mod <math>4</math> (recall the <math>4</math>-periodicity of the [[L-theory|L-groups]])\n\nThe surgery exact sequence in this case is an exact sequence of abelian groups. In addition to the above identifications we have\n\n<math>bP^{n+1} = \\mathrm{ker} (\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n)) = \\mathrm{coker} (\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) \\to L_{n+1} (1))</math>\n\nBecause the odd-dimensional L-groups are trivial one obtains these exact sequences:\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to bP^{4i} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i-2} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i-2} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to bP^{4i-2} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to bP^{2j} \\to \\Theta^{2j-1} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{2j-1} \\to 0</math>\n\nThe results of Kervaire and Milnor are obtained by studying the middle map in the first two sequences and by relating the groups <math>\\Omega_i^{alm}</math> to stable homotopy theory.\n\n===2. Topological spheres===\n\nThe [[generalized Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] in dimension <math>n</math> can be phrased as saying that <math>\\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (S^n) = 0</math>. It has been proved for any <math>n</math> by the work of Smale, Freedman and Perelman. From the surgery exact sequence for <math>S^n</math> for <math>n \\geq 5</math> in the topological category we see that\n\n: <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (S^n) \\to L_n (1)</math>\n\nis an isomorphism. (In fact this can be extended to <math>n \\geq 1</math> by some ad-hoc methods.)\n\n===3. Complex [[projective space]]s in the topological category===\n\nThe complex projective space <math>\\mathbb{C} P^n</math> is a <math>(2n)</math>-dimensional topological manifold with <math>\\pi_1 (\\mathbb{C} P^n)=1</math>. In addition it is known that in the case <math>\\pi_1 (X) =1</math> in the topological category the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta</math> is always surjective. Hence we have\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to L_{2n}(1) \\to 0</math>\n\nFrom the work of Sullivan one can calculate\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math> and hence <math>\\mathcal{S} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>\n\n===4. [[Aspherical space|Aspherical]] manifolds in the topological category===\n\nAn aspherical <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>X</math> is an <math>n</math>-manifold such that <math>\\pi_i (X) = 0</math> for <math>i \\geq 2</math>. Hence the only non-trivial homotopy group is <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math>\n\nOne way to state the [[Borel conjecture]] is to say that for such <math>X</math> we have that the [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]] <math>Wh (\\pi_1 (X))</math> is trivial and that\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S} (X) = 0</math>\n\nThis conjecture was proven in many special cases - for example when <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math> is <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>, when it is the fundamental group of a negatively curved manifold or when it is a word-hyperbolic group or a CAT(0)-group.\n\nThe statement is equivalent to showing that the surgery obstruction map to the right of the surgery structure set is injective and the surgery obstruction map to the left of the surgery structure set is surjective. Most of the proofs of the above-mentioned results are done by studying these maps or by studying the [[assembly map]]s with which they can be identified.

It is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. Firstly, <math>X</math> must have a vector bundle reduction of its Spivak normal fibration. This condition can be also formulated as saying that the set of normal invariants <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> is non-empty. Secondly, there must be a normal invariant <math>x \\in \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> such that <math>\\theta (x) = 0</math>. Equivalently, the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta  \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\rightarrow L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> hits <math>0 \\in L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>.\n\nThe uniqueness question. Let <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> and <math>f' \\colon M' \\to X</math> represent two elements in the [[surgery structure set]] <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math>. The question whether they represent the same element can be answered in two stages as follows. First there must be a normal cobordism between the degree one normal maps induced by <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math>, this means <math>\\mathcal{} \\eta (f) = \\eta (f')</math> in <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math>. Denote the normal cobordism <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (X \\times I, X \\times 0, X \\times 1)</math>. If the surgery obstruction <math>\\mathcal{} \\theta (F,B)</math> in <math>\\mathcal{} L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> to make this normal cobordism to an [[h-cobordism]] (or [[s-cobordism]]) relative to the boundary vanishes then <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math> in fact represent the same element in the [[surgery structure set]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===1. [[Homotopy sphere]]s===\n\nThis is an example in the smooth category, <math>n \\geq 5</math>.\n\nThe idea of the surgery exact sequence is implicitly present already in the original article of Kervaire and Milnor on the groups of homotopy spheres. In the present terminology we have\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Theta^n</math>\n\n<math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Omega^{alm}_n</math> the cobordism group of almost framed <math>n</math> manifolds, <math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) = \\Omega^{alm}_{n+1}</math>\n\n<math>L_n (1) =\\mathbb{Z}, 0, \\mathbb{Z}_2, 0</math> where <math>n \\equiv 0,1,2,3</math> mod <math>4</math> (recall the <math>4</math>-periodicity of the [[L-theory|L-groups]])\n\nThe surgery exact sequence in this case is an exact sequence of abelian groups. In addition to the above identifications we have\n\n<math>bP^{n+1} = \\mathrm{ker} (\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n)) = \\mathrm{coker} (\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) \\to L_{n+1} (1))</math>\n\nBecause the odd-dimensional L-groups are trivial one obtains these exact sequences:\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to bP^{4i} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i-2} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i-2} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to bP^{4i-2} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to bP^{2j} \\to \\Theta^{2j-1} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{2j-1} \\to 0</math>\n\nThe results of Kervaire and Milnor are obtained by studying the middle map in the first two sequences and by relating the groups <math>\\Omega_i^{alm}</math> to stable homotopy theory.\n\n===2. Topological spheres===\n\nThe [[generalized Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] in dimension <math>n</math> can be phrased as saying that <math>\\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (S^n) = 0</math>. It has been proved for any <math>n</math> by the work of Smale, Freedman and Perelman. From the surgery exact sequence for <math>S^n</math> for <math>n \\geq 5</math> in the topological category we see that\n\n: <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (S^n) \\to L_n (1)</math>\n\nis an isomorphism. (In fact this can be extended to <math>n \\geq 1</math> by some ad-hoc methods.)\n\n===3. Complex [[projective space]]s in the topological category===\n\nThe complex projective space <math>\\mathbb{C} P^n</math> is a <math>(2n)</math>-dimensional topological manifold with <math>\\pi_1 (\\mathbb{C} P^n)=1</math>. In addition it is known that in the case <math>\\pi_1 (X) =1</math> in the topological category the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta</math> is always surjective. Hence we have\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to L_{2n}(1) \\to 0</math>\n\nFrom the work of Sullivan one can calculate\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math> and hence <math>\\mathcal{S} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>\n\n===4. [[Aspherical space|Aspherical]] manifolds in the topological category===\n\nAn aspherical <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>X</math> is an <math>n</math>-manifold such that <math>\\pi_i (X) = 0</math> for <math>i \\geq 2</math>. Hence the only non-trivial homotopy group is <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math>\n\nOne way to state the [[Borel conjecture]] is to say that for such <math>X</math> we have that the [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]] <math>Wh (\\pi_1 (X))</math> is trivial and that\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S} (X) = 0</math>\n\nThis conjecture was proven in many special cases - for example when <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math> is <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>, when it is the fundamental group of a negatively curved manifold or when it is a word-hyperbolic group or a CAT(0)-group.\n\nThe statement is equivalent to showing that the surgery obstruction map to the right of the surgery structure set is injective and the surgery obstruction map to the left of the surgery structure set is surjective. Most of the proofs of the above-mentioned results are done by studying these maps or by studying the [[assembly map]]s with which they can be identified. See more details in [[Borel conjecture]], [[Farrell-Jones Conjecture]].\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Browder | first1=William | title=Surgery on simply-connected manifolds | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York |mr=0358813 | year=1972}}\n*{{Citation | last1=L\u00fcck | first1=Wolfgang | title=A basic introduction to surgery theory | url=http://131.220.77.52/lueck/data/ictp.pdf  | publisher= ICTP Lecture Notes Series 9, Band 1, of the school \"High-dimensional manifold theory\" in Trieste, May/June 2001, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste 1-224 | year=2002}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ranicki | first1=Andrew | title =  Algebraic L-theory and topological manifolds | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series = Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics | url = http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/books/topman.pdf  | year = 1992| volume=102 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ranicki | first1=Andrew | title=Algebraic and Geometric Surgery | url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/books/surgery.pdf  | publisher=Oxford Mathematical Monographs, Clarendon Press | isbn=978-0-19-850924-0 |mr=2061749 | year=2002}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wall | first1=C.

Its promoter was Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham's son.  Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham Castellanos Coronado, who was a professor, writer, and philosopher, helped to develop the cultural values of this culture.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==Economic Activity==\nAsunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n has two principal economic sectors - Agriculture forms part of one of these sectors. With the corn, bean and wheat harvest, agriculture is practiced at a family level. The other principal sector is ranching. Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n is a municipality that forms part of the bovine ranching production. In terms of commerce, Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n trades crafts. It also has grocery stores, drugstores, furniture stores and hardware stores. The facilities that Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n offers are: hotel service, guest house and motels. According to [[INEGI]] in 2000, the active economic population of this municipality is 5,037 persons, but only 5,022 have a job. Of these people, the primary sector (agriculture, ranching, fishing and hunting) has 27%. The secondary sector forms part with a 25% and the third sector (commerce, tourism and services) is leading the economic activity with 48% of the active population.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2016 conflict in Nochixtl\u00e1n]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nochixtl\u00e1n District, Oaxaca}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asuncion Nochixtlan}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:909 establishments]]\n[[Category:10th-century establishments in North America]]\n", "name_user": "Mikeyjbax", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n_Nochixtl%C3%A1n"}

Tokai is part of the Cape Peninsula centre of endemism of the [[Cape Floristic Region]].  With over 9000 species of plants the Cape Flora is by far the richest temperate flora on earth, earning itself the status of one of the 6 Floral Kingdoms on earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Floral Kingdoms |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1007|website=UNESCO|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Thus this tiny area has half of all the plant species in South Africa, and 20% of the flora of Africa. <ref name = \"CTBotanist\">{{cite web|title=Cape Town Botanist|url=http://www.capetownbotanist.com/pine-trees-protests-cape-flats-sand-fynbos/|website=Notes of a Cape Town Botanist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref><ref name = \"EndemicFactSheet\">{{cite web|title=Endemic Species Fact Sheet |url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_07_EndemicSpecies_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith over 2500 indigenous plant species the Peninsula is exceptionally rich even by Cape Floral standards.  By comparison, the United Kingdom has 1200 species of plants, the Kruger National Park has about 1980 species and Namibia has 3960 species. Additionally there are very few cities on earth with 150 plant species threatened with extinction, let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders ([[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park [https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ (SANParks)], and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems. <ref>{{cite web|author=SANParks Report |url=https://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_table_mountain/planning_docs/final-plan-1-25.pdf |title=Tokai Manor Precinct Plan|date=2012 |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> <ref name = \"CTBotanist\"/> In other words, the area is large enough to maintain minimum viable populations of plant species, making it ecologically viable. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\">{{cite web |url= https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=56866|title= Position Statement: Tokai and Cecilia Plantations |date= 2016|website= www.sanparks.org |access-date=2019-05-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Geology of Tokai Park ==\nThree main geological types occur within Tokai Park.  The steeper slopes and cliffs of Constantiaberg are Peninsula Formation Sandstone of the Cape Supergroup, covered with plant communities belonging to Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.  The midslopes comprise  deep, fertile, loamy soils, derived from the older Cape Suite granites, which support Peninsula Granite Fynbos plant communities, but which have been converted elsewhere on the Peninsula to vineyards and leaf urban suburbs.  These granites also underlie the lower Tokai park, but these are covered by Tertiary sands.  These nutrient-poor, acidic sands reach thicknesses of tens of meters, and support the highly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos.  The upper edge of the sands expose silcrete/ferricrete deposits, which have been mined in the past.  <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/>\n\n== Vegetation of Tokai Park ==\n\nTokai Park has four national vegetation types present, including: [[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and some small patches of [[Afromontane]] Forest. Tokai Park is also the location of historical and cultural heritage, such as the [[Tokai Arboretum]]. <ref name = \"BertaThesis\"/>\n\n[[File:Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Cape Town endangered vegetation.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]\n\n===Cape Flats Sand Fynbos===\n[[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]] is the most threatened vegetation type at Tokai.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://studylib.net/doc/10392640/6.-cape-flats-sand-fynbos--cape-town%E2%80%99s-unique-biodiversit|website=Study Lib|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>  Only 11% of this veld type is left.  Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for this veld type.  The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern).  It thus qualifies nationally as [[Critically Endangered]], both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species.  The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it is due to the rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town.  Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of this veld type. The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of this veld type.  This is a dry region (rainfall 410&nbsp;mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of this veld type, with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for this veld type. There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site.<ref>{{cite web|title=IUCN|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/54723/0|website=IUCN Redlist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Peninsula Granite Fynbos - Chapmans Peak Cape Town.JPG|thumb|right|Peninsula Granite Fynbos on Chapmans Peak]]\n\n===Peninsula Granite Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], occurs at the base of the mountain.  It forms the roots and foundation for the sandstone, and benefits from the moisture caught by the sandstone ramparts.  It is a relatively fertile soil, and consequently the vineyards and most expensive real estate in the city occurs on what used to be Granite Fynbos.  Because of its high carrying capacity, this is where the large herds of game, predators, and baboons used to occur historically in the southern Peninsula.  Silver Tree groves, lush riverine corridors and fertile, well-watered soils are in especial short supply along the west coast, and Constantia was one of the first farms developed by Europeans.  About one-third remains, and much that does is poorly managed, because of safety and fire concerns.  Some 24 IUCN Red List species occur, and 9 species are endemic or near-endemic to the type.  It is now classified as Critically Endangered, with 43% remaining; and only 30% conserved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Granite Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_02_PenGraniteFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rebelo |display-authors=etal |first1=AG|title=The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland|date=2006|publisher=Strelitzia 19, South African Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria|isbn=978-1919976-21-1}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos - Cape Peninsula - South Africa2.jpg|thumb|right|Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]]\n\n===Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] occurs on the uppermost slopes of Constantiaberg and Vlakkenberg.  It is confined to the sandstone geology, which weathers to a coarse sand.  The soil is exceptionally poor in nutrients and the carrying capacity for supporting animals is very low.  Animals do occur, but at extremely low densities.  The most common vertebrates are sunbirds and sugarbirds, subsidized by nectar provided by plants.  But in terms of plants this veld type is extremely rich: based solely on the large number (64) of threatened species, this veld type is classified as Endangered. Some 140 species of plant are categorized as [[Endemism|endemic]] to this vegetation type \u2013 they occur nowhere else on earth.  This high richness can be explained by the topography (greater relief means more habitats), the proximity to the sea (which limits the variation in climate, so that species occur in narrower zones on the mountain, thus packing more communities and species into the same altitudinal range), and the long isolation of the Peninsula mountains from the other mountains (so that fewer species are shared with neighbouring mountains at Kogelberg, Hottentots Holland and Piketberg, resulting in more unique species).<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_03_PenSandFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref> This vegetation type is well conserved: 97% remains; with 90% conserved.\n\n[[File:Afrotemperate forest western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|right|Afrotemperate forest]]\n\n===Afrotemperate Forest===\nThe [[Afrotemperate]] Forest is by far the rarest vegetation type at Tokai, and belongs to the Forest Biome.  Afrotemperate Forest cannot cope with fire, consequently it is confined to a few fire-safe kloofs at Tokai, minute pockets compared to the larger expanses in Orangekloof and Kirstenbosch.  As forests go, Afrotemperate is the richest forest in temperate regions, however, its species richness pales into insignificance compared to Fynbos: barely 20 species of tree occur naturally in these forests.  Animals, mainly insects, abound in these forests and their species diversity is extraordinary given their area.

Upper Tokai Park is characterized by [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and [[Southern Afrotemperate Forest|Afromontane Forest]] and noted for its diversity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Callum Evans|url=https://africageographic.com/blog/the-surprising-diversity-of-tokai-forest/ |title=The surprising diversity of Tokai Forest |publisher=Africa Geographic |date=2016-08-22|accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/cape-argus/20161128/281745563993432 |title=Connecting People Through News |publisher=PressReader.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, most of Tokai Park was under plantation.

Tokai is part of the Cape Peninsula centre of endemism of the [[Cape Floristic Region]].  With over 9000 species of plants the Cape Flora is by far the richest temperate flora on earth, earning itself the status of one of the 6 Floral Kingdoms on earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Floral Kingdoms |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1007|website=UNESCO|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Thus this tiny area has half of all the plant species in South Africa, and 20% of the flora of Africa. <ref name = \"CTBotanist\">{{cite web|title=Cape Town Botanist|url=http://www.capetownbotanist.com/pine-trees-protests-cape-flats-sand-fynbos/|website=Notes of a Cape Town Botanist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref><ref name = \"EndemicFactSheet\">{{cite web|title=Endemic Species Fact Sheet |url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_07_EndemicSpecies_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith over 2500 indigenous plant species the Peninsula is exceptionally rich even by Cape Floral standards.  By comparison, the United Kingdom has 1200 species of plants, the Kruger National Park has about 1980 species and Namibia has 3960 species. Additionally there are very few cities on earth with 150 plant species threatened with extinction, let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders ([[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park [https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ (SANParks)], and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems. <ref>{{cite web|author=SANParks Report |url=https://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_table_mountain/planning_docs/final-plan-1-25.pdf |title=Tokai Manor Precinct Plan|date=2012 |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> <ref name = \"CTBotanist\"/> In other words, the area is large enough to maintain minimum viable populations of plant species, making it ecologically viable. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\">{{cite web |url= https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=56866|title= Position Statement: Tokai and Cecilia Plantations |date= 2016|website= www.sanparks.org |access-date=2019-05-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Geology of Tokai Park ==\nThree main geological types occur within Tokai Park.  The steeper slopes and cliffs of Constantiaberg are Peninsula Formation Sandstone of the Cape Supergroup, covered with plant communities belonging to Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.  The midslopes comprise  deep, fertile, loamy soils, derived from the older Cape Suite granites, which support Peninsula Granite Fynbos plant communities, but which have been converted elsewhere on the Peninsula to vineyards and leaf urban suburbs.  These granites also underlie the lower Tokai park, but these are covered by Tertiary sands.  These nutrient-poor, acidic sands reach thicknesses of tens of meters, and support the highly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos.  The upper edge of the sands expose silcrete/ferricrete deposits, which have been mined in the past.  <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/>\n\n== Vegetation of Tokai Park ==\n\nTokai Park has four national vegetation types present, including: [[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and some small patches of [[Afromontane]] Forest. Tokai Park is also the location of historical and cultural heritage, such as the [[Tokai Arboretum]]. <ref name = \"BertaThesis\"/>\n\n[[File:Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Cape Town endangered vegetation.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]\n\n===Cape Flats Sand Fynbos===\n[[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]] is the most threatened vegetation type at Tokai.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://studylib.net/doc/10392640/6.-cape-flats-sand-fynbos--cape-town%E2%80%99s-unique-biodiversit|website=Study Lib|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>  Only 11% of this veld type is left.  Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for this veld type.  The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern).  It thus qualifies nationally as [[Critically Endangered]], both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species.  The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it is due to the rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town.  Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of this veld type. The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of this veld type.  This is a dry region (rainfall 410&nbsp;mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of this veld type, with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for this veld type. There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site.<ref>{{cite web|title=IUCN|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/54723/0|website=IUCN Redlist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Peninsula Granite Fynbos - Chapmans Peak Cape Town.JPG|thumb|right|Peninsula Granite Fynbos on Chapmans Peak]]\n\n===Peninsula Granite Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], occurs at the base of the mountain.  It forms the roots and foundation for the sandstone, and benefits from the moisture caught by the sandstone ramparts.  It is a relatively fertile soil, and consequently the vineyards and most expensive real estate in the city occurs on what used to be Granite Fynbos.  Because of its high carrying capacity, this is where the large herds of game, predators, and baboons used to occur historically in the southern Peninsula.  Silver Tree groves, lush riverine corridors and fertile, well-watered soils are in especial short supply along the west coast, and Constantia was one of the first farms developed by Europeans.  About one-third remains, and much that does is poorly managed, because of safety and fire concerns.  Some 24 IUCN Red List species occur, and 9 species are endemic or near-endemic to the type.  It is now classified as Critically Endangered, with 43% remaining; and only 30% conserved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Granite Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_02_PenGraniteFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rebelo |display-authors=etal |first1=AG|title=The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland|date=2006|publisher=Strelitzia 19, South African Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria|isbn=978-1919976-21-1}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos - Cape Peninsula - South Africa2.jpg|thumb|right|Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]]\n\n===Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] occurs on the uppermost slopes of Constantiaberg and Vlakkenberg.  It is confined to the sandstone geology, which weathers to a coarse sand.  The soil is exceptionally poor in nutrients and the carrying capacity for supporting animals is very low.  Animals do occur, but at extremely low densities.  The most common vertebrates are sunbirds and sugarbirds, subsidized by nectar provided by plants.  But in terms of plants this veld type is extremely rich: based solely on the large number (64) of threatened species, this veld type is classified as Endangered. Some 140 species of plant are categorized as [[Endemism|endemic]] to this vegetation type \u2013 they occur nowhere else on earth.  This high richness can be explained by the topography (greater relief means more habitats), the proximity to the sea (which limits the variation in climate, so that species occur in narrower zones on the mountain, thus packing more communities and species into the same altitudinal range), and the long isolation of the Peninsula mountains from the other mountains (so that fewer species are shared with neighbouring mountains at Kogelberg, Hottentots Holland and Piketberg, resulting in more unique species).<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_03_PenSandFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref> This vegetation type is well conserved: 97% remains; with 90% conserved.\n\n[[File:Afrotemperate forest western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|right|Afrotemperate forest]]\n\n===Afrotemperate Forest===\nThe [[Afrotemperate]] Forest is by far the rarest vegetation type at Tokai, and belongs to the Forest Biome.  Afrotemperate Forest cannot cope with fire, consequently it is confined to a few fire-safe kloofs at Tokai, minute pockets compared to the larger expanses in Orangekloof and Kirstenbosch.  As forests go, Afrotemperate is the richest forest in temperate regions, however, its species richness pales into insignificance compared to Fynbos: barely 20 species of tree occur naturally in these forests.  Animals, mainly insects, abound in these forests and their species diversity is extraordinary given their area.  There are only three small patches of Forest at Tokai, and their species have not been well documented. <ref name = \"PoulsenThesis\">{{cite thesis |type=MSc |last=Poulsen|first=Zoe C. |date=2013|title=Changes in distribution of indigenous forest in Table Mountain National Park from 1880-2012 |publisher=University of Cape Town |url=https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/6631}}</ref> Afrotemperate Forest is well conserved, with over 99% in good condition within the City of Cape Town. <ref>{{cite journal |last= Rebelo| display-authors=etal| date=2011|title= Impacts of urbanization in a biodiversity hotspot: Conservation challenges in Metropolitan Cape Town| journal= South African Journal of Botany| doi=10.1016/j.sajb.2010.04.0063| doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==  Restoration of Tokai Park ==\n\nParts of Tokai Park remain under pine plantation, but all plantations are due to be harvested by 2022, as they are a planted crop grown on a commercial basis by a private company, MTO Forestry.<ref name = \"Mostert\">{{cite book|last1=Mostert|first1=Elana|title=Identifying priority areas for active restoration after alien plant clearing|publisher=SUNScholar, Stellenbosch University|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/98857/mostert_identifying_2016.pdf?sequence=2}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_table_mountain/planning_docs/tokai-cecilia-mf-basei-info-2006.pdf|title= Baseline Information Report: Tokai/Cecilia Management Framework |date= 2006|website=www.tmnp.co.za/ |access-date=2019-05-10 }} </ref> <ref name = \"PositionStatement\"/> When all the plantations are removed, Tokai Park is to be restored, and combined with the greater Table Mountain National Park. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\"/>\n\nMost of the plantations at Tokai Park have been harvested to date, and the Fynbos restored either actively or passively. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\"/> Passive restoration involved a simple harvesting of plantations with no management nor prescribed burns to stimulate the Fynbos seedbanks. <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/> Consequently, these Fynbos sites have not recovered as well as those actively restored, and many alien shrubs and grasses are present. <ref name = \"Petersen\">{{cite journal |last= Petersen |display-authors=etal |date=2007|title=  Turning back the clock: Restoring the critically endangered vegetation type, Sand Fynbos, after three cycles of pine plantations in Tokai|journal= Veld & Flora |volume=93 |issue= 2|pages=102\u2013103 }}</ref> Subsequently, alien shrubs were systematically removed with pulling and cut stump treatment by management and a local Friends group. <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/> A few sites were actively restored using fire, with either hot or cool burns.
