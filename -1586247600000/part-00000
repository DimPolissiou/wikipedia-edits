It stars the voices of [[Will Arnett]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], and [[Aaron Paul]]. Set primarily in [[Los Angeles]], the series tells the story of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] horse named [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]] (Arnett), the washed-up star of a 1990s sitcom who plans his return to celebrity relevance with an autobiography to be written by ghostwriter [[Diane Nguyen]] (Brie). He also has to contend with his agent [[Princess Carolyn]] (Sedaris), roommate [[Todd Chavez]] (Paul), and former rival [[Mr. Peanutbutter]] (Tompkins). The show is designed by cartoonist [[Lisa Hanawalt]], who has been friends with Bob-Waksberg since high school and had previously worked with him on the [[webcomic]] ''Tip Me Over, Pour Me Out''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-origin-story-of-the-depressingly-good-bojack-horseman |title=The Origin Story of the Depressingly Good BoJack Horseman |last=Lambert |first=Molly |date=September 10, 2018 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=November 29, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130030535/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-origin-story-of-the-depressingly-good-bojack-horseman |archivedate=November 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmopmo.com/ |title=Tip Me Over Pour Me Out |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423005514/http://www.tmopmo.com/ |archivedate=April 23, 2008|url-status=dead |accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series premiered on [[Netflix]] on August 22, 2014, and ended on January 31, 2020, with a total of [[List of BoJack Horseman episodes|77 episodes]] over six seasons.

It was also nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program]].\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series is set in an [[alternate history|alternate world]] where humans and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals live side by side, taking place mostly in [[Hollywood]] (later known as \"{{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" after the \"D\" in the [[Hollywood Sign]] is stolen and destroyed). [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]] is the washed-up star of the 1990s sitcom ''Horsin' Around'', which told the story of a young bachelor horse trying to raise three human children who had been orphaned. Now living in relative obscurity in his [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, BoJack plans a big comeback to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography to be written by ghostwriter [[Diane Nguyen]]. At the same time, he deals with his addiction to drugs, alcohol, and the resulting recklessness. Bojack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and on-again-off-again girlfriend [[Princess Carolyn]], the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate [[Todd Chavez]], and his former rival [[Mr. Peanutbutter]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{Main|List of BoJack Horseman characters}}\n\n*[[Will Arnett]] as [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]], a self-loathing alcoholic horse currently in his 50s, whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful 1990s family sitcom called ''Horsin' Around''. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, desperate need for approval, and guilt over his own actions often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him.\n*[[Amy Sedaris]] as [[Princess Carolyn]], a pink [[Persian cat]] who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her tireless pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but suffers several miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina. She is a graduate of [[UCLA]].\n*[[Alison Brie]] as [[Diane Nguyen]], a human [[ghostwriter]], a well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a [[Vietnamese-American]] [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] from Boston. She is an idealist who wants to make the world a better place and expects others to behave to a higher standard, even though she often falls short of her own ideals. While writing BoJack's memoir, Diane and BoJack develop a strong friendship that initially becomes awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her, especially as she was dating Mr. Peanutbutter at the time. She eventually marries Mr. Peanutbutter, but during and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for [[Governor of California]], their marriage begins to deteriorate, and they divorce at the beginning of season 5. During the sixth season, Diane develops a relationship with a buffalo named Guy and comes to terms with her neglectful upbringing. She is a graduate of [[Boston University]].\n*[[Paul F. Tompkins]] as [[Mr. Peanutbutter]], an energetic and cheerful yellow [[Labrador Retriever]] who is BoJack's former sitcom rival. Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of ''Mr. Peanutbutter's House'', which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from ''Horsin' Around''. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on ''Horsin' Around''. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures. Mr. Peanutbutter has been married three times (including Katrina Peanutbutter, Jessica Biel and Diane Nguyen). In \"Old Acquaintance\", it is revealed that \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. During season 6, Mr. Peanutbutter spends much of his time alone. He obviously hates this, but he knows on some level that he needs to make peace on his own. He is a graduate of [[Northwestern University]] and a native of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]].\n*[[Aaron Paul]] as [[Todd Chavez]], an unemployed but well-meaning and friendly 24-year-old human [[slacker]] who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese, entrepreneurial know-how\u2014allying with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas\u2014and writing and composing his own [[rock opera]], which was eventually sabotaged by BoJack. This, along with other examples of BoJack's poor behavior towards him leads Todd to break ties with him. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case, switching places ''[[The Prince and the Pauper|Prince and the Pauper]]''\u2013style with a Cordovian dictator. He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In his teenage years, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. He realizes in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. In season 6, Todd forms a relationship with a rabbit named Maude who is also asexual.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of BoJack Horseman episodes}}\n{{:List of BoJack Horseman episodes}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nAfter moving to L.A. for the first time, writer [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]] unsuccessfully pitched ideas for shows to different networks. Among them was the idea for a family comedy set during the [[Reign of Terror]] called ''The Good Times Are Killing Me'', which Waksberg described as \"''[[All in the Family]]'' but in France, [...] where the Dad was [[guillotine]] salesman and business was booming, but he couldn't get his wacky family in order.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z42p3s-cueg|title=\u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 Oral History Part 1: Creating and Casting Bojack Plus Season 1\u2019s Surprise Turn|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Around the same time, he moved into a friend's house up in the [[Hollywood Hills]], living in what he described as \"a glorified closet in a beautiful mansion\". On his first night there, he \"look[ed] out on the deck over all of Hollywood, and [felt] simultaneously on top of the world and never more isolated and alone.\" This was the beginning of the idea that would become ''BoJack Horseman''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg and illustrator Lisa Hanawalt had met in high school and the two would often joke about creating an animated series together. The two eventually went their separate ways, with Bob-Waksberg moving to LA and Hanawalt moving to New York, but stayed in touch, working together on the web comic ''Tip Me Over, Pull Me Out''. In March 2010, Bob-Waksberg emailed Hanawalt asking for a drawing of one of the \"horse-guys\" she had been sketching, outlining a pitch for a show he titled \"BoJack the Depressed Talking Horse\". This early pitch hewed closely to the final product except for some minor differences - Todd was called Topher and was BoJack's childhood friend; Diane was a development executive instead of a [[ghostwriter]]; and Mr. Peanutbutter was BoJack's agent instead of Princess Carolyn, with his role as BoJack's rival instead filled by a horse called Honeybucket. Hanawalt joked that the concept sounded too depressing.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-oral-history.html|title=How ''BoJack Horseman'' Got Made: An oral history of TV's favorite alcoholic, narcissistic, self-destructive talking horse.|last=McDonnell|first=Chris|date=September 4, 2018|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225232/https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-oral-history.html|archivedate=November 29, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Development history ===\nIn late 2010, Bob-Waksberg met with producer Steven A. Cohen of [[the Tornante Company]] and pitched five different animated projects, including ''BoJack Horseman''. After the pitch, Cohen asked Bob-Waksberg which project interested him most, and Bob-Waksberg chose ''BoJack Horseman''. He wrote up a treatment for the series which was then pitched to the Tornante Company CEO [[Michael Eisner]], who suggested that the show center around a former racehorse rather than a former sitcom actor. While Bob-Waksberg successfully pushed for the show-business angle, this contributed to a storyline in which BoJack later played a racehorse in the fictional movie ''Secretariat'' in the show's second season.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nHanawalt was approached to come on board to design the show. She initially turned down the offer. \"I\u2019d just finished illustrating a children\u2019s book and it was kind of a bad experience. It took six months of work and felt endless, and I didn\u2019t want to commit to another big project. I made the mistake of not jumping aboard a good thing\". Production went ahead with various other artists coming on board to design the show and characters, but none captured Hanawalt's unique style. Six months later, Hanawalt was again approached to design the show, and this time agreed.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> She then worked with animation production studio [[ShadowMachine]] to develop the show's visual style.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> The production team put together a brief pilot presentation of the show which was used to shop the show to networks.\n\nBob-Waksberg and the team eventually pitched to [[Netflix]] in October 2013, and the show was picked up on the condition that the series launch in time for summer 2014.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> As a result, the 12-episode [[BoJack Horseman (season 1)|first season]] was produced in just 35 weeks; the first three episodes were written by Bob-Waksberg before a full writing staff were hired, and the first table read was held in the first week of production. The original plan had been to use the footage from the original pilot presentation in the season's first episode, however the decision was made to start from scratch (partially due to the decision to completely redesign the character of [[Todd Chavez]] from as he appeared in the pilot).<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> The series premiered on August 22, 2014.

Netflix asked Bob-Waksberg to leave some threads hanging to set up a potential second season, and Bob-Waksberg asked that, should ''Bojack Horseman'' get cancelled, Netflix warn him in advance so he could end the series properly. After the release of the fifth season, Netflix told Bob-Waksberg that the upcoming sixth season would be the show's last. \"They don\u2019t have to do that, obviously. But I said I would appreciate it if I could have the forewarning to give the show a proper finale, and not set up some cliffhangers that will never pay off. So when they picked up season six, they said, \u2018Hey, remember how you asked for that heads-up? We think that this is your heads-up.\u2019 So I'm very grateful that we got that notice.\u201d An extended [[BoJack Horseman (season 6)|sixth and final season]] of sixteen episodes was released in two parts of eight episodes each. The first half released on October 25, 2019, and the second on January 31, 2020.\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"I was presented with a seven-or-nine-page written spec treatment.

In Hollywood, in the industry, where animals and humans co-exist, and there\u2019s nothing weird about it. It\u2019s just how it is. And I read it and I thought it was just so smart.

Arnett and Paul also served as executive producers on the show. The character of BoJack was not written with any particular actor in mind. Bob-Waksberg cast Arnett because he was \"so funny, but there's also a darkness to him... I feel like, in his gravelly performance, you feel like he's lived a life. And there's a sadness lurking underneath there. But again, he's so funny... He took our dumbest stuff and spun it into gold.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Arnett also provided the role of BoJack's father, Butterscotch Horseman, as well as the voice of a younger BoJack in flashback sequences. Amy Sedaris signed on to the series as she wanted to work with Arnett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/09/73768/amy-sedaris-bojack-horseman-interview|title=Amy Sedaris' New Netflix Show Is Just Weird Enough For Her|last=Barrett|first=Colleen|website=www.refinery29.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Netflix' acquisition of the series, [[Paul F. Tompkins]] was cast as BoJack's sitcom rival [[Mr. Peanutbutter]]. When Bob-Waksberg was originally writing Mr. Peanutbutter, he originally imagined him as being a \"meat-head\" with a deep voice, but the casting of Arnett as BoJack and Paul as Todd caused the casting team to go in a different direction with the character. Tompkins brought a \"beautiful, lilting quality\" to the role, with Bob-Waksberg describing his performance as \"skipping above the line, which as a foil to BoJack is very funny. BoJack, even in his voice, is very sunk down and in the muck, whereas Mr. Peanutbutter is playfully skipping above the muck.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Alison Brie]] was cast as [[Diane Nguyen]], a [[ghostwriter]] hired to write BoJack's memoir and later ends up marrying Mr. Peanutbutter. As the show grew in popularity, Brie's casting as a Vietnamese-American character was met with controversy and accusations of [[Whitewashing in film|white-washing]]. Bob-Waksberg later commented on the controversy, applauding Brie's performance of the character while expressing regret and that he believed the casting had \"hurt the show\". \"When I think about casting now, I try to be very race-conscious. My casting director, Linda Lamontagne, and I are actively looking for people of color for every new character, and that\u2019s made a big difference in how we cast the show. I hope that is reflected even to a layperson observing the show. I\u2019m very proud of the movement we\u2019ve made, but we\u2019re always going to be somewhat hobbled in our efforts because of our original sin.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/bojack-horseman-raphael-bob-waksberg-diane-nguyen-representation.html|title=BoJack Horseman\u2019s Raphael Bob-Waksberg Says the Show Has Been \u201cHurt\u201d by Its All-White Cast|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2018-09-12|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\n== Influences ==\nCreator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has cited the cynical humor in the Canadian show ''[[The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)|The Newsroom]]'' as a large influence on ''BoJack Horseman''.

Despite mixed reviews upon its debut, critics were significantly more positive towards the second half of the first season, and the subsequent seasons received wide acclaim.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s01/|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 1 (2014)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028100017/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s01/|archivedate=October 28, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s02/|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 2 (2015)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028100040/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s02/|archivedate=October 28, 2016|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> [[Rolling Stone]] has called ''BoJack'' \"phenomenal\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/50-best-tv-shows-of-decade-2010s-914737/|title=50 Best TV Shows of the 2010s|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|last2=Fontoura|first2=Maria|date=2019-12-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> GQ magazine hailed the TV show as one of the best of the decade, declaring it to be ''\"...the benchmark by which all comedies of the decade can be judged''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-24-tv-shows-that-shaped-the-2010s|title=The 24 TV Shows That Shaped the 2010s|last=of\u00a0GQ|first=The Editors|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> [[IndieWire]] ranked ''BoJack Horseman'' as the greatest animated TV show of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-animated-series-all-time-cartoons-anime-tv-1202021835/|title=The 50 Best Animated Series Of All Time|last=Stone|first=Liz Shannon Miller,Ben Travers,Michael Schneider,Hanh Nguyen,Steve Greene,Jeff|last2=Miller|first2=Liz Shannon|date=2018-11-20|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07|last3=Travers|first3=Ben|last4=Schneider|first4=Michael|last5=Nguyen|first5=Hanh|last6=Greene|first6=Steve|last7=Stone|first7=Jeff}}</ref>\n\nThe show is lauded for its realistic take on dealing with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], addiction, [[self-destructive behavior]], racism, [[sexism]], sexuality, and the [[human condition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-bojack-horseman-depicts-depression-more-honestly-than-any-show-on-tv-80926|title=How 'Bojack Horseman' Depicts Depression More Honestly Than Any Show On Tv|author=Enlow|first=Courtney|date=September 8, 2017|website=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328031432/https://www.bustle.com/p/how-bojack-horseman-depicts-depression-more-honestly-than-any-show-on-tv-80926|archivedate=March 28, 2019|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe series received numerous accolades, including four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s for [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Animated Series|Best Animated Series]], three [[Annie Awards]] and two [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. It was also nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program]].\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series is set in an [[alternate history|alternate world]] where humans and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals live side by side, taking place mostly in [[Hollywood]] (later known as \"{{Not a typo|Hollywoo}}\" after the \"D\" in the [[Hollywood Sign]] is stolen and destroyed). [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]] is the washed-up star of the 1990s sitcom ''Horsin' Around'', which told the story of a young bachelor horse trying to raise three human children who had been orphaned. Now living in relative obscurity in his [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, BoJack plans a big comeback to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography to be written by ghostwriter [[Diane Nguyen]]. At the same time, he deals with his addiction to drugs, alcohol, and the resulting recklessness. Bojack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and on-again-off-again girlfriend [[Princess Carolyn]], the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate [[Todd Chavez]], and his former rival [[Mr. Peanutbutter]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{Main|List of BoJack Horseman characters}}\n\n*[[Will Arnett]] as [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]], a self-loathing alcoholic horse currently in his 50s, whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful 1990s family sitcom called ''Horsin' Around''. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards {{Not a typo|Hollywoo}} and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, desperate need for approval, and guilt over his own actions often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him.\n*[[Amy Sedaris]] as [[Princess Carolyn]], a pink [[Persian cat]] who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her tireless pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but suffers several miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina. She is a graduate of [[UCLA]].\n*[[Alison Brie]] as [[Diane Nguyen]], a human [[ghostwriter]], a well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a [[Vietnamese-American]] [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] from Boston. She is an idealist who wants to make the world a better place and expects others to behave to a higher standard, even though she often falls short of her own ideals. While writing BoJack's memoir, Diane and BoJack develop a strong friendship that initially becomes awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her, especially as she was dating Mr. Peanutbutter at the time. She eventually marries Mr. Peanutbutter, but during and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for [[Governor of California]], their marriage begins to deteriorate, and they divorce at the beginning of season 5. During the sixth season, Diane develops a relationship with a buffalo named Guy and comes to terms with her neglectful upbringing. She is a graduate of [[Boston University]].\n*[[Paul F. Tompkins]] as [[Mr. Peanutbutter]], an energetic and cheerful yellow [[Labrador Retriever]] who is BoJack's former sitcom rival. Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of ''Mr. Peanutbutter's House'', which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from ''Horsin' Around''. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on ''Horsin' Around''. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures. Mr. Peanutbutter has been married three times (including Katrina Peanutbutter, Jessica Biel and Diane Nguyen). In \"Old Acquaintance\", it is revealed that \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. During season 6, Mr. Peanutbutter spends much of his time alone. He obviously hates this, but he knows on some level that he needs to make peace on his own. He is a graduate of [[Northwestern University]] and a native of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]].\n*[[Aaron Paul]] as [[Todd Chavez]], an unemployed but well-meaning and friendly 24-year-old human [[slacker]] who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese, entrepreneurial know-how\u2014allying with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas\u2014and writing and composing his own [[rock opera]], which was eventually sabotaged by BoJack. This, along with other examples of BoJack's poor behavior towards him leads Todd to break ties with him. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case, switching places ''[[The Prince and the Pauper|Prince and the Pauper]]''\u2013style with a Cordovian dictator. He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In his teenage years, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. He realizes in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. In season 6, Todd forms a relationship with a rabbit named Maude who is also asexual.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of BoJack Horseman episodes}}\n{{:List of BoJack Horseman episodes}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nAfter moving to L.A. for the first time, writer [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]] unsuccessfully pitched ideas for shows to different networks. Among them was the idea for a family comedy set during the [[Reign of Terror]] called ''The Good Times Are Killing Me'', which Waksberg described as \"''[[All in the Family]]'' but in France, [...] where the Dad was [[guillotine]] salesman and business was booming, but he couldn't get his wacky family in order.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z42p3s-cueg|title=\u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 Oral History Part 1: Creating and Casting Bojack Plus Season 1\u2019s Surprise Turn|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Around the same time, he moved into a friend's house up in the [[Hollywood Hills]], living in what he described as \"a glorified closet in a beautiful mansion\". On his first night there, he \"look[ed] out on the deck over all of Hollywood, and [felt] simultaneously on top of the world and never more isolated and alone.\" This was the beginning of the idea that would become ''BoJack Horseman''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg and illustrator Lisa Hanawalt had met in high school and the two would often joke about creating an animated series together. The two eventually went their separate ways, with Bob-Waksberg moving to LA and Hanawalt moving to New York, but stayed in touch, working together on the web comic ''Tip Me Over, Pull Me Out''. In March 2010, Bob-Waksberg emailed Hanawalt asking for a drawing of one of the \"horse-guys\" she had been sketching, outlining a pitch for a show he titled \"BoJack the Depressed Talking Horse\". This early pitch hewed closely to the final product except for some minor differences - Todd was called Topher and was BoJack's childhood friend; Diane was a development executive instead of a [[ghostwriter]]; and Mr. Peanutbutter was BoJack's agent instead of Princess Carolyn, with his role as BoJack's rival instead filled by a horse called Honeybucket. Hanawalt joked that the concept sounded too depressing.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-oral-history.html|title=How ''BoJack Horseman'' Got Made: An oral history of TV's favorite alcoholic, narcissistic, self-destructive talking horse.|last=McDonnell|first=Chris|date=September 4, 2018|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225232/https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-oral-history.html|archivedate=November 29, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Development history ===\nIn late 2010, Bob-Waksberg met with producer Steven A. Cohen of [[the Tornante Company]] and pitched five different animated projects, including ''BoJack Horseman''. After the pitch, Cohen asked Bob-Waksberg which project interested him most, and Bob-Waksberg chose ''BoJack Horseman''. He wrote up a treatment for the series which was then pitched to the Tornante Company CEO [[Michael Eisner]], who suggested that the show center around a former racehorse rather than a former sitcom actor. While Bob-Waksberg successfully pushed for the show-business angle, this contributed to a storyline in which BoJack later played a racehorse in the fictional movie ''Secretariat'' in the show's second season.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nHanawalt was approached to come on board to design the show. She initially turned down the offer. \"I\u2019d just finished illustrating a children\u2019s book and it was kind of a bad experience. It took six months of work and felt endless, and I didn\u2019t want to commit to another big project. I made the mistake of not jumping aboard a good thing\". Production went ahead with various other artists coming on board to design the show and characters, but none captured Hanawalt's unique style. Six months later, Hanawalt was again approached to design the show, and this time agreed.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> She then worked with animation production studio [[ShadowMachine]] to develop the show's visual style.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> The production team put together a brief pilot presentation of the show which was used to shop the show to networks.\n\nBob-Waksberg and the team eventually pitched to [[Netflix]] in October 2013, and the show was picked up on the condition that the series launch in time for summer 2014.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> As a result, the 12-episode [[BoJack Horseman (season 1)|first season]] was produced in just 35 weeks; the first three episodes were written by Bob-Waksberg before a full writing staff were hired, and the first table read was held in the first week of production. The original plan had been to use the footage from the original pilot presentation in the season's first episode, however the decision was made to start from scratch (partially due to the decision to completely redesign the character of [[Todd Chavez]] from as he appeared in the pilot).<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> The series premiered on August 22, 2014.

Directors include [[Amy Winfrey]], J.C. Gonzalez, [[Mike Hollingsworth (animator)|Mike Hollingsworth]], [[Aaron Long (animator)|Aaron Long]] and Anne Walker Farrell.\n\nThe show's first season intentionally told a self-contained story in case the show was not picked up for a second season. Netflix asked Bob-Waksberg to leave some threads hanging to set up a potential second season, and Bob-Waksberg asked that, should ''Bojack Horseman'' get cancelled, Netflix warn him in advance so he could end the series properly. After the release of the fifth season, Netflix told Bob-Waksberg that the upcoming sixth season would be the show's last. \"They don\u2019t have to do that, obviously. But I said I would appreciate it if I could have the forewarning to give the show a proper finale, and not set up some cliffhangers that will never pay off. So when they picked up season six, they said, \u2018Hey, remember how you asked for that heads-up? We think that this is your heads-up.\u2019 So I'm very grateful that we got that notice.\u201d An extended [[BoJack Horseman (season 6)|sixth and final season]] of sixteen episodes was released in two parts of eight episodes each.

Arnett and Paul also served as executive producers on the show. The character of BoJack was not written with any particular actor in mind. Bob-Waksberg cast Arnett because he was \"so funny, but there's also a darkness to him... I feel like, in his gravelly performance, you feel like he's lived a life. And there's a sadness lurking underneath there. But again, he's so funny... He took our dumbest stuff and spun it into gold.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Arnett also provided the role of BoJack's father, Butterscotch Horseman, as well as the voice of a younger BoJack in flashback sequences. Amy Sedaris signed on to the series as she wanted to work with Arnett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/09/73768/amy-sedaris-bojack-horseman-interview|title=Amy Sedaris' New Netflix Show Is Just Weird Enough For Her|last=Barrett|first=Colleen|website=www.refinery29.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Netflix' acquisition of the series, [[Paul F. Tompkins]] was cast as BoJack's sitcom rival [[Mr. Peanutbutter]]. When Bob-Waksberg was originally writing Mr. Peanutbutter, he originally imagined him as being a \"meat-head\" with a deep voice, but the casting of Arnett as BoJack and Paul as Todd caused the casting team to go in a different direction with the character. Tompkins brought a \"beautiful, lilting quality\" to the role, with Bob-Waksberg describing his performance as \"skipping above the line, which as a foil to BoJack is very funny. BoJack, even in his voice, is very sunk down and in the muck, whereas Mr. Peanutbutter is playfully skipping above the muck.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Alison Brie]] was cast as [[Diane Nguyen]], a [[ghostwriter]] hired to write BoJack's memoir and later ends up marrying Mr. Peanutbutter. As the show grew in popularity, Brie's casting as a Vietnamese-American character was met with controversy and accusations of [[Whitewashing in film|white-washing]]. Bob-Waksberg later commented on the controversy, applauding Brie's performance of the character while expressing regret and that he believed the casting had \"hurt the show\". \"When I think about casting now, I try to be very race-conscious. My casting director, Linda Lamontagne, and I are actively looking for people of color for every new character, and that\u2019s made a big difference in how we cast the show. I hope that is reflected even to a layperson observing the show. I\u2019m very proud of the movement we\u2019ve made, but we\u2019re always going to be somewhat hobbled in our efforts because of our original sin.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/bojack-horseman-raphael-bob-waksberg-diane-nguyen-representation.html|title=BoJack Horseman\u2019s Raphael Bob-Waksberg Says the Show Has Been \u201cHurt\u201d by Its All-White Cast|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2018-09-12|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\n== Influences ==\nCreator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has cited the cynical humor in the Canadian show ''[[The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)|The Newsroom]]'' as a large influence on ''BoJack Horseman''.

Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}}]]\n\n'''Ngang tone:'''\n\n*The ''ngang'' tone is level at around the mid level (33) and is produced with [[modal voice]] [[phonation]] (i.e. with \"normal\" phonation). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utternce. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

One analysis, that of {{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} has them as being phonemes {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}, where {{IPA|/c/}} contrasts with both syllable-final ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}} and ''c'' {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} contrasts with syllable-final ''n'' {{IPA|/n/}} and ''ng'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}}. Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. This results in a three-way contrast between the rimes ''\u0103n'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308n]}} vs. ''anh'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308\u0272]}} vs. ''\u0103ng'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308\u014b]}}. For this reason, a separate phonemic {{IPA|/\u0272/}} is posited.\n\n====Table of Hanoi finals====\nThe following [[syllable rime|rime]]s ending with [[velar consonant]]s have been [[diphthong]]ized in the Hanoi dialect:<ref name=\"rhyme\">{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2006}}</ref>\n\n:{| cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"line-height: 1.0em;\"\n| ''ong'', ''oc''\n| {{IPA|/\u0254\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254k/}}\n| \u2192\n| {{IPA|[\u0103w\u014b\u0361m]}}, {{IPA|[\u0103wk\u0361p\u031a]}}\n|-\n| ''\u00f4ng'', ''\u00f4c''\n| {{IPA|/o\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/ok/}}\n| \u2192\n| {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306w\u014b\u0361m]}}, {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306wk\u0361p\u031a]}}\n|-\n| ''anh'', ''ach''\n| {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/\u025bk/}}\n| \u2192\n| {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}, {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}\n|-\n| ''\u00eanh'', ''\u00each''\n| {{IPA|/e\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/ek/}}\n| \u2192\n| {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}, {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}\n|}\n\nWith the above phonemic analyses, the following is a table of rimes ending in {{IPA|/n, t, \u014b, k/}} in the Hanoi dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n! {{IPA|/\u0103/}}\n! {{IPA|/a/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u0254/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u0259\u0306/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u0259/}}\n! {{IPA|/e/}}\n! {{IPA|/o/}}\n! {{IPA|/i/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u0268/}}\n! {{IPA|/u/}}\n! {{IPA|/i\u0259\u032f/}}\n! {{IPA|/\u0268\u0259\u032f/}}\n! {{IPA|/u\u0259\u032f/}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|/n/}}\n| ''\u0103n''\n| ''an''\n| ''en''\n| ''on''\n| ''\u00e2n''\n| ''\u01a1n''\n| ''\u00ean''\n| ''\u00f4n''\n| ''in''\n| ''\u01b0n''\n| ''un''\n| ''i\u00ean''\n| ''\u01b0\u01a1n''\n| ''u\u00f4n''\n|-\n! {{IPA|/t/}}\n| ''\u0103t''\n| ''at''\n| ''et''\n| ''ot''\n| ''\u00e2t''\n| ''\u01a1t''\n| ''\u00eat''\n| ''\u00f4t''\n| ''it''\n| ''\u01b0t''\n| ''ut''\n| ''i\u00eat''\n| ''\u01b0\u01a1t''\n| ''u\u00f4t''\n|-\n! {{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n| ''\u0103ng''\n| ''ang''\n| ''anh''\n| ''ong''\n| ''\u00e2ng''\n| \u2013\n| ''\u00eanh''\n| ''\u00f4ng''\n| ''inh''\n| ''\u01b0ng''\n| ''ung''\n| ''i\u00eang''\n| ''\u01b0\u01a1ng''\n| ''u\u00f4ng''\n|-\n! {{IPA|/k/}}\n| ''\u0103c''\n| ''ac''\n| ''ach''\n| ''oc''\n| ''\u00e2c''\n| \u2013\n| ''\u00each''\n| ''\u00f4c''\n| ''ich''\n| ''\u01b0c''\n| ''uc''\n| ''i\u00eac''\n| ''\u01b0\u01a1c''\n| ''u\u00f4c''\n|}\n\n===Saigon finals===\n====Merger of finals====\nWhile the variety of Vietnamese spoken in Hanoi has preserved finals faithfully from Middle Vietnamese, the variety spoken in Saigon has drastically changed its finals.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utternce. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall. The other four are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbca.org/recognize/player-awards/naismith-starting-5 |title=Naismith Starting 5 |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Ann Meyers Drysdale Award|Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard Award]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller Award|Cheryl Miller Small Forward Award]]\n* [[Katrina McClain Award|Katrina McClain Power Forward Award]]\n* [[Lisa Leslie Award|Lisa Leslie Center Award]]\n\nThe voting body for the Lieberman Award also changed upon its incorporation into the Naismith Starting Five. Each of the Starting Five awards is now determined by a selection committee consisting of Hall of Famers, WBCA coaching members, and media, and headed by the award's namesake.

The announcement of the winner has coincided with the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] weekend, with an award ceremony the following Wednesday which was hosted by the Detroit Rotary Club at the [[Detroit Athletic Club]] through 2013.<ref name=\"The Award Selection Process\"/> Beginning with the 2014 award to Odyssey Sims of Baylor University, the Nancy Lieberman Award has been presented by the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Final Four proceedings, and is now presented at the annual convention of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA).\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season started a new era for the award. Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall.

The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half-century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the Indiana University and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.  He is buried in the family plot in Jamesport, Missouri.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76817470/aurand-harris</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJames Aurand Harris, the only child of Myrtle Sebastian and Dr. George Dowe Harris, was born on July 4, 1915, in Jamesport, Missouri. His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him.\n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"<ref>Biographical material is based on personal and telephone interviews with the author between 1985 and 1987 and earlier work by Coleman Jennings. \u201cThe Playwright and the Plays,\u201d Six Plays by Aurand Harris, ed. Coleman A.

In 1939, he obtained a Master of Arts from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he worked with [[Winifred Ward]], a pioneer in children's theatre.<ref name=\"coleman46\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 46 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref> Then he made postgraduate studies at Columbia University (1947). In 1991 he obtained his Doctor of Humane Letters (honorary) from the Indiana University. Thomas Ehrlich, the 15th President of the Indiana University, presented the honorary degree.<ref name=\"honorsandawards.iu.edu\">https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/search-awards/honoree.shtml?honoreeID=336</ref>\n \nHe commenced his teaching career in September 1939 at Horace Mann High School [[Gary, Indiana]], as a studio teacher for dramatics.  He taught there for two years. In September 1941, he served as the Head of the Drama Department at [[William Woods University|William Woods College]], in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. In 1946, he relocated to New York City to study writing for the theater. Simultaneously, he commenced a teaching position at Grace Episcopal Church School in [[Manhattan]]. He remained in this position for 33 years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nInitially, he was interested in adult theater, but after setbacks in that field, he turned his attention to writing for children, having already written several children's plays in his younger years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nAurand Harris's first play was ''Once Upon a Clothesline''. The first production of ''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was performed by the Campus Players of William Woods College, under the direction of the author, Aurand Harris.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\">https://juniortheatre.com/shows/once-upon-a-clothesline-1951/</ref>''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was a prize-winning play in the Second Annual Seattle Junior Programs Playwriting Contest. This production featured the intermediate group of sixth, seventh and eighth-grade students from the 1951 Seattle Summer Theatre Workshop, performing in the Recital Hall at the Palisades Building in Balboa Park. This play would later go on tour at playgrounds throughout the city.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\"/> Later, the play was performed on July 27\u201328, 1951, at the San Diego Junior Theater, directed by Signe Culbertson and assisted by James Sams.<ref>/juniortheatre.com/artists/aurand-harris/</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Aurand Harris wrote ''Androcles and the Lion'', his best-known work. His play educates the audience about ''commedia dell'arte'' while providing entertainment.  The play is funny and joyful, with an essential message about freedom and love. It was translated into ten languages and was, for a time, the most produced play of any American playwright for children. In 1976 he became the first children's playwright to receive a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship. In 1985 he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theater; the ceremony took place at the Kennedy Center in Washington. In 1988 he directed one of his plays at Shanghai Children's Art Theater. It was the first time a western children's play had been performed for Chinese children.<ref>Jennings, Coleman A.; Sendak, Maurice (2005). Theatre for Young Audiences. Macmillan. p. 47.

The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half-century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the Indiana University and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.  He is buried in the family plot in Jamesport, Missouri.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76817470/aurand-harris</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJames Aurand Harris, the only child of Myrtle Sebastian and Dr. George Dowe Harris, was born on July 4, 1915, in Jamesport, Missouri. His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him.\n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"<ref>Biographical material is based on personal and telephone interviews with the author between 1985 and 1987 and earlier work by Coleman Jennings. \u201cThe Playwright and the Plays,\u201d Six Plays by Aurand Harris, ed.

In 1939, he obtained a Master of Arts from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he worked with [[Winifred Ward]], a pioneer in children's theatre.<ref name=\"coleman46\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 46 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref> Then he made postgraduate studies at Columbia University (1947). In 1991 he obtained his Doctor of Humane Letters (honorary) from the Indiana University. Thomas Ehrlich, the 15th President of the Indiana University, presented the honorary degree.<ref name=\"honorsandawards.iu.edu\">https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/search-awards/honoree.shtml?honoreeID=336</ref>\n \nHe commenced his teaching career in September 1939 at Horace Mann High School [[Gary, Indiana]], as a studio teacher for dramatics.  He taught there for two years. In September 1941, he served as the Head of the Drama Department at [[William Woods University|William Woods College]], in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. In 1946, he relocated to New York City to study writing for the theater. Simultaneously, he commenced a teaching position at Grace Episcopal Church School in [[Manhattan]]. He remained in this position for 33 years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nInitially, he was interested in adult theater, but after setbacks in that field, he turned his attention to writing for children, having already written several children's plays in his younger years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nAurand Harris's first play was ''Once Upon a Clothesline''. The first production of ''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was performed by the Campus Players of William Woods College, under the direction of the author, Aurand Harris.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\">https://juniortheatre.com/shows/once-upon-a-clothesline-1951/</ref>''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was a prize-winning play in the Second Annual Seattle Junior Programs Playwriting Contest. This production featured the intermediate group of sixth, seventh and eighth-grade students from the 1951 Seattle Summer Theatre Workshop, performing in the Recital Hall at the Palisades Building in Balboa Park. This play would later go on tour at playgrounds throughout the city.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\"/> Later, the play was performed on July 27\u201328, 1951, at the San Diego Junior Theater, directed by Signe Culbertson and assisted by James Sams.<ref>/juniortheatre.com/artists/aurand-harris/</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Aurand Harris wrote ''Androcles and the Lion'', his best-known work. His play educates the audience about ''commedia dell'arte'' while providing entertainment.  The play is funny and joyful, with an essential message about freedom and love. It was translated into ten languages and was, for a time, the most produced play of any American playwright for children. In 1976 he became the first children's playwright to receive a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship. In 1985 he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theater; the ceremony took place at the Kennedy Center in Washington. In 1988 he directed one of his plays at Shanghai Children's Art Theater. It was the first time a western children's play had been performed for Chinese children.<ref>Coleman Jennings, ''Theatre for Young Audiences'', MacMillian, p. 47.</ref>\n\nHe also co-edited several anthologies of plays for children and adolescents.<ref name=\"coleman47\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 47 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref> They include ''Short Plays of Theatre Classics'', selected and edited by Aurand Harris.

The method is used in [[radiology]], [[archaeology]], [[biology]], [[atmospheric science]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[plasma physics]], [[materials science]], [[astrophysics]], [[quantum information]], and other areas of science. The word ''tomography'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ''tomos'', \"slice, section\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9 ''graph\u014d'', \"to write\" or, in this context as well, \" to describe.\" A device used in tomography is called a '''tomograph''', while the image produced is a '''tomogram'''.\n\nIn many cases, the production of these images is based on the mathematical procedure [[tomographic reconstruction]], such as [[CT scan|X-ray computed tomography]] technically being produced from multiple [[projectional radiograph]]s. Many different [[reconstruction algorithm]]s exist. Most algorithms fall into one of two categories: [[filtered back projection]] (FBP) and [[iterative reconstruction]] (IR). These procedures give inexact results: they represent a compromise between accuracy and computation time required. FBP demands fewer computational resources, while IR generally produces fewer artifacts (errors in the reconstruction) at a higher computing cost.<ref name=\"ref1\">Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection,  2nd edition, Springer, 2009</ref>\n\nAlthough [[MRI]] and [[ultrasound]] are transmission methods, they typically do not require movement of the transmitter to acquire data from different directions. In MRI, both projections and higher spatial harmonics are sampled by applying spatially-varying magnetic fields; no moving parts are necessary to generate an image. On the other hand, since ultrasound uses time-of-flight to spatially encode the received signal, it is not strictly a tomographic method and does not require multiple acquisitions at all.\n\n==Types of tomography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n !

By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on a\nclosed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.<ref>Banhart, John, ed. Advanced Tomographic Methods in Materials Research and Engineering.

A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired, for example, by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], or [[Microtomography|MicroCT]] [[Image scanner|scanner]]. These are usually acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern.\nThis is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\nTo render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a [[Virtual camera|camera]] in space relative to the volume.  Also, one needs to define the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] and color of every voxel.\nThis is usually defined using an [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] (for red, green, blue, alpha) [[transfer function]] that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.\n\nFor example, a volume may be viewed by extracting [[isosurface]]s (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data.  The [[marching cubes]] algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.\n\n==History==\n[[Focal plane tomography]] was developed in the 1930s by the radiologist [[Alessandro Vallebona]], and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in [[projectional radiography]]. In a 1953 article in the medical journal [[Chest (journal)|''Chest'']], B. Pollak of the [[Fort William Sanatorium]] described the use of planography, another term for tomography.<ref>{{cite journal\n |title      = Experiences with Planography\n |first      = B.\n |last       = Pollak\n |journal    = Chest\n |doi        = 10.1378/chest.24.6.663\n |pmid = 13107564\n |date       = December 1953\n |volume     = 24\n |issue      = 6\n |pages      = 663\u2013669\n |url        = http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/24/6/663.abstract\n |issn       = 0012-3692\n |accessdate = July 10, 2011\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly [[computed tomography]] the late-1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=J.T.|title=A History of the Radiological Sciences|publisher=[[American Roentgen Ray Society]]|chapter-url=http://www.arrs.org/publications/HRS/diagnosis/RCI_D_c15.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2014|chapter=Conventional Tomography}}</ref> Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appears sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred.

By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on a\nclosed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.<ref>Banhart, John, ed. Advanced Tomographic Methods in Materials Research and Engineering.

A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired, for example, by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], or [[Microtomography|MicroCT]] [[Image scanner|scanner]]. These are usually acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern.\nThis is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\nTo render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a [[Virtual camera|camera]] in space relative to the volume.  Also, one needs to define the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] and color of every voxel.\nThis is usually defined using an [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] (for red, green, blue, alpha) [[transfer function]] that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.\n\nFor example, a volume may be viewed by extracting [[isosurface]]s (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data.  The [[marching cubes]] algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.\n\n==History==\n[[Focal plane tomography]] was developed in the 1930s by the radiologist [[Alessandro Vallebona]], and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in [[projectional radiography]]. In a 1953 article in the medical journal [[Chest (journal)|''Chest'']], B. Pollak of the [[Fort William Sanatorium]] described the use of planography, another term for tomography.<ref>{{cite journal\n |title      = Experiences with Planography\n |first      = B.\n |last       = Pollak\n |journal    = Chest\n |doi        = 10.1378/chest.24.6.663\n |pmid = 13107564\n |date       = December 1953\n |volume     = 24\n |issue      = 6\n |pages      = 663\u2013669\n |url        = http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/24/6/663.abstract\n |issn       = 0012-3692\n |accessdate = July 10, 2011\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly [[computed tomography]] the late-1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=J.T.|title=A History of the Radiological Sciences|publisher=[[American Roentgen Ray Society]]|chapter-url=http://www.arrs.org/publications/HRS/diagnosis/RCI_D_c15.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2014|chapter=Conventional Tomography}}</ref> Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appears sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred. By moving an X-ray source and the film in opposite directions during the exposure, and modifying the direction and extent of the movement, operators can select different focal planes which contain the structures of interest.\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscatinline|Tomography}}\n* [[Chemical imaging]]\n* [[3D reconstruction]]\n* [[Discrete tomography]]\n* [[Geometric tomography]]\n* [[Geophysical imaging]]\n* [[Industrial CT scanning]]\n* [[Johann Radon]]\n* [[Medical imaging]]\n* [[MRI#MRI versus CT|MRI compared with CT]]\n* [[Network tomography]]\n* [[Nonogram]], a type of puzzle based on a discrete model of tomography\n* [[Radon transform]]\n* [[Tomographic reconstruction]]\n* [[Multiscale Tomography]]\n* [[Voxels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bronnikov-algorithms.com/downloads/Andrei.Bronnikov_Image_reconstruction.pdf Image reconstruction algorithms for microtomography]\n\n{{Medical imaging}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Medical imaging]]\n[[Category:Tomography| ]]\n", "name_user": "A loose necktie", "label": "safe", "comment": "bolds", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"}
