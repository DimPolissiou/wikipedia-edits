{"title_page": "Laser Doppler vibrometer", "text_new": "[[File:LDV Schematic.png|thumb|300 px|Basic components of a laser Doppler vibrometer]]\nA '''laser Doppler vibrometer''' ('''LDV''') is a scientific instrument that is used to make non-contact [[vibration]] measurements of a surface. The [[laser]] beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] shift of the reflected laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface. The output of an LDV is generally a continuous analog voltage that is directly proportional to the target velocity component along the direction of the laser beam.\n\nSome advantages of an LDV over similar measurement devices such as an [[accelerometer]] are that the LDV can be directed at targets that are difficult to access, or that may be too small or too hot to attach a physical [[transducer]]. Also, the LDV makes the vibration measurement without mass-loading the target, which is especially important for [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] devices.\n\n==Principles of operation==\nA vibrometer is generally a two beam laser [[interferometer]] that measures the frequency (or phase) difference between an internal reference beam and a test beam. The most common type of laser in an LDV is the [[helium\u2013neon laser]], although [[laser diodes]], [[fiber laser]]s, and [[Nd:YAG laser]]s are also used. The test beam is directed to the target, and scattered light from the target is collected and interfered with the reference beam on a [[photodetector]], typically a [[photodiode]]. Most commercial vibrometers work in a [[Optical heterodyne detection|heterodyne]] regime by adding a known frequency shift (typically 30\u201340&nbsp;MHz) to one of the beams. This frequency shift is usually generated by a [[Bragg Cell|Bragg cell]], or acousto-optic modulator.<ref name=\"LutzmannGoehler2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Lutzmann|first1=Peter|last2=G\u00f6hler|first2=Benjamin|last3=Hill|first3=Chris A.|last4=Putten|first4=Frank van|title=Laser vibration sensing at Fraunhofer IOSB: review and applications|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=56|issue=3|year=2016|pages=031215|issn=0091-3286|doi=10.1117/1.OE.56.3.031215|bibcode=2017OptEn..56c1215L}}</ref>\n\nA schematic of a typical laser vibrometer is shown above. The beam from the laser, which has a frequency f<sub>o</sub>, is divided into a reference beam and a test beam with a [[beamsplitter]]. The test beam then passes through the Bragg cell, which adds a frequency shift f<sub>b</sub>. This frequency shifted beam then is directed to the target. The motion of the target adds a Doppler shift to the beam given by f<sub>d</sub> = 2*v(t)*cos(\u03b1)/\u03bb, where v(t) is the velocity of the target as a function of time, \u03b1 is the angle between the laser beam and the velocity vector, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\nLight scatters from the target in all directions, but some portion of the light is collected by the LDV and reflected by the beamsplitter to the photodetector. This light has a frequency equal to f<sub>o</sub> + f<sub>b</sub> + f<sub>d</sub>. This scattered light is combined with the reference beam at the photo-detector. The initial frequency of the laser is very high (> 10<sup>14</sup> Hz), which is higher than the response of the detector. The detector does respond, however, to the [[beat (music)|beat]] frequency between the two beams, which is at f<sub>b</sub> + f<sub>d</sub> (typically in the tens of MHz range).\n\nThe output of the photodetector is a standard [[frequency modulated]] (FM) signal, with the Bragg cell frequency as the [[carrier frequency]], and the Doppler shift as the modulation frequency. This signal can be demodulated to derive the velocity vs. time of the vibrating target.\n\n==Applications==\nLDVs are used in a wide variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications.

{"title_page": "Coffee extraction", "text_new": "'''Coffee extraction''' is the process of [[solvation|dissolving]] soluble flavors from coffee grounds in water. Proper [[coffee preparation|brewing of coffee]] requires using the correct quantity of coffee, ground precisely, extracted to the correct degree, controlled by the correct time and correct temperature.\n\n== Concepts ==\nSpecialized vocabulary and guidelines exist to discuss coffee extraction, primarily various ''ratios,'' which are used to optimally brew coffee. The key concepts are:<ref>{{Harv|Lingle|1995}}</ref>\n;Extraction: Also known as \"solubles yield\" or \"Extraction Yield\" \u2013 what percentage (by weight) of the grounds are dissolved in the water. Put simply, how much of the coffee in the brewer ends up in the cup.\n;Extraction yield %: The percentage by mass of coffee grounds that ends up dissolved in the brewed coffee. Extraction yield % = Brewed Coffee[g]  x TDS[%] /Coffee Grounds[g] E.g. (espresso) 36g brewed coffee x 10% TDS / 18g ground coffee = Extraction yield of 20% \n;Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): TDS is expressed in parts per million (ppm).\n;Strength: Also known as \"solubles concentration\", as measured by [[Total Dissolved Solids]] \u2013 how concentrated or watery the coffee is. \n;Brew ratio: The ratio of coffee grounds (mass) to water (volume): how much coffee is used for a given quantity of water. This may be expressed in units of either grams per litre or ounces per US half gallon.\nThese are related as follows:\n:Strength = Brew ratio &times; Extraction\nwhich can be analyzed as the following [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]:\n:dissolved solids/water =  grounds/water &times; dissolved solids/grounds\nA subtler issue is ''which'' solubles are dissolved \u2013 this depends on solubility of different substances at different temperatures, changes over the course of extraction (different substances are extracted during the first 1% of extraction than in the period from 19% extraction to 20% extraction), and is primarily affected by ''temperature.''\n\n{{external media\n|image1=[http://www.mountaincity.com/images/SCAA_brew_chart.jpg SCAA brew chart] (American)<ref>[http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html Brewing -- the American Standard]</ref>\n|image2=[http://www.mountaincity.com/images/SCAE_brew_chart.png SCAE brew chart] (European)<ref>[http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-2.html Brewing -- the European Standard]</ref>\n|image3=[http://www.mountaincity.com/images/Norsk_brew_chart.png NCA brew chart] (Norwegian)<ref>[http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-3.html Brewing -- the Norwegian Coffee Association Standard]</ref>\n}}\nBrewing guidelines are summarized in ''Brewing Control Charts,'' which graph these elements, and center around an \"ideal\" rectangle indicating the target brewing range. The yield is the horizontal (''x''-axis), the strength is the vertical (''y''-axis), and a given brewing ratio determines a [[Vector (geometric)|radial]] line, since for a given brewing ratio the strength is [[directly proportional]] to the yield.\n\nIn brief, ideal yield is widely agreed to be 20%\u00b12% (18%\u201322%), while ideal strength (for brewed coffee) varies between 1.25%\u00b1.10% (1.15%\u20131.35%) in American standards, to 1.40%\u00b1.10% (1.30%\u20131.50%) in Norwegian standards, with European standards falling in the middle at 1.20%\u20131.45%). This is most easily achieved with a brewing ratio of 55 g/L (55 grams of coffee per 1 L of water) in American standards, to 63 g/L in Norwegian standards, yielding approximately 14\u201316 grams of coffee for a standard 240 ml (8&nbsp;oz) cup.\n\nThese guidelines apply regardless of brewing method, with the following exceptions:\nespresso is significantly different (much stronger, and more varied extraction), and dark roasts taste subjectively stronger than medium roasts (standards are based on medium roasts; equivalent strength requires using a lower brewing ratio for darker roasts).\n\nThese components are addressed in turn.\n\n== Extraction yield ==\nIdeal yield is widely agreed to be 20%\u00b12% (18%\u201322%). This was originally computed by the Coffee Brewing Institute, under the direction of Professor E. E. Lockhart at [[MIT]] in the 1950s, and has been verified by subsequent tests by the [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] (SCAA).\n\nYields of under 18% are \"under-extracted\", specifically \"under-developed\" \u2013 desirable components have not been sufficiently extracted \u2013 and \"unbalanced\", specifically ''sour,'' because acids are extracted early, while balancing sugars (sweetness) and bitter components are extracted later.<ref name=\"schulman\" />\n\nYields of over 22% are \"over-extracted\", specifically ''bitter,'' as bitter components continue to be extracted after acids and sugars have largely completed extraction. In certain situations, yields surpassing 22% can be absent of bitterness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baristahustle.com/the-ek43-part-two/|title=The EK43 Part Two - Matt Perger|website=Matt Perger|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref>\n\nYields depend primarily on ''temperature,'' ''brew time,'' and ''grind size,'' and in a complex way on ''method''. Yield is inverse to grind size (smaller grinds have more surface area, so extract faster) and increases roughly linear with time, as the extraction proceeds. Thus for a given temperature and grind size, there is an ideal brew time, with larger grinds requiring longer brewing. French press features the largest grinds of conventional methods, hence the longest brewing, on the order of 3\u20134 minutes, while filter coffee has smaller grinds and shorter brewing, and espresso has yet smaller grinds and shorter brewing, on the order of 20\u201330 seconds.\n\n[[Caffeine]] is extracted early, so higher yields do not yield more caffeinated coffee, only over-extracted coffee.\n\nOnce ideal yield has been reached, the grounds must be removed from the liquid, otherwise extraction continues and the coffee will grow increasingly over-extracted. For this reason, it is advised to pour out a [[French press]] when it has finished brewing, and [[Coffee percolator|percolators]] are frowned upon.\n\nIt is possible to use less ground coffee and over-extract it to achieve a desired strength, which economizes on coffee but yields a bitterer, less tasty beverage.\n\nWater temperature is subtler but crucial to the proper extraction of flavor from the ground coffee, as it affects the proportions in which solubles are extracted \u2013 one wishes to extract the desired flavors as much as possible, and the undesirable flavors as little as possible. The recommended brewing temperature range of coffee is 91&ndash;94&nbsp;\u00b0C (195&ndash;202&nbsp;\u00b0F), which is a trade-off between these goals.<ref name=\"rao\">{{ citation | last1 = Rao | first1 = Scott | title = Everything but Espresso | year = 2010 }}</ref> If cooler, some of the solubles that make up the flavor will not be extracted. If the water is too hot, some undesirable, bitter, elements will be extracted, adversely affecting the taste. Note that this desired temperature range is slightly below the [[boiling point]] of water (100&nbsp;\u00b0C or 212&nbsp;\u00b0F at standard pressure), so coffee is best made with water that has been allowed to come off the boil slightly. Another consideration is the difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the coffee slurry: for example, certain brewing methods (e.g., manual pourover) can result in losing a significant amount of heat to the atmosphere during the brewing process.<ref name=\"rao\"/>\n\nTransient temperature is not very significant: if coffee is heated to boiling point only very briefly, the taste will be little affected; the longer it is kept at a high temperature the worse the taste becomes.\n\n== Strength ==\nStrength refers to the amount of dissolved coffee solids per unit of coffee liquid volume. An espresso, specifically a [[ristretto]], is the strongest of coffee drinks, meaning that it takes the same amount of coffee solubles and dissolves it in significantly less water. For example, a 20% extraction of 15 grams of espresso in a double shot (60 mL) yields 3 grams per 60 mL, or 5% strength, which is 3\u20134&times; typical brewed coffee strength.\n\nAdding water to dilute a drink after brewing affects strength but not yield (as the grounds are no longer present) \u2013 an [[caff\u00e8 Americano|Americano]] differs from an espresso simply by being weaker, more dilute (American preparation may also eliminate the crema).\n\nStronger coffee (assuming the same extraction yield) is not more bitter than weaker coffee, but simply has more solids. This is reflected in being darker and in thicker mouthfeel (oilier), though mouthfeel also depends on ''suspended'' solids (very small grinds, so-called \"fines\"), particularly in French press as opposed to filter.\n\nUnlike yield, desired strength varies measurably between regions, and, assuming proper (20%) yield, strength is determined by brewing ratio \u2013 how much ground coffee is used for a particular drink.<ref>{{Citation\n| title = Don't Be Afraid of Strong Coffee!\n| journal = The Atlantic\n| date = March 31, 2009\n| first = Jerry\n| last = Baldwin\n| accessdate = 2010-03-28\n| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/food/archive/2009/03/dont-be-afraid-of-strong-coffee/1360/\n}}</ref> Coffee above the ideal may be considered \"too strong\", while coffee below the ideal may be considered \"too weak\", but individual tastes vary significantly.\n\n== Brewing ratio ==\nThe usual ratio of coffee to water for the style of coffee most prevalent in Europe, America, and other Westernized nations (evident in publications such as textbooks on coffee and instruction [[user manual|manual]]s for drip-brew machines) is between one and two [[tablespoon]]s of ground coffee per six ounces (180 millilitres) of water; the full two tablespoons per six ounces tends to be recommended by experienced coffee lovers. A more exact weight ratio of 1:17 coffee and water is also used in publications.\n\nThe ideal brewing ratio is determined by which brewing ratio line in the control chart most intersects the ideal rectangle, or passes through the center (the subtle distinctions about ''exactly'' which line is ideal is generally considered too minor to comment, and changes brew ratio by only a small amount). This ideal ratio makes it most likely that one will land in the rectangle and near the center, and gives the widest room for error.\n\n== Brewing method ==\nExtraction depends in subtle and complex ways on brewing method. Simplest is directly mixing the grounds and water, as in [[Coffee cupping|cupping]], [[French press|press pot]], and [[Vacuum coffee maker|vacuum brewing]]. Note that in [[Turkish coffee]], the grounds are very finely ground and not removed from the water \u2013 this yields essentially 100% extraction of the solubles (over-extraction by Western standards), and suspension of the remaining insoluble parts of the grounds in the water. Significantly more complicated is brewing via soaking a column of grounds, as in filter, espresso, or percolation \u2013 in this case the water soaks and moves through the column of grounds, and (if there is water on top, as in espresso or percolation), a gradient develops over the column.\n\n=== Espresso ===\n{{Disputed-section|date=April 2014}}\nEspresso yield is generally 15\u201325%:<ref name=\"schulman\">{{Harv|Schulman|2007}}</ref> 25% is quoted as the Italian extraction in {{Harv|Illy|2005}}. Espresso yield has received significantly less attention in the literature than brewed coffee extraction, with the main references being {{Harv|Illy|2005}} and {{Harv|Schulman|2007}}.\n\nEspresso yield features a number of surprising properties:<ref name=\"schulman\"/>\n* yield depends primarily on depth of the \"puck\" (cylinder of coffee grounds);\n* yield is inverse to puck depth;\n* yield does not depend significantly on brewing time \u2013 yield at first increases approximately linearly, then plateaus after approximately 20 seconds;\n* strength is independent of dose.\n\nStrength depends instead on grind: finer grinds yield a \"shorter\" ([[ristretto]]) espresso (less liquid, so higher brew ratio, at same yield gives more strength), while coarser grinds yield a \"longer\" ([[lungo]]) espresso, while an intermediate grind yields a \"normale\" espresso.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |date=February 2007 | first = Jim | last = Schulman | title = Some Aspects of Espresso Extraction | accessdate = 2010-03-28 | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190921145056/http://www.coffeecuppers.com/Espresso.htm }}\n* {{ citation | last1 = Illy | last2 = Vianni | title = Espresso Coffee: the Science of Quality | year = 2005 | postscript =, Chapter 7, by M.

According to their bard, descendants of the Vir Bhadra were called Bhadras for 184 generations. After Tej Sen they were called Sens for 62 generations. For several generations thereafter they were called Muni and later Ghandras after King Vijaya Chand. Their last ruler was Shamsi, whose descendants are the present Dholpur dynasty.\n\nRajayapal Yadawa made Bayana his Capital in\n\nHistory of the Jats, End of Page-75\n\n1100 Vikram Samvat. Among the ancestors of Dholpur dynasty there was a king named Palansis Rao who was killed in Kanauj on the occasion of Sanyogita's Swayamwara (the self-selection of the groom by the girl). King Vijayapal who declared her his dharam sister gave his grandson Brahmadev and his mother queens Ghandra Kaumudi. When Shahabuddin Mohammad Ghori drove them out after killing the ruler. King Vijayapal had to face the invasion of Mohammad Ghori. He also had to fight against Abubakar Kandhari, Dharampal, and grandson of King. Sohan Pal founded the dynasty of Bichor. Their descendants are found both among the Jats and Rajputs. According to Colonel Todd, Chonkars, inspite of being Jats, are called Rajputs. in Mugal period some chhonkar jats accepted islam after shudhi andolan they joined chhonkar jadaun caste.they are now calling rajput chhodkar but original rajput donot marry them\n\nMadanpal had a son called Subaipal, who drove out Kriah Raja of Digh and established his rule there. The Chonkar gotra is found in Western and Eastern Punjab. There are ten villages belonging to the Chonkars in Aligarh district, two in Jullundur district and one in Ambala district.\n\nRam Swarup Joon[11] writes about Chhonkar and Sansanwal: This is the gotra of the Bharatpur ruling dynasty. Their original gotra is Yadu. As they settled down in a village called Sansani, they became known as Sansanwal. They raised their voice against the atrocities of Aurangzeb, protected the Hindu Dharma and established a new capital. One Yaduvanshi ancestor belonging to this gotra, named Brij Raj ruled over the territory called Brij after his name. These people had returned home from Dwarka and their capital was Mathura, in the 64th generation of King Brij Raj.\n\nRam Sarup Joon[12] writes that...about 70 Jat Gotras joined the Gujar force and started calling themselves Gujars. Chhonker is one of them.\n\nRam Sarup Joon[13] writes that...The Gondal, Tiwana, Janjeha, Dahiya, Chhonkar, Khokhar Rajputs converted from Jats in comparatively recent times.\n\n==Modern fashion==\nIn recent years, chokers have been popular with a number of celebrities including [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards.

It was [[The Three Stooges]]' first and only pilot made with [[Shemp Howard]] in the role of the third stooge. Filmed before a live [[studio audience]], it was a pilot for a planned TV series on the then-new [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television Network]]; the series never went into production due to objections from [[Columbia Pictures]], who held the trio under contract. The pilot film is currently in the [[public domain]] and is available on home video.\n\n==Plot==\nThe overall concept of the series was that each week The Stooges would try a different job or trade to see if eventually they might succeed; the comedy would ensue as each career they tried would eventually turn into a fiasco. In the pilot they try their hand as interior decorators. In their office, they meet a new client, Mr. Pennyfeather ([[Emil Sitka]]). Just a few moments after Pennyfeather arrives, Shemp accidentally spills ink down the front of Pennyfeather's suit, who becomes enraged. The Stooges then challenge Pennyfeather to mischief with them, featuring the famous \"Texas\" routine. After the some slapstick mayhem, they are successful in tossing Mr. Pennyfeather out of the office. Suddenly, the next client calls him on the phone for them to come in to manage her house. In her house, The Stooges not only hang wallpaper, but also manage to trash their client's home. Unfortunately, that woman is Mrs. Pennyfeather ([[Symona Boniface]] in her last on-camera performance before her death) and that house is Mr. Pennyfeather's house. After Mr. Pennyfeather comes home, the Stooges cover Mr. Pennyfeather with wallpaper and both Mr. Pennyfeather and the Stooges recognize each other (after Pennyfeather imitates the \"Texas\" routine done for him earlier by the Stooges).  In a rage, as the trio attempts to sneak out of the house, both Pennyfeathers attack the boys with their own paint and utensils; the Pennyfeathers also snipe at each other for hiring them. \n\nIn the end, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, defeated and severely injured, remove \"interior decorators\" from the long list of services (listed on their office door) they offer. The list included other comically misspelled potential occupations for the trio for future episodes: physicians, surgeons, lawyers, engineers (civil, aeronautical, electrical and chemical), psychiatrists, optometrists (and \"downtown-etrists\"), bank examiners, real estate brokers (and broke estate realers), income tax preparers and babysitters (18 and over only).\n\nTo avert a legal hassle, Columbia instead licensed a package of 30 shorts from the film series to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>Grossman, Gary H.

The Stooges then challenge Pennyfeather to mischief with them, featuring the famous \"Texas\" routine. After the some slapstick mayhem, they are successful in tossing Mr. Pennyfeather out of the office. Suddenly, the next client calls him on the phone for them to come in to manage her house. In her house, The Stooges not only hang wallpaper, but also manage to trash their client's home. Unfortunately, that woman is Mrs. Pennyfeather ([[Symona Boniface]] in her last on-camera performance before her death) and that house is Mr. Pennyfeather's house. After Mr. Pennyfeather comes home, the Stooges cover Mr. Pennyfeather with wallpaper and both Mr. Pennyfeather and the Stooges recognize each other (after Pennyfeather imitates the \"Texas\" routine done for him earlier by the Stooges).  In a rage, as the trio attempts to sneak out of the house, both Pennyfeathers attack the boys with their own paint and utensils; the Pennyfeathers also snipe at each other for hiring them. \n\nIn the end, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, defeated and severely injured, remove \"interior decorators\" from the long list of services (listed on their office door) they offer. The list included other comically misspelled potential occupations for the trio for future episodes: physicians, surgeons, lawyers, engineers (civil, aeronautical, electrical and chemical), psychiatrists, optometrists (and \"downtown-etrists\"), bank examiners, real estate brokers (and broke estate realers), income tax preparers and babysitters (18 and over only).\n\nTo avert a legal hassle, Columbia instead licensed a package of 30 shorts from the film series to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>Grossman, Gary H.

The 26-episode sequel, ''Pogles Wood'', was shown as part of the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' strand, whose target audience was pre-school children (meaning, in the 1960s, children under 5 years of age): a somewhat younger audience than that for ''Clapperboard''.<ref>[http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/oldott/www.offthetelly.co.uk/index9a5c.html?page_id=764 OffTheTelly.co.uk - ''Now Where Shall We Find The Pogles?'']</ref>\n\nThe 32 episodes were filmed using stop-frame animation, in [[Peter Firmin]]'s barn (not in a BBC television studio). All were made in black-and-white. The episodes were narrated by [[Oliver Postgate]], who introduced the story (typically beginning each episode with the show's catchphrase, ''Now where shall we find the Pogles?'') and also voiced several of the characters.\n\nThe Pogles were tiny magical beings who lived in a hollow tree in a wood. The four principals were Mr and Mrs Pogle, their adopted son Pippin, and a squirrel-like creature named Tog, who was Pippin's playmate.\n\n==Original series - \"The Pogles\"==\n\nThe initial series featuring these characters was entitled ''The Pogles'', and was broadcast by the BBC in 1965. It had only a single showing.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nComprising six episodes, of nine minutes each, it set the scene for the sequel series entitled ''Pogles Wood''. The original series told how the Magic Plant came to live with Mr and Mrs Pogle... and also revealed the truth about Pippin's real identity, as the foundling son of the King of the Fairies (Pippin is seen only as a baby, and Tog does not appear at all).\n\nHowever, the story centred on a dark and evil old shape-changing Witch, and the overall tone of the series was sinister and disturbing. It was so scary that, after broadcasting it only once, the BBC declared it \"too frightening\" (for its proposed inclusion in ''[[Watch with Mother]]'', which had a very young audience), and asked [[Oliver Postgate]] to make all future episodes revolve around more everyday countryside matters.<ref>[http://www.dragons-friendly-society.co.uk/pogles/pogvhs.htm The BBC declared the 1965 series ''too frightening'']</ref>\n\nTo reinforce the changes, the title of the show was itself changed; and the original series was never aired again.\n\n===Episodes===\n\n*1: The Magic Bean&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (29 July 1965)\n*2: A Silver Crown&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( 5 Aug 1965)\n*3: Pogle Go Home!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(12 Aug 1965)\n*4: A Flower For Wishes&nbsp; &nbsp;(19 Aug 1965)\n*5: The Singing Bird&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(26 Aug 1965)\n*6: King of The Fairies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( 2 Sep 1965)\n\n==Sequel series - \"Pogles' Wood\"==\n\nThe subsequent 26 episodes were broadcast under the revised title ''Pogles' Wood''. This was shown as part of the ''Watch With Mother'' strand (billed by the BBC as ''for the very young''). In this revised show the episodes were each 15 minutes long, to fit the standard length for editions of ''Watch With Mother''.\n\nThe first 13 episodes of the revised show centred on farm and countryside life, viewed through the eyes of Pippin, Tog, and Mr & Mrs Pogle. The second set of 13 programmes had a stronger story element, wherein Pippin and Tog typically find an object and take it back to the storytelling plant, who brings it to life (in a precursor of the later ''[[Bagpuss]]'' show).\n\nRepeats from ''Pogles Wood'' continued until September 1973, when the series was retired, as BBC children's television finally moved fully over to a colour service. The umbrella series, ''Watch With Mother'', continued (though with a change of name): but thereafter broadcast only those of its regular shows which had been made in colour.\n\n===Episodes===\n\n'''Series 1 (April 1966-June 1966):'''\n\n*Grains of Wheat\n*Milk From The Dairy\n*Honey Bees\n*Sheep's Wool\n*Eggs For Breakfast\n*Trains\n*Tog-In-The-Middle (Sometimes billed in Radio Times as Pig-In-The-Middle)\n*The Secret House\n*Noisy Engines\n*Badgers and Beans\n*Bears in the Wood\n*Tree Farming\n*Cake Crumbs\n*Keep Clear of The Water\n\n'''Series 2 (October 1967-January 1968):'''\n\n*Woodwinds\n*Strong Music\n*A Little House\n*Bears In The Wood\n*Bricks\n*A Paper Tiger\n*The Princess and The Jewel\n*Flowers\n*Kings and Queens\n*Clocks\n*Woodwork\n*Roundabouts\n*Umbrellas\n\n==Comics==\n\n''The Adventures of Pippin and Tog'' was a popular children's [[Annual publication|hardback]] based on the television show, published annually each Christmas in the 1970s.
