From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].

He assumed management positions at various [[state-owned companies]]. In 1978, he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Pagoh]]. During his term as Member of Parliament, he was appointed [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Malaysia|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|minister of foreign affairs]], [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Deputy ministers|deputy minister of federal territories]] and later [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Composition before cabinet dissolution|deputy minister of trade and industry]].

He received his secondary education at the Muar High School, Johor. Subsequently, he attended the [[University of Malaya]], Kuala Lumpur and received an honours bachelor's degree in economics and Malay studies in 1971.\n\n==Early career==\nAfter the completion of his studies, Muhyiddin joined the Johor state public service as the assistant secretary of training and scholarship. In 1974, he was appointed the assistant district officer (ADO) of [[Muar District|Muar]]. He left the civil service to join the corporate sector in the Johor State Economic Development Corporation (PKENJ), managing its subsidiary companies like Sergam Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131977), Equity Mal (Johore) Sdn Bhd as Director (1974\u20131978), Sri Saujana Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131978) and SGS Ates (M) Sdn Bhd as [[Human Resources Manager]] (1974).\n\n== Political career ==\nMuhyiddin's involvement in politics began when he joined [[UMNO]] as ordinary member at the [[Pagoh]] division in 1971. He was elected as [[UMNO]] Youth Chief of the Pagoh division and the Secretary in 1976. Later he became Youth Chief of Johor state [[UMNO]] Youth until 1987.\n\nMuhyiddin occupied the seats of Exco in the national Malaysia UMNO Youth. In 1984, Muhyiddin was elected the UMNO Division Chief of Pagoh replacing [[Othman Saat]]. Muhyiddin rose up the ranks and file of Johor UMNO quickly. From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].

He became a executive council member (EXCO) of the [[Johor State Executive Council]] in 1958.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1964, Othman was appointed EXCO member in charge of the Local Government and Housing portfolio and initiated low-cost housing schemes for the poor and opened the [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (Felda) and [[FELCRA Berhad]] land schemes in Johor during the tenure of [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|prime minister]] [[Abdul Razak Hussein]] in the 1970s.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Menteri Besar of Johor===\nOn April 4, 1967, at the age of 43, Othman was appointed the 11th Chief Minister of Johor. He held this position for three terms until 1982. His fate changed when Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]] became prime minister with [[Musa Hitam]] as his deputy.<ref name=\":3\" /> Musa Hitam was said to have used all means from UMNO headquarters in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to weaken Othman's influence. This is the starting point of the fall of his political career.\n\nJournalist Chamil Wariya, in his book 'Crisis of the Sultan - the Chief Minister, what really happened', describes the crisis between Othman and the [[Sultan of Johor]]. The then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Musa Hitam, reprimanded Othman for allegedly giving timber and land areas based on political considerations. Othman was ordered to stop the practice. He is seen as the Chief Minister for a long time and should provide access to young people.\n\n[[Iskandar of Johor|Tunku Mahmood Iskandar]], who had just been re-appointed as the Crown Prince of Johor, urged Othman to immediately resign for questioning the legitimacy of the crown prince.<ref name=\"Kershaw103\">Kershaw (2001), pg 103</ref> Several demonstrations were reportedly planned to be held in several places including [[Kota Tinggi]].<ref>'The 1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis: two views and select ...', Simon Barraclough, P.

He had served in that position for 14 years.\n\nA few years later, in 1987, he joined the newly formed [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]-helmed political party S46 to challenge UMNO in the [[1990 Malaysian general election]].<ref name=\":3\" /> However, the party did not succeed and was later dissolved.\n\n==Personal life==\nOthman was born in ''Kampung Tengah'' (Tengah Village), [[Muar (town)|Muar]], [[Johor]] to a wealthy rice trader.\n\nOthman has nine children from three marriages, 32 grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.

But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, One must not exalt one&rsquo;s creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others Without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.</blockquote>\n\nEmperor [[Kharvela]] (born in the family of Rajarshi Vasu) declares himself in his inscription (approximately 2nd century BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0103&L=INDOLOGY&P=R6520&I=-3 |title=INDOLOGY archives \u2013 March 2001 (#143) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\nsava pasa-nd-a-puujako, sava devaayatan-sanskaarako\n\nI am worshipper of all sects, restorer of all shrines. \n}}\n\nKharvela's self-description must be contrasted with other rulers around the world, who took pride in calling themselves \"but-shikan\" or \"defender of the (only true) faith\".\n\nBadayuni in his Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh reports that the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], who had established the [[Din-i-Ilahi]] faith, decreed the following in AH 1000 (1551\u20131552 CE):\n\n<blockquote>Hindus who, when young, had from pressure become Musalmans, were allowed to go back to the faith of their fathers. No man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and every one should be allowed to change his religion, if he liked. ...People should not be molested, if they wished to build churches and prayer rooms, or idol temples, or fire temples.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Sikh]] Gurus built freedom of religion in their faith to such an extent that while being a persecuted minority themselves under many Mughal rulers like [[Aurangzeb]], [[Sikhs]] felt obliged to fight for the religious freedom of others. The sixth Guru of Sikhs, [[Guru Hargobind]], even had a mosque built for his Muslim disciples, instead of putting them under any pressure to adopt the Sikh faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010224/windows/main1.htm|title=The Tribune - Windows - Main Feature|website=tribuneindia.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\nThe tradition of religious freedom continued under [[Sikh Empire]], and other Sikh Principalities where Sikh rulers commissioned several Gurdwaras, Temples and Mosques for their subjects of various faiths.\n\n===Refuge from religious persecution===\nIndia, with its traditional tolerance, has served as a refuge for groups that have encountered persecution elsewhere.\n\n*Jews: Jews in India were granted lands and trading rights. The oldest of the three longest-established Jewish communities in India, traders from [[Judea]] and [[Israel]] arrived in the city of [[Cochin]], in what is now [[Kerala]], 2,500 years ago and are now known as [[Cochin Jews]].

In the west, state and church(religion) is separate and do not intervene in each other's internal affairs. But this is not the case with India, here secularism means 'respect for all religions' and 'keeping a principled distance' from each religion. The Indian constitution permits the central government to intervene in religion but this intervention should be based on constitution only. If some tenets, principles or beliefs of any particular religion violates the constitution or the law of the land, then the Indian government is mandated to intervene and remedy the situation. [[Government of India]] has for a few times have intervened in religions historically as mandated by the constitution. The enactment of anti-untouchability act(SC/ST Act,1989) and also the recent law banning triple talak among the Muslim community is example of this constitutionally mandated intervention. Government also intervene when women of any religion are denied opportunities or equality as gender equality is guaranteed by the Indian constitution.\n\nArticle 25 (2b) uses the term \"Hindus\" for all classes and sections of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Sikhs and Buddhists objected to this wording that makes many Hindu [[Personal laws in India|personal laws]] applicable to them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-03-07|isbn = 9781134722297|first = Kevin|last = Boyle|first2 = Juliet|last2 = Sheen|pages = 191\u2013192|access-date = 15 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513181649/https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|archive-date = 13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a [[Kirpan]].<ref>The Constitution of India, Right to Freedom of religion, Article 25 | {{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Religions require no registration.

But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, One must not exalt one&rsquo;s creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others Without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.</blockquote>\n\nEmperor [[Kharvela]] (born in the family of Rajarshi Vasu) declares himself in his inscription (approximately 2nd century BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0103&L=INDOLOGY&P=R6520&I=-3 |title=INDOLOGY archives \u2013 March 2001 (#143) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\nsava pasa-nd-a-puujako, sava devaayatan-sanskaarako\n\nI am worshipper of all sects, restorer of all shrines. \n}}\n\nKharvela's self-description must be contrasted with other rulers around the world, who took pride in calling themselves \"but-shikan\" or \"defender of the (only true) faith\".\n\nBadayuni in his Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh reports that the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], who had established the [[Din-i-Ilahi]] faith, decreed the following in AH 1000 (1551\u20131552 CE):\n\n<blockquote>Hindus who, when young, had from pressure become Musalmans, were allowed to go back to the faith of their fathers. No man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and every one should be allowed to change his religion, if he liked. ...People should not be molested, if they wished to build churches and prayer rooms, or idol temples, or fire temples.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Sikh]] Gurus built freedom of religion in their faith to such an extent that while being a persecuted minority themselves under many Mughal rulers like [[Aurangzeb]], [[Sikhs]] felt obliged to fight for the religious freedom of others.

In the west, state and church(religion) is separate and do not intervene in each other's internal affairs. But this is not the case with India, here secularism means 'respect for all religions' and 'keeping a principled distance' from each religion. The Indian constitution permits the central government to intervene in religion but this intervention should be based on constitution only. If some tenets, principles or beliefs of any particular religion violates the constitution or the law of the land, then the Indian government is mandated to intervene and remedy the situation. [[Government of India]] has for a few times have intervened in religions historically as mandated by the constitution. The enactment of anti-untouchability act(SC/ST Act,1989) and also the recent law banning triple talak among the Muslim community is example of this constitutionally mandated intervention. Government also intervene when women of any religion are denied opportunities or equality as gender equality is guaranteed by the Indian constitution.\n\nArticle 25 (2b) uses the term \"Hindus\" for all classes and sections of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Sikhs and Buddhists objected to this wording that makes many Hindu [[Personal laws in India|personal laws]] applicable to them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-03-07|isbn = 9781134722297|first = Kevin|last = Boyle|first2 = Juliet|last2 = Sheen|pages = 191\u2013192|access-date = 15 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513181649/https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|archive-date = 13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a [[Kirpan]].<ref>The Constitution of India, Right to Freedom of religion, Article 25 | {{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Religions require no registration.

{"title_page": "History of ancient Lebanon", "text_new": "{{History of Lebanon (ancient)}} \n{{main|History of Lebanon}}\n\nThe '''history of ancient Lebanon''' traces the course of events in what is now known as [[Lebanon]] from the beginning of history to the [[History of Lebanon under Arab rule|beginning of Arab rule]].\n\n== Prehistoric Times ==\nThe earliest known settlements in Lebanon date back to earlier than 5000 BC. In [[Byblos]], which is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, archaeologists have discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars which are evidence of the [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 8,000 years ago.\n\n== Ancient Near East ==\n{{main|Canaan|Phoenicia}}\n{{See also|Phoenicians and wine}}\n\n===Bronze Age===\nThe area now known as Lebanon first appeared in recorded history around 4000 BC as a group of coastal cities and a heavily forested hinterland. It was inhabited by the [[Canaanites]], a [[Semitic people]], whom the Greeks called \"Phoenicians\" because of the purple (phoinikies) dye they sold. These early inhabitants referred to themselves as \"men of Sidon\" or the like, according to their city of origin, and called the country \"Lebanon.\" Because of the nature of the country and its location, the Phoenicians turned to the sea, where they engaged in trade and navigation.\n\nEach of the coastal cities was an independent kingdom noted for the special activities of its inhabitants. [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] were important maritime and trade centers; Gubla (later known as [[Byblos]] and now as Jubayl) and Berytus (present-day [[Beirut]]) were trade and religious centers. Gubla was the first Phoenician city to trade actively with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the pharaohs of the [[Old Kingdom]] (2686-2181 BC), exporting cedar, olive oil, and wine, while importing gold and other products from the Nile Valley.\n\nBefore the end of the 17th century BC, Lebanese-Egyptian relations were interrupted when the [[Hyksos]], a nomadic Semitic people, conquered Egypt. After about three decades of Hyksos rule (1600-1570 BC), [[Ahmose I]] (1570-1545 BC), Theban prince, launched the Egyptian liberation war. Opposition to the Hyksos increased, reaching a peak during the reign of the pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] (1490-1436 BC), who invaded Syria, put an end to Hyksos domination, and incorporated Lebanon into the Egyptian Empire.\n\nToward the end of the 14th century BC, the Egyptian Empire weakened, and Lebanon was able to regain its independence by the beginning of the 12th century BC. The subsequent three centuries were a period of prosperity and freedom from foreign control during which the earlier Phoenician invention of the [[alphabet]] facilitated communications and trade. The Phoenicians also excelled not only in producing textiles but also in carving ivory, in working with metal, and above all in making glass. Masters of the art of navigation, they founded colonies wherever they went in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (specifically in [[Cyprus]], [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Carthage]]) and established trade routes to Europe and western Asia. These colonies and trade routes flourished until the invasion of the coastal areas by the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]].\n\n===Assyrian rule===\n{{main|Phoenicia under Assyrian rule}}\nAssyrian rule (875-608 BE) deprived the Phoenician cities of their independence and prosperity and brought repeated, unsuccessful rebellions. In the middle of the 8th century BC, Tyre and Byblos rebelled, but the Assyrian ruler, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], subdued the rebels and imposed heavy tributes. Oppression continued unabated, and Tyre rebelled again, this time against [[Sargon II]] (722-705 BC), who successfully besieged the city in 721 BC and punished its population. During the 7th century BC, Sidon rebelled and was completely destroyed by [[Esarhaddon]] (681-668 BC); its inhabitants were enslaved. Esarhaddon built a new city on Sidon's ruins. By the end of the 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire, weakened by the successive revolts, had been destroyed by the [[Medes|Median Empire]].\n\n===Babylonian rule===\n{{main|Phoenicia under Babylonian rule}}\nAs the Babylonians finally defeated the Assyrians at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], much of Lebanon was already in their hands, since much of it was seized from the collapsing Assyrian kingdom. In that time two Babylonian kings succeeded the throne, [[Nabopolassar]] who focused on ending Assyrian influence in the region, and his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] whose reign witnessed several regional rebellions, especially in Jerusalem. Revolts in Phoenician cities became more frequent during that period (685-636 BC, Tyre rebelled again and for thirteen years resisted a siege by the troops of Nebuchadnezzar 587-574 BC. After this long siege, the city capitulated; its king was dethroned, and its citizens were enslaved.\n\n===Achaemenid Empire===\n{{Infobox Former Subdivision\n|native_name = Achaemenid Phoenicia\n|common_name = Phoenicia\n|era       = [[Achaemenid Empire]]\n|subdivision  = Province\n|nation     = the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]\n|year_start  = c.538 BC\n|year_end    = c.332 BC\n|p1          = Phoenicia under Babylonian rule\n|image_map              = Achaemenid Empire.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = Phoenicia within The [[Achaemenid Empire]], 500 BC.\n|image_coat =\n|p2          = Neo-Babylonian Empire\n|flag_p2     = Nebukadnessar II.jpg\n|s1          = Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule\n|s2          = Macedonia (ancient kingdom)\n|flag_s2     = Vergina_sun.svg\n|capital     = [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]\n|event_start  = [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great\u2019s]] invasion of [[Babylonia]]\n|event_end    = [[Conquests of Alexander the Great]]\n}}\nThe [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] province of [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Phoenicia]] and its neighbors passed to [[Achaemenids|Achaemenid]] rule with the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539/8 BC.\n<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0015)]</ref>\n\nThe Syro-Phoenician coastal cities remained under Persian rule for the following two centuries.\nThe Phoenician navy supported Persia during the [[Greco-Persian War]] (490-49 BC).

He attacked [[Asia Minor]], defeated the Persian troops in 333 BC, and advanced toward the Lebanese coast. Initially the Phoenician cities made no attempt to resist, and they recognized his suzerainty. However, when Alexander tried to offer a sacrifice to [[Melqart]], Tyre's god, the city resisted. Alexander besieged Tyre in retaliation in early 332 BC. After six months of resistance, the city fell, and its people were sold into slavery. Despite his early death in 323 BC, Alexander's conquest of the eastern Mediterranean Basin left a Greek imprint on the area. The Phoenicians, being a cosmopolitan people amenable to outside influences, adopted aspects of Greek civilization with ease.\n\n====The Seleucid Dynasty====\nAfter Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his Macedonian generals. The eastern part\u2014Phoenicia, Asia Minor, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia fell to [[Seleucus I]], founder of the [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The southern part of Syria and Egypt fell to [[Ptolemy]], and the European part, including Macedonia, to [[Antigonus I]]. This settlement, however, failed to bring peace because Seleucus I and Ptolemy clashed repeatedly in the course of their ambitious efforts to share in Phoenician prosperity. A final victory of the Seleucids ended a forty-year period of conflict.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{main|Phoenicia under Roman rule}}\n[[File:Tomb in Tyre (small).JPG|frame|right|Inscription in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] on one of the tombs found in the Roman-Byzantine [[List of necropoleis|necropolis]] in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].]] The last century of Seleucid rule was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles. These ended in 64 BC, when the Roman general [[Pompey]] added [[Seleucid Syria]] and Lebanon as a [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Roman province]] to the [[Roman Empire]]. Economic and intellectual activities flourished in Lebanon during the [[Pax Romana]]. The inhabitants of the principal Phoenician cities of Byblos, Sidon, and Tyre were granted [[Roman citizenship]]. These cities were centers of the pottery, glass, and purple dye industries; their harbors also served as warehouses for products imported from Syria, Persia, and India. They exported cedar, perfume, jewelry, wine, and fruit to Rome. Economic prosperity led to a revival in construction and urban development; temples and palaces were built throughout the country, as well as paved roads that linked the main cities like Heliopolis and [[Berytus]]. \n\nIndeed, starting in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE (reign of [[Augustus]])  and over a period of two centuries (reign of [[Philip the Arab]]), the Romans built a huge temple complex in Heliopolis (actual [[Baalbek]]) on a pre-existing [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] consisting of three temples: Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus. On a nearby hill, they built a fourth temple dedicated to Mercury.\n\nFurthermore, the veterans of two [[Roman legion]]s were established in the city of Berytus (actual Beirut): the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zMJqGTSUmH8C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=la+romana+berytus&source=bl&ots=FD5mrIXgtw&sig=zWUK0P9GlPb0fAKBUbxt_bS4h7c&hl=it&ei=B4oLTrflBYWhtwfZ_Ix6&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=la%20romana%20berytus&f=false Roman Berytus: a colony of legionaries]</ref> The city quickly became Romanized.

Retrieved November 17, 2007.</ref>\n[[File:Baalbek(js) 19.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Actual ruins of [[Baalbeck|Heliopolis]]]]\n\nUnder the Romans, [[Berytus]] was enriched by the dynasty of [[Herod the Great]], and was made a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus'', in 14 BC. [[Law School of Beirut|Beirut's school of law]] was widely known at the time.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120524192722/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-230135 Beirut], Britannica.com</ref> Two of Rome's most famous jurists, [[Papinian]] and [[Ulpian]], both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] emperors. \n\nFurthermore, The city of Heliopolis was made a ''colonia'' by [[Septimius Severus]] in 193 AD, having been part of the territory of Berytus on the Phoenician coast since 15 BC. Work on the religious complex there lasted over a century and a half and was never completed. The dedication of the present temple ruins, the largest religious building in the entire Roman empire, dates from the reign of Septimus Severus, whose coins first show the two temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns of [[Caracalla]] (211-217 CE) and [[Philip the Arab]] (244-249 CE). In commemoration of the dedication of the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the rights of the ''[[ius Italicum]]'' on the city. Today, only six Corinthian columns remain standing of this huge Jupiter temple.\n\nSeverus also separated the area of modern Lebanon and parts of Syria from the greater province of [[Syria Coele]], and formed the new province of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 AD, the empire was divided in two: the eastern or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] part with its capital at [[Constantinople]], and the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] part with its capital at [[Rome]]. Under the Byzantine Empire, intellectual and economic activities in Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon continued to flourish for more than a century. However, in the 6th century a series of earthquakes demolished the temples of [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] and destroyed the Romanized [[Berytus|city of Beirut]], leveling its [[Law School of Beirut|famous law school]] and killing nearly 30,000 inhabitants. To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension produced disorder and confusion. Furthermore, the ecumenical councils of the 5th and 6th centuries were unsuccessful in settling religious disagreements. This turbulent period weakened the empire and made it easy prey to the newly converted [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Arab]]s of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Laurence Waddell]]\n* [[Frederick Haberman]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n''This article is based on public-domain text from the [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lbtoc.html Lebanon Country Study] (1987) of the [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies project; specifically from Chapter 1: Historical Setting, by Afaf Sabeh McGowen''.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Tracing-our-ancestors-Frederick-Haberman/dp/B0006RJPMG Tracing our ancestors by Frederick Haberman (Author)]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/TracingOurAncestors/Tracing%20our%20Ancestors_djvu.txt Full text of \"Tracing Our Ancestors\"]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Web-Illuminati-Kevin-Tucker/dp/1304034798 Web of the Illuminati by Kevin Tucker (Author)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Ancient Lebanon}}\n[[Category:Ancient Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Ancient history by country|Lebanon]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Lebanon (ancient)}} \n{{main|History of Lebanon}}\n\nThe '''history of ancient Lebanon''' traces the course of events in what is now known as [[Lebanon]] from the beginning of history to the [[History of Lebanon under Arab rule|beginning of Arab rule]].\n\n== Prehistoric Times ==\nThe earliest known settlements in Lebanon date back to earlier than 5000 BC.

They exported cedar, perfume, jewelry, wine, and fruit to Rome. Economic prosperity led to a revival in construction and urban development; temples and palaces were built throughout the country, as well as paved roads that linked the main cities like Heliopolis and [[Berytus]]. \n\nIndeed, starting in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE (reign of [[Augustus]])  and over a period of two centuries (reign of [[Philip the Arab]]), the Romans built a huge temple complex in Heliopolis (actual [[Baalbek]]) on a pre-existing [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] consisting of three temples: Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus. On a nearby hill, they built a fourth temple dedicated to Mercury.\n\nFurthermore, the veterans of two [[Roman legion]]s were established in the city of Berytus (actual Beirut): the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zMJqGTSUmH8C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=la+romana+berytus&source=bl&ots=FD5mrIXgtw&sig=zWUK0P9GlPb0fAKBUbxt_bS4h7c&hl=it&ei=B4oLTrflBYWhtwfZ_Ix6&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=la%20romana%20berytus&f=false Roman Berytus: a colony of legionaries]</ref> The city quickly became Romanized. Large public buildings and monuments were erected and Berytus enjoyed full status as a part of the empire.<ref name=DTBcom>[http://www.downtownbeirut.com/AboutBeirut.html About Beirut and Downtown Beirut], DownTownBeirut.com. Retrieved November 17, 2007.</ref>\n[[File:Baalbek(js) 19.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Actual ruins of [[Baalbeck|Heliopolis]]]]\n\nUnder the Romans, [[Berytus]] was enriched by the dynasty of [[Herod the Great]], and was made a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus'', in 14 BC. [[Law School of Beirut|Beirut's school of law]] was widely known at the time.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120524192722/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-230135 Beirut], Britannica.com</ref> Two of Rome's most famous jurists, [[Papinian]] and [[Ulpian]], both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] emperors. \n\nFurthermore, The city of Heliopolis was made a ''colonia'' by [[Septimius Severus]] in 193 AD, having been part of the territory of Berytus on the Phoenician coast since 15 BC. Work on the religious complex there lasted over a century and a half and was never completed. The dedication of the present temple ruins, the largest religious building in the entire Roman empire, dates from the reign of Septimus Severus, whose coins first show the two temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns of [[Caracalla]] (211-217 CE) and [[Philip the Arab]] (244-249 CE). In commemoration of the dedication of the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the rights of the ''[[ius Italicum]]'' on the city. Today, only six Corinthian columns remain standing of this huge Jupiter temple.\n\nSeverus also separated the area of modern Lebanon and parts of Syria from the greater province of [[Syria Coele]], and formed the new province of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 AD, the empire was divided in two: the eastern or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] part with its capital at [[Constantinople]], and the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] part with its capital at [[Rome]]. Under the Byzantine Empire, intellectual and economic activities in Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon continued to flourish for more than a century. However, in the 6th century a series of earthquakes demolished the temples of [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] and destroyed the Romanized [[Berytus|city of Beirut]], leveling its [[Law School of Beirut|famous law school]] and killing nearly 30,000 inhabitants. To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension produced disorder and confusion. Furthermore, the ecumenical councils of the 5th and 6th centuries were unsuccessful in settling religious disagreements. This turbulent period weakened the empire and made it easy prey to the newly converted [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Arab]]s of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Laurence Waddell]]\n* [[Frederick Haberman]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n''This article is based on public-domain text from the [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lbtoc.html Lebanon Country Study] (1987) of the [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies project; specifically from Chapter 1: Historical Setting, by Afaf Sabeh McGowen''.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Tracing-our-ancestors-Frederick-Haberman/dp/B0006RJPMG Tracing our ancestors by Frederick Haberman (Author)]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/TracingOurAncestors/Tracing%20our%20Ancestors_djvu.txt Full text of \"Tracing Our Ancestors\"]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Web-Illuminati-Kevin-Tucker/dp/1304034798 Web of the Illuminati by Kevin Tucker (Author)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Ancient Lebanon}}\n[[Category:Ancient Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Ancient history by country|Lebanon]]\n", "name_user": "Zurkhardo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAssyrian rule", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Lebanon"}

Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store.

Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]].

A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies.

The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside. When Herman returns home bloodied, Bess threatens to leave him and take the children to Canada if he continues his resistance.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Part 6\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = David Simon\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = September 1942. Violent anti-Semitic incidents continue to rise throughout the country. Winchell is shot and killed during an appearance in [[Louisville]]. At Winchell's funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and vehemently denounces Lindbergh. A concerned Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's ultimate statement is short and empty. Alvin is visited by Billy Murphy, a fellow soldier from his time in Canada, who coerces Alvin to join a secretive [[anti-fascist]] group that wants to overthrow Lindbergh; they need Alvin's radar expertise. They appear to be unsuccessful, but Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, which quickly takes hold in the United States as the government declares [[martial law]] and begins indiscriminately arresting prominent Jewish figures, including Bengelsdorf. Seldon, hysterical, calls Bess when his mother doesn't return home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, where they learn Selma has been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn visits Bess searching for sanctuary, but Bess furiously tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady issues a statement calling for peace, releasing the Jewish detainees, and announcing an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf, attempting to win back his colleagues, explains that Lindbergh's presidency was the result of a German blackmail operation which trained Lindbergh's son to be a [[Hitler Youth]], but they do not believe him. Alvin visits the Levins with his new fiancee, but gets into an altercation with Herman about their actions regarding Lindbergh.

Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store.

Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]].

A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks. Alvin flourishes in Canada's military program, and is recruited by British intelligence to help steal a German [[radar]] device.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies.

The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside. When Herman returns home bloodied, Bess threatens to leave him and take the children to Canada if he continues his resistance.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Part 6\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = David Simon\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = September 1942. Violent anti-Semitic incidents continue to rise throughout the country. Winchell is shot and killed during an appearance in [[Louisville]]. At Winchell's funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and vehemently denounces Lindbergh. A concerned Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's ultimate statement is short and empty. Alvin is visited by Billy Murphy, a fellow soldier from his time in Canada, who coerces Alvin to join a secretive anti-[[fascism]] group that wants to overthrow Lindbergh; they need Alvin's radar expertise. They appear to be unsuccessful, but Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, which quickly takes hold in the United States as the government declares [[martial law]] and begins indiscriminately arresting prominent Jewish figures, including Bengelsdorf. Seldon, hysterical, calls Bess when his mother doesn't return home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, where they learn Selma has been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn visits Bess searching for sanctuary, but Bess furiously tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady issues a statement calling for peace, releasing the Jewish detainees, and announcing an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf, attempting to win back his colleagues, explains that Lindbergh's presidency was the result of a German blackmail operation which trained Lindbergh's son to be a [[Hitler Youth]], but they do not believe him.
