After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]] in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle#Revival in the United Kingdom|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.  In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsensical writings]] and line drawings. Starting with 1967's \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums, his first solo LP ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', and the international top 10 singles <!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --> \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in the archway of his [[Manhattan, New York City|Manhattan]] apartment building by a Beatles fan, [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nBy 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"chartmasters.org\">{{cite web |url=https://chartmasters.org/2017/10/best-selling-artists-albums-and-singles-of-all-time/18/ |title=John Lennon's albums and songs sales |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> In 2002, he was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], and in 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"Julia offered the name in honour of&nbsp;...

In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to [[Blackpool]], secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand\"}} Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: \"Julia went out of the door&nbsp;... John ran after her\"}} According to author [[Mark Lewisohn]], however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=41-42}} Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]], with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children\"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: \"When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles\"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old, he often visited her at 1&nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: \"To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'\"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\n{{quote|A part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician.

Five ''strong'', ''intelligent'', ''beautiful'' women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn't deal with life.

The instrument was an inexpensive [[Gallotone Champion]] acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=45}} Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\"{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=89}} On 15 July 1958, Lennon's mother was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=48}}\n\nLennon's high school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour.

Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=738}} By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half-skiffle and half-[[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=95}} Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St Peter's Church]] garden f\u00eate. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}}\n\nMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=44}} According to McCartney's brother [[Mike McGear|Mike]], their father similarly disapproved of Lennon, declaring that Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=32}} McCartney's father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the family's front room at [[20 Forthlin Road|20{{nbsp}}Forthlin Road]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=38\u201339}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} During this time Lennon wrote his first song, \"[[Hello Little Girl]]\", which became a UK top 10 hit for [[the Fourmost]] in 1963.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=337\u2013338}}\n\nMcCartney recommended his friend [[George Harrison]] to be the lead guitarist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47, 50}} Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" for Lennon and was asked to join.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47}} [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=64}} Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night [[The Beatles in Hamburg|residency in Hamburg]], in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Lennon in 1964]]\n[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\"{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24\u201326: \"Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold\"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: \"He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt\"}} The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs{{nbsp}}... pop songs with no more thought of them than that \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}}... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2010|p=33}}\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|thumb|Ringo Starr, George Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1963]]\nThe Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands{{nbsp}}... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\"{{sfn|Shennan|2007}} After a year of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania in the UK]], the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]''.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=239\u2013240}} The Beatles received recognition from the British establishment when they were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[1965 Birthday Honours|1965 Queen's Birthday Honours]].{{sfn|London Gazette|1965|pp=5487\u20135489}}\n\nLennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=288}} Lennon's \"[[Help!

It was me singing 'help'\".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=268}} He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his \"Fat Elvis\" period),{{sfn|Lawrence|2005|p=62}} and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=171}} In March that year he and Harrison were unknowingly introduced to [[LSD]] when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=51\u201352}} When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire; Lennon recalled: \"We were all screaming{{nbsp}}... hot and hysterical.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=570}}\n{{Anchor|BiggerThanJesus}} In March 1966, during an interview with ''Evening Standard'' reporter [[Maureen Cleave]], Lennon remarked, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink{{nbsp}}... We're more popular than Jesus now \u2013 I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\"{{sfn|Cleave|2007}} The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused [[More popular than Jesus|great offence in the US]] when quoted by a magazine there five months later.

He said that the Beatles song \"[[Getting Better]]\" told his own story, \"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically \u2013 any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

That is why I am always on about peace.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=182}}\n\nRecalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

His marriage began just as [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=493\u2013495}} Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=113}}\n\nCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of [[LSD]], and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=496\u2013497}} When the group travelled by train to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], Wales in 1967 for the [[Maharishi Yogi]]'s Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage.{{sfn|Warner Brothers|1988}} After Cynthia arrived home at [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends.

After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her \u00a3100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=305\u2013306: \"He had agreed that I should have custody of Julian\", \"He raised his offer to \u00a3100,000\"}}\n\n===Brian Epstein===\n\n[[File:Aankomst Brian Epstein (manager Beatles) op Schiphol (Grand Gala du Disque 1965), Bestanddeelnr 918-2516 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Brian Epstein in 1965]]\n\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in November 1961 when they were introduced to [[Brian Epstein]] after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual, and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=232}} Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies [[Bob Wooler]] for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=1165, 1169}} but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=94, 119\u2013120}} Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: \"He called me a [[queer]] so I battered his bloody ribs in.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1169}}\n\nLennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered ''Queer Jew''; on learning of the eventual title, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he parodied, \"More like ''A Cellarful of Boys''\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=298\u2013299}} He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, \"Have you come to blackmail him?

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"[[Hey Jude]]\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}\n\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973.{{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252\u2013255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}\n\nIn a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.{{sfn|Badman|2003|p=393}}\n\n===Yoko Ono===\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Lennon and Ono in 1980]]\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=104}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.<ref name='MOMA'>{{cite web|title=Apple.

They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"[[Bagism]]\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, where the Beatles had performed [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|their rooftop concert]] three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on [[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]].

Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"[[May Pang#\"Lost Weekend\"|lost weekend]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698\u2013699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]]. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\n===Sean Lennon===\n[[File:Sean Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Sean Lennon at a [[Free Tibet]] event in 1998]]\nOno had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of [[househusband]], which he agreed to do.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=535, 690}}\n\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}\n\n===Former Beatles===\n{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}}} Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him.{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=146}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', \"I was hurt by it.

I'm not in the book.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934\u2013935}} According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}}... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}}... That ain't bad picking.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2010\u20132011|p=95}}\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music.

He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179\u2013181}}\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories \"remarkable&nbsp;... also very funny&nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". ''Book Week'' reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393\u2013394}}\n\nIn combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write'', co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]]. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396\u2013397}} In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|group masturbation]], for [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s play ''[[Oh!

After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]] in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle#Revival in the United Kingdom|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.  In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsensical writings]] and line drawings. Starting with 1967's \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums, his first solo LP ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', and the international top 10 singles <!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --> \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Controversial through his political and peace activism, after moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in the archway of his [[Manhattan, New York City|Manhattan]] apartment building by a Beatles fan, [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nBy 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"chartmasters.org\">{{cite web |url=https://chartmasters.org/2017/10/best-selling-artists-albums-and-singles-of-all-time/18/ |title=John Lennon's albums and songs sales |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> In 2002, he was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], and in 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Lennon was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/event/john-lennon/?flavour=mobile |title=Lennon's 70th birthday |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=8 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120534/http://rockhall.com/event/john-lennon/?flavour=mobile |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===1940\u20131957: Early years===\n[[File:Mendipsnationaltrust.JPG|thumb|alt=A grey two-storey building, with numerous windows visible on both levels|Lennon's home at 251 Menlove Avenue|left]]Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at [[Liverpool Maternity Hospital]] to [[Julia Lennon|Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley)]] (1914\u20131958) and [[Alfred Lennon]] (1912\u20131976). Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"Julia offered the name in honour of&nbsp;... Winston Churchill\"}} His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9{{nbsp}}Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother;{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: \"The entire Stanley clan gathered nightly at Newcastle Road\"}} the cheques stopped when he went [[AWOL|absent without leave]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=54: \"Until then he had sent her money each month from his wages, but now it stopped\"}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=26: \"In February 1944&nbsp;... he was arrested and imprisoned. Freddie subsequently disappeared for six months\"}} When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=27}} After her sister [[Mimi Smith|Mimi]] complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to [[Blackpool]], secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand\"}} Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: \"Julia went out of the door&nbsp;... John ran after her\"}} According to author [[Mark Lewisohn]], however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=41-42}} Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]], with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: \"Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children\"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: \"When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles\"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old, he often visited her at 1&nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: \"To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'\"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\n{{quote|A part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician.

They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Lennon in 1964]]\n[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\"{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24\u201326: \"Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold\"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: \"He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt\"}} The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks.

And the words were almost irrelevant\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}}...

Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help.

Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve \"artistic freedom within a business structure\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=31}} Released amid a period of [[Protests of 1968|civic unrest and protests]], the band's debut single for the Apple label included Lennon's B-side \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to [[Maoist]] revolution. The song's pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the [[New Left]] press.{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=60}} Adding to the tensions at the Beatles' recording sessions that year, Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]], beside him, thereby contravening the band's policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio.

Lennon asked [[Lord Beeching]] to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by [[Allen Klein]], who had managed [[the Rolling Stones]] and other bands during the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr,{{sfn|TelegraphKlein|2010}} but McCartney never signed the management contract.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=549: \"Paul never did sign the management contract\"}} Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 [[lithograph]]s called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from their honeymoon,{{sfn|Fawcett|1976|p=185}} eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=279}} Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles, and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins]]''{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=48\u201349}} (known more for its cover than for its music), ''[[Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions]]'' and ''[[Wedding Album]]''.

Epstein was homosexual, and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one?

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"[[Hey Jude]]\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}\n\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973.{{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252\u2013255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}\n\nIn a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=63}} After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.{{sfn|Badman|2003|p=393}}\n\n===Yoko Ono===\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Lennon and Ono in 1980]]\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=104}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.<ref name='MOMA'>{{cite web|title=Apple.

When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=683}} While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the ''[[Two Virgins]]'' album, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\".<ref>''[[Two Virgins]]'' liner notes</ref> When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\"{{sfn|Lennon|1978|p=183}} Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=510}} a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=800}}\n\nTwo years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"[[Bagism]]\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, where the Beatles had performed [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|their rooftop concert]] three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on [[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]].

Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"[[May Pang#\"Lost Weekend\"|lost weekend]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698\u2013699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]]. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\n===Sean Lennon===\n[[File:Sean Lennon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Sean Lennon at a [[Free Tibet]] event in 1998]]\nOno had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of [[househusband]], which he agreed to do.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=535, 690}}\n\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}\n\n===Former Beatles===\n{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd. All four are waving to the crowd.|Lennon (left) and the rest of the Beatles [[The Beatles#First visit to United States and British Invasion|arriving in New York City in 1964]]]]\n\nWhile Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}}}} Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him.{{sfn|The Editors of ''Rolling Stone''|2002|p=146}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', \"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission{{nbsp}}... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch{{nbsp}}... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934\u2013935}} According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}}... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}}... That ain't bad picking.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2010\u20132011|p=95}}\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, \"I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=82}}\n\n==Political activism==\n{{Further|Bed-In|Bagism}}\n\n[[File:Jlbedin3.JPG|thumb|alt=Lennon and Ono sit in front of flowers and placards bearing the word \"peace.\" Lennon is only partly visible, and he holds an acoustic guitar.

It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|p=252}} The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] in 1991.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=315}} The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}} In 1997, respecting President [[Bill Clinton]]'s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52\u201354, 76}}\n\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. ''Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files'' contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges\".{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=27}} The story is told in the documentary ''The US vs. John Lennon''. The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.{{sfn|The Associated Press|2006}}\n\n==Writing and art==\n<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->\n\nBeatles biographer [[Bill Harry]] wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179\u2013181}}\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories \"remarkable&nbsp;... also very funny&nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". ''Book Week'' reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393\u2013394}}\n\nIn combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write'', co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]]. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396\u2013397}} In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|group masturbation]], for [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s play ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net/LennonLoreLegacy/oh_calcutta.html|title=Oh!

''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\n\n==Musicianship==\n\n===Instruments played===\n{{Further|John Lennon's musical instruments|List of the Beatles' instruments}}\n\n[[File:John Lennon's Les Paul Jr..jpg|thumb|Lennon's [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Les Paul Jr.]]]]\n\nLennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger had left it on a bus.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=313}} The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=738\u2013740}}\n\nAs his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the [[Rickenbacker 325]], [[Epiphone Casino]] and [[Gibson J-160E]], and, from the start of his solo career, the [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]].{{sfn|Prown and Newquist|2003|p=213}}{{sfn|Lawrence|2009|p=27}} ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Appleford |title=Yoko Ono Discusses New John Lennon Documentary |work=Rolling Stone |date=6 August 2010 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614163611/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |archivedate=14 June 2017  }}</ref> Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the [[Fender Bass VI]], providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\", \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\", \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter\"]]) that occupied McCartney with another instrument.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=297}} His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \"Imagine\", described as his best-known solo work.{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=83}} His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\".{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=200}} In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a [[Mellotron]] keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in 1967.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\n===Vocal style===\nWhen the Beatles recorded \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", the final track during the mammoth one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\"{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=14}} In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\"{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=90}} The Beatles' producer, [[George Martin]], tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!{{nbsp}} ... put something on it{{nbsp}}... Make it ''different''.'\"{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=369\u2013370}} Martin obliged, often using [[double tracking|double-tracking]] and other techniques.\n\nAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of '[[Cold Turkey]]' and the cathartic ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''.\"{{sfn|Gregory|2007|p=75}} Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance{{nbsp}}... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically{{nbsp}}... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\"{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=143}} David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style.{{sfn|Ryan|1982|pp=118, 241}} Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\".{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=35}} Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' performance of \"[[This Boy]]\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak{{nbsp}}... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion.

They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having \"revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts\", the group then \"spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers\".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}} [[Liam Gallagher]] and his group [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero.

Shatrughna also appears as the 412th name of Vishnu in [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] of Mahabharata.\n \nAccording to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', Rama is the seventh avatar of [[Vishnu]] while [[Lakshmana]], Bharata and [[Shatrughna]] are considered as part-incarnations of [[Sheshanaga]], [[Sudarshan chakra]] and\n[[Shankha]] respectively.<ref name= Naidu>{{Cite book|last= Naidu |first= S.

Dasharatha's other two wives, [[Kaushalya]] and [[Kaikeyi]], had sons as well. Kaushalya had [[Rama]] and Kaikeyi had [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], who were Shatrughna's half-brothers. Shatrughna's twin brother was [[Lakshmana]]. Shatrughna was married to [[Shrutakirti]], daughter of [[Kushadhwaja]], [[Janaka]]'s younger brother. Thus, Shrutakirti was [[Sita]]'s cousin. They had two sons - [[Shatrughati]] and [[Subahu (Ramayana)| Subahu]].\n\n==Rama's exile==\n\n[[Image:Dasharatha four sons.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bharata and Shatrughna leave for Kaikeya, taking leave from Dasharatha, Rama and Lakshmana]]\n\nWhen Rama is exiled, Shatrughna drags Kaikeyi's old nurse [[Manthara]](who was responsible for poisoning the queen's mind against Rama) and makes an attack to kill her, but he is restrained by [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] who feels that Rama would not approve.\n\nBharata goes to Rama and asks him to come back to Ayodhya but Rama refuses. Bharata rules Ayodhya from Nandigramam and is an excellent leader, often referred to as the avatar of dharma. Though Bharata was the king designate of Ayodhya during Rama's exile, it was Shatrughna who took care of the administration of the whole kingdom, during Rama's absence. Shatrughna also was the only solace for the three Queen mothers during the absence of Rama, Lakshman and Bharata from Ayodhya.\n\n==Rebuked Manthara==\n\n[[File:Ravivarmapress_Rama_family.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rama]] with [[Sita]] on the throne, their children [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] on their laps. Behind the throne, [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] and Shatrughna stand. [[Hanuman]] bows to Rama before the throne. [[Valmiki]] to the left.]]\n\n[[Manthara]] appears only once in ''Ramayana'' after Rama's banishment. Having been rewarded by Kaikeyi with costly clothing and jewels, she is walking in the palace gardens when Bharata and his half-brother Shatrughna come upon her.

He is twin brother of [[Bharat]]. According to Valmiki Ramayana, Shatrughna is one half component of manifest Vishnu (Rama). Shatrughna also appears as the 412th name of Vishnu in [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] of Mahabharata.\n \nAccording to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', Rama is the seventh avatar of [[Vishnu]] while [[Lakshmana]], Bharata and [[Shatrughna]] are considered as part-incarnations of [[Sheshanaga]], [[Sudarshan chakra]] and\n[[Shankha]] respectively.<ref name= Naidu>{{Cite book|last= Naidu |first= S.

Dasharatha's other two wives, [[Kaushalya]] and [[Kaikeyi]], had sons as well. Kaushalya had [[Rama]] and Kaikeyi had [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], who were Shatrughna's half-brothers. Shatrughna's twin brother was [[Lakshmana]]. Shatrughna was married to [[Shrutakirti]], daughter of [[Kushadhwaja]], [[Janaka]]'s younger brother. Thus, Shrutakirti was [[Sita]]'s cousin. They had two sons - [[Shatrughati]] and [[Subahu (Ramayana)| Subahu]].\n\n==Rama's exile==\n\n[[Image:Dasharatha four sons.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bharata and Shatrughna leave for Kaikeya, taking leave from Dasharatha, Rama and Lakshmana]]\n\nWhen Rama is exiled, Shatrughna drags Kaikeyi's old nurse [[Manthara]](who was responsible for poisoning the queen's mind against Rama) and makes an attack to kill her, but he is restrained by [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] who feels that Rama would not approve.\n\nBharata goes to Rama and asks him to come back to Ayodhya but Rama refuses. Bharata rules Ayodhya from Nandigramam and is an excellent leader, often referred to as the avatar of dharma. Though Bharata was the king designate of Ayodhya during Rama's exile, it was Shatrughna who took care of the administration of the whole kingdom, during Rama's absence. Shatrughna also was the only solace for the three Queen mothers during the absence of Rama, Lakshman and Bharata from Ayodhya.\n\n==Rebuked Manthara==\n\n[[File:Ravivarmapress_Rama_family.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rama]] with [[Sita]] on the throne, their children [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] on their laps.

[[Valmiki]] to the left.]]\n\n[[Manthara]] appears only once in ''Ramayana'' after Rama's banishment. Having been rewarded by Kaikeyi with costly clothing and jewels, she is walking in the palace gardens when Bharata and his half-brother Shatrughna come upon her. Seeing her, Shatrughna flies into a violent rage over Rama's banishment and assaults her murderously. Kaikeyi begs Bharata to save her, which he does, telling Shatrughna that it is a sin to kill a woman and that Rama would be furious with them both if he does such a thing.

It was first released on 3 May 1993 in the United Kingdom by [[London Records]] and on 11 May 1993 in the United States by [[Qwest Records|Qwest]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It was the band's first album following the demise of their former label [[Factory Records]], and would be their last studio album for eight years until 2001's ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''.\n\n''Republic'' became New Order's second consecutive album to top the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was nominated for the 1993 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. In the United States, it reached number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the band's highest-peaking album on the chart to date. Its lead single \"[[Regret (New Order song)|Regret]]\" became New Order's last top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The band went on hiatus following a gig at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] in promotion of the album in August 1993. Lead singer [[Bernard Sumner]] was known to not like travelling to North America, and media reports suggested that the pressure of the long leg there contributed to the band's temporary demise, although they reunited in 1998.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe album follows on the standard New Order principles of not having anything other than the credits and art inside the CD sleeve, and of having a [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]]-designed cover. The sleeve itself is a reference to the US, and in particular, California, where Saville had relocated. The sleeve displays different aspects of California\u2014people relaxing on the beach, while some people's houses are being burnt down (a reference to frequent wildfires experienced in the state or perhaps to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]); vast natural landscapes, contrasting to the skyline of Los Angeles, etc.  Most images were taken from [[Stock photography|stock photo]] libraries to achieve a commercial look, and were heavily retouched. Several of these images have also been used in marketing, e.g., direct mailing, catalogues, and adverts for businesses. Another interpretation of the album's artwork alludes to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New Order |url=http://www.worldinmotion.net/neworder/discography/albums/1993/republic.htm |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Republic: The Limited Run..''===\nA limited-edition version of ''Republic'', titled ''Republic: The Limited Run..'', was released in the United States. Although the tracks are the same as the standard release, the packaging is entirely different. Instead of a jewel case, the CD comes in a folding wallet made of bright orange vinyl underpadded with soft foam, giving it the feel of an [[Swim ring|inner tube]].

It was first released on 3 May 1993 in the United Kingdom by [[London Records]] and on 11 May 1993 in the United States by [[Qwest Records|Qwest]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It was the band's first album following the demise of their former label [[Factory Records]], and would be their last studio album for eight years until 2001's ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''.\n\n''Republic'' became New Order's second consecutive album to top the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was nominated for the 1993 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. In the United States, it reached number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the band's highest-peaking album on the chart to date. Its lead single \"[[Regret (New Order song)|Regret]]\" became New Order's last top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The band went on hiatus following a gig at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] in promotion of the album in August 1993. Lead singer [[Bernard Sumner]] was known to not like travelling to North America, and media reports suggested that the pressure of the long leg there contributed to the band's temporary demise, although they reunited in 1998.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe album follows on the standard New Order principles of not having anything other than the credits and art inside the CD sleeve, and of having a [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]]-designed cover. The sleeve itself is a reference to the US, and in particular, California, where Saville had relocated. The sleeve displays different aspects of California\u2014people relaxing on the beach, while some people's houses are being burnt down (a reference to frequent wildfires experienced in the state or perhaps to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]); vast natural landscapes, contrasting to the skyline of Los Angeles, etc.  Most images were taken from [[Stock photography|stock photo]] libraries to achieve a commercial look, and were heavily retouched. Several of these images have also been used in marketing, e.g., direct mailing, catalogues, and adverts for businesses. Another interpretation of the album's artwork alludes to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New Order |url=http://www.worldinmotion.net/neworder/discography/albums/1993/republic.htm |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Republic: The Limited Run..''===\nA limited-edition version of ''Republic'', titled ''Republic: The Limited Run..'', was released in the United States. Although the tracks are the same as the standard release, the packaging is entirely different. Instead of a jewel case, the CD comes in a folding wallet made of bright orange vinyl underpadded with soft foam, giving it the feel of an [[Swim ring|inner tube]]. The CD's label is also redesigned, with no words but with a picture of several orange rubber inner tubes against a background of flames, a reference to the cover artwork.

At the end of the season, Miles's wife Channing phones to say she will abort their unborn baby, Sable kidnaps Monica's son, Francesca seemingly dies after a car crash involving herself and Philip, and Fallon, stranded in the desert, is seemingly abducted by aliens in the finale.<ref name=\"Pressreader Colbys\"/> The series' most infamous [[cliffhanger]] proved to be its last when the series was subsequently cancelled.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{further|List of The Colbys episodes}}\n{{:List of The Colbys episodes}}\n\n==Development and casting==\nIn early 1985, news outlets began reporting that ABC was developing a spin-off of ''Dynasty'', then the #1 rated show in the US.<ref name=\"Spokane\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yQNMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mfkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7029,59510|work=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|title=ABC is looking to broaden ''Dynasty'' reign|first=Rick|last=Sherwood|date=January 16, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"EI\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19850225&id=ccJaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W1kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5060,2173180&hl=fr|work=[[Evening Independent]]|title=''Dynasty'' spinoff to rival ''Dallas''|date=February 23, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> ''Dynasty'' actors [[Rock Hudson]], [[Ali Macgraw]], [[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]], [[Heather Locklear]], and [[John James (actor)|John James]] were mentioned as potential stars of the new series, tentatively titled ''The Colbys'',<ref name=\"Spokane\"/><ref name=\"EI\"/> and ABC was purportedly wooing [[Pamela Sue Martin]] to reprise her role as Fallon Carrington.<ref name=\"EI\"/> It was also reported that ''Dynasty'' stars [[John Forsythe]], [[Linda Evans]], [[Joan Collins]], and guest star [[Elizabeth Taylor]] would appear in the first two episodes of the spin-off, which would initially air after ''Dynasty'' on Wednesdays but would move to a time slot opposite ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' on Fridays.<ref name=\"EI\"/> In March 1985, ABC announced that its rumored ''Dynasty'' spin-off had been greenlighted, to debut the following season.<ref name=\"TimesDaily Colbys\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19850320&id=OGEeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3484,4929970&hl=fr|work=[[TimesDaily]]|title=ABC Finally makes ''Dynasty'' spin-off official|first=Rick|last=Sherwood|date=March 20, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> ''The Colbys'' would star John James as his ''Dynasty'' character Jeff Colby, with ''General Hospital'' actress Emma Samms as Fallon Carrington.<ref name=\"TimesDaily Colbys\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=_REEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22emma+samms%22+%22dynasty%22+%22shapiro%22%22&source=bl&ots=ZhSBAM7Q7z&sig=dkwrGQjqVNOTK2Pia8RbPrb-5jA&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin98K31prMAhXLXhoKHSEPD38Q6AEISzAL#v=onepage&q=%22emma+samms%22+%22dynasty%22+%22shapiro%22%22&f=false|work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]|title=Emma Samms: From Daytime Soaps to ''Dynasty''|date=January 9, 1986|publisher=Emmis Communications|via=Google Books|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"1985 schedule\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19850509&id=OK1NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0vsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1928,4090707&hl=fr|work=[[The Ledger|Lakeland Ledger]]|title=ABC going all out in fall to recoup ratings losses|first=Fred|last=Rothenberg|date=May 9, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> In May 1985, ABC unveiled its fall 1985 schedule, which placed ''The Colbys'' into the Thursday 9 pm time slot, preceded by ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and followed by ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]''.<ref name=\"1985 schedule\"/>\n\nIn June 1985, ''Dynasty'' co-creator [[Esther Shapiro]] approached [[Charlton Heston]] about the role of patriarch Jason Colby, the brother of ''Dynasty''{{'s}} [[Cecil Colby]] ([[Lloyd Bochner]]).<ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19850901&id=qbwzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=au8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5789,617526&hl=fr|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|title=Run for the United States Senate?

At the end of the season, Miles's wife Channing phones to say she will abort their unborn baby, Sable kidnaps Monica's son, Francesca seemingly dies after a car crash involving herself and Philip, and Fallon, stranded in the desert, is seemingly abducted by aliens in the finale.<ref name=\"Pressreader Colbys\"/> The series' most infamous [[cliffhanger]] proved to be its last when the series was subsequently cancelled.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{further|List of The Colbys episodes}}\n{{:List of The Colbys episodes}}\n\n==Development and casting==\nIn early 1985, news outlets began reporting that ABC was developing a spin-off of ''Dynasty'', then the #1 rated show in the US.<ref name=\"Spokane\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yQNMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mfkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7029,59510|work=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|title=ABC is looking to broaden ''Dynasty'' reign|first=Rick|last=Sherwood|date=January 16, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"EI\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19850225&id=ccJaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W1kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5060,2173180&hl=fr|work=[[Evening Independent]]|title=''Dynasty'' spinoff to rival ''Dallas''|date=February 23, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> ''Dynasty'' actors [[Rock Hudson]], [[Ali Macgraw]], [[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]], [[Heather Locklear]], and [[John James (actor)|John James]] were mentioned as potential stars of the new series, tentatively titled ''The Colbys'',<ref name=\"Spokane\"/><ref name=\"EI\"/> and ABC was purportedly wooing [[Pamela Sue Martin]] to reprise her role as Fallon Carrington.<ref name=\"EI\"/> It was also reported that ''Dynasty'' stars [[John Forsythe]], [[Linda Evans]], [[Joan Collins]], and guest star [[Elizabeth Taylor]] would appear in the first two episodes of the spin-off, which would initially air after ''Dynasty'' on Wednesdays but would move to a time slot opposite ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' on Fridays.<ref name=\"EI\"/> In March 1985, ABC announced that its rumored ''Dynasty'' spin-off had been greenlighted, to debut the following season.<ref name=\"TimesDaily Colbys\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19850320&id=OGEeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3484,4929970&hl=fr|work=[[TimesDaily]]|title=ABC Finally makes ''Dynasty'' spin-off official|first=Rick|last=Sherwood|date=March 20, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> ''The Colbys'' would star John James as his ''Dynasty'' character Jeff Colby, with ''General Hospital'' actress Emma Samms as Fallon Carrington.<ref name=\"TimesDaily Colbys\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=_REEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22emma+samms%22+%22dynasty%22+%22shapiro%22%22&source=bl&ots=ZhSBAM7Q7z&sig=dkwrGQjqVNOTK2Pia8RbPrb-5jA&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin98K31prMAhXLXhoKHSEPD38Q6AEISzAL#v=onepage&q=%22emma+samms%22+%22dynasty%22+%22shapiro%22%22&f=false|work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]|title=Emma Samms: From Daytime Soaps to ''Dynasty''|date=January 9, 1986|publisher=Emmis Communications|via=Google Books|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"1985 schedule\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19850509&id=OK1NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0vsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1928,4090707&hl=fr|work=[[The Ledger|Lakeland Ledger]]|title=ABC going all out in fall to recoup ratings losses|first=Fred|last=Rothenberg|date=May 9, 1985|via=news.google.com|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> In May 1985, ABC unveiled its fall 1985 schedule, which placed ''The Colbys'' into the Thursday 9 pm time slot, preceded by ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and followed by ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]''.<ref name=\"1985 schedule\"/>\n\nIn June 1985, ''Dynasty'' co-creator [[Esther Shapiro]] approached [[Charlton Heston]] about the role of patriarch Jason Colby, the brother of ''Dynasty''{{'s}} [[Cecil Colby]] ([[Lloyd Bochner]]).<ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19850901&id=qbwzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=au8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5789,617526&hl=fr|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|title=Run for the United States Senate?

Miles (who refers to Jeff as his half-brother, leading to the assumption that Jason was his and Monica's father after all) later appears in the miniseries ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]'' (1991), reunited with Fallon, and participates in Jeff's rescue from the Consortium.

The window decoration is either drawn by the [[window manager]] (X11) or by the client ([[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]]). The drawing of the content is the task of the client.]]\n\nIn [[graphical user interface]]s, the '''window decoration''' is a part of a [[window (computing)|window]] in  most [[windowing system]]s.\n\nA windows decoration typically consists of a [[title bar]], usually along the top of each window and a minimal border around the other three sides.<ref>http://markhobley.yi.org/glossary/windowdecorations.html</ref> On Microsoft Windows this is called \"nonclient area\".<ref>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162743.aspx</ref>\n\nIn the predominant layout for modern window decorations, the top bar contains the title of that window and buttons which perform windowing-related actions such as:\n* Close\n* Maximize\n* Minimize\n* Resize\n* Roll-up\n\nThe border exists primarily to allow the user to resize the window, but also to create a visual separation between the window's contents and the rest of the [[desktop environment]].\n\nWindow decorations are considered important for the design of the [[look and feel]] of an [[operating system]] and some systems allow for customization of the colors, styles and animation effects used.\n\n== Elements of window decoration ==\n=== Window border ===\n{{Section expand|date=January 2015}}\n\n'''Window border''' is a window decoration component provided by some window managers, that appears around the [[active window]]. Some window managers may also display a border around [[background window]]s. Typically window borders can be used to provide [[window motion]] enabling the window to be moved or resized by using a [[dragging|drag]] action. Some [[window manager]]s provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no [[window motion]] facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.\n\n=== Title bar ===\n[[File:Titlebar.png|thumb|A title bar of [[GNOME Calculator]]]]\n\n'''Title bar''' is a [[graphical control element]] and part of the window decoration. provided by some [[window manager]]s. As a convention it is located at the top of the [[window (computing)|window]] as a horizontal bar. The title bar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows. Typically [[titlebar]]s can be used to provide [[window motion]] enabling the window to be moved around the screen by using a drag action. Some [[window manager]]s{{which|date=January 2016}} provide titlebars which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no [[window motion]] facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar.\n\nDefault title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the [[hostname|host]] running the application also appears frequently. Various methods ([[menu (computing)|menu]]-selections, [[escape sequences]], setup parameters, [[Command-line interface|command-line]] options \u2013 depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the [[end-user]] some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a [[text editor]] may display the [[filename]] or [[path (computing)|path]] of the document being edited. Most [[web browser]]s will [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the contents of the [[HTML element]] <code>title</code> in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the application name. [[Google Chrome]] and some versions of [[Mozilla Firefox]] place their [[tabbed browsing|tabs]] in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated.\n\nThe title bar often contains [[widget (computing)|widget]]s for system commands relating to the window, such as a ''maximize'', ''minimize'', ''rollup'' and ''close'' buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a [[clock]], etc.\n\nIn many [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] interfaces, the user may move a window by [[Point-and-click|grab]]bing the title bar and [[dragging]].\n\n==== Titlebar buttons ====\nSome [[window manager]]s provide titlebar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.\n\nThe following buttons may appear in the titlebar:\n* close\n* maximize\n* minimize\n* resize\n* roll-up (or [[WindowShade]])\n\nNote that a [[context menu]] may be available from some titlebar buttons or by right-clicking.\n\n==== Titlebar icon ====\nSome [[window manager]]s display a small icon in the titlebar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a [[context menu]] facility. OS X applications commonly have a proxy [[icon (computing)|icon]] next to the window title that functions the same as the document's icon in the file manager.\n\n==== Document status icon ====\nSome window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: [[Mac OS X]] displays a dot in the center of its close button; [[RISC OS]] appends an [[asterisk]] to the title.\n\n==== Tiling window managers ====\nSome [[tiling window manager]]s provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These [[window manager]]s do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action on the titlebar and may also serve the purpose of a [[status line]] from stacking window managers.\n\n==== In popular operating systems ====\n\n{| style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The drawing of the content is the task of the client.]]\n\nIn [[graphical user interface]]s, the '''window decoration''' is a part of a [[window (computing)|window]] in  most [[windowing system]]s.\n\nA windows decoration typically consists of a [[title bar]], usually along the top of each window and a minimal border around the other three sides.<ref>http://markhobley.yi.org/glossary/windowdecorations.html</ref> On Microsoft Windows this is called \"nonclient area\".<ref>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162743.aspx</ref>\n\nIn the predominant layout for modern window decorations, the top bar contains the title of that window and buttons which perform windowing-related actions such as:\n* Close\n* Maximize\n* Minimize\n* Resize\n* Roll-up\n\nThe border exists primarily to allow the user to resize the window, but also to create a visual separation between the window's contents and the rest of the [[desktop environment]].\n\nWindow decorations are considered important for the design of the [[look and feel]] of an [[operating system]] and some systems allow for customization of the colors, styles and animation effects used.\n\n== Elements of window decoration ==\n=== Window border ===\n{{Section expand|date=January 2015}}\n\n'''Window border''' is a window decoration component provided by some window managers, that appears around the [[active window]]. Some window managers may also display a border around [[background window]]s. Typically window borders can be used to provide [[window motion]] enabling the window to be moved or resized by using a [[dragging|drag]] action. Some [[window manager]]s provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no [[window motion]] facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.\n\n=== Title bar ===\n[[File:Titlebar.png|thumb|A title bar of [[GNOME Calculator]]]]\n\n'''Title bar''' is a [[graphical control element]] and part of the window decoration. provided by some [[window manager]]s. As a convention it is located at the top of the [[window (computing)|window]] as a horizontal bar. The title bar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows. Typically [[titlebar]]s can be used to provide [[window motion]] enabling the window to be moved around the screen by using a drag action. Some [[window manager]]s{{which|date=January 2016}} provide titlebars which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no [[window motion]] facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar.\n\nDefault title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the [[hostname|host]] running the application also appears frequently. Various methods ([[menu (computing)|menu]]-selections, [[escape sequences]], setup parameters, [[Command-line interface|command-line]] options \u2013 depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the [[end-user]] some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a [[text editor]] may display the [[filename]] or [[path (computing)|path]] of the document being edited. Most [[web browser]]s will [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the contents of the [[HTML element]] <code>title</code> in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the application name. [[Google Chrome]] and some versions of [[Mozilla Firefox]] place their [[tabbed browsing|tabs]] in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated.\n\nThe title bar often contains [[widget (computing)|widget]]s for system commands relating to the window, such as a ''maximize'', ''minimize'', ''rollup'' and ''close'' buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a [[clock]], etc.\n\nIn many [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] interfaces, the user may move a window by [[Point-and-click|grab]]bing the title bar and [[dragging]].\n\n==== Titlebar buttons ====\nSome [[window manager]]s provide titlebar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.\n\nThe following buttons may appear in the titlebar:\n* close\n* maximize\n* minimize\n* resize\n* roll-up (or [[WindowShade]])\n\nNote that a [[context menu]] may be available from some titlebar buttons or by right-clicking.\n\n==== Titlebar icon ====\nSome [[window manager]]s display a small icon in the titlebar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a [[context menu]] facility. OS X applications commonly have a proxy [[icon (computing)|icon]] next to the window title that functions the same as the document's icon in the file manager.\n\n==== Document status icon ====\nSome window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: [[Mac OS X]] displays a dot in the center of its close button; [[RISC OS]] appends an [[asterisk]] to the title.\n\n==== Tiling window managers ====\nSome [[tiling window manager]]s provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These [[window manager]]s do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action on the titlebar and may also serve the purpose of a [[status line]] from stacking window managers.\n\n==== In popular operating systems ====\n\n{| style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!
