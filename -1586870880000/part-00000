Dr. Fabian Leendertz, an epidemiologist who was part of the investigative team, said Ebola virus is transmitted to humans either through contact with larger wildlife or by direct contact with bats.

Previous Ebola outbreaks have occurred in remote areas making containment easier; the current outbreak struck in an area that lies at the centre of both a highly-mobile and densely populated region which has made tracking more difficult:  \"This time, the virus is traveling effortlessly across borders by plane, car and foot, shifting from forests to cities and springing up in clusters far from any previously known infections. Border closures, flight bans and mass quarantines have been ineffective.\"  [[Peter Piot]], who co-discovered Ebola, said Ebola \"isn't striking in a 'linear fashion' this time. It's hopping around, especially in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/09/08/ebola-resurgence-in-guinea-liberia-highlights-west-africas-containment-concerns|title=Ebola Resurgence in Guinea, Liberia Highlights West Africa's Containment Concerns \u2013 US News|author=Andrew Soergel|work=US News & World Report}}</ref>\n\n===Fear of healthcare workers and clinics===\n[[File:Preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit (3).jpg|thumb|250px|M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res staff dressed in protective clothing]]\n\nContainment has also been difficult due to fear of healthcare workers.  Infected people and those that they have been in contact with  have evaded surveillance, moving at will and hiding their illnesses while they infect others in turn. Entire villages, stricken by fear, have closed themselves off, giving the disease an opportunity to strike in another area.  It has been reported that  in some areas it is believed that health workers are purposely spreading the disease to the people, while others believe that the disease does not exist. Riots broke out in the regional capital, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, when rumors were spread that people were being contaminated when health workers were spraying a market area to decontaminate it.<ref name=\"Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443 |title=Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed |publisher=BBC News |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May, the number of Ebola cases appeared to be decreasing and [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] (MSF) closed a treatment facility in the Macenta region because the outbreak of Ebola there appeared to have been resolved.  At the time it was thought that the new cases were caused by people returning from Liberia or from Sierra Leone, however it was later suggested that villagers had become fearful and were hiding cases rather than reporting them.  Seeing workers wearing the required protection outfits worn by health workers and taking those suspected of having Ebola or of being contacts to the treatment center (perhaps never to be seen again), refusing the usual burial rituals when a patient died, and other actions taken by the unfamiliar individuals that had come to their remote areas, had led to rumors of organ harvesting and government and tribal plots.

Previous Ebola outbreaks have occurred in remote areas making containment easier; the current outbreak struck in an area that lies at the centre of both a highly-mobile and densely populated region which has made tracking more difficult:  \"This time, the virus is traveling effortlessly across borders by plane, car and foot, shifting from forests to cities and springing up in clusters far from any previously known infections. Border closures, flight bans and mass quarantines have been ineffective.\"  [[Peter Piot]], who co-discovered Ebola, said Ebola \"isn't striking in a 'linear fashion' this time. It's hopping around, especially in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/09/08/ebola-resurgence-in-guinea-liberia-highlights-west-africas-containment-concerns|title=Ebola Resurgence in Guinea, Liberia Highlights West Africa's Containment Concerns \u2013 US News|author=Andrew Soergel|work=US News & World Report}}</ref>\n\n===Fear of healthcare workers and clinics===\n[[File:Preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit (3).jpg|thumb|250px|M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res staff dressed in protective clothing]]\n\nContainment has also been difficult due to fear of healthcare workers.  Infected people and those that they have been in contact with  have evaded surveillance, moving at will and hiding their illnesses while they infect others in turn. Entire villages, stricken by fear, have closed themselves off, giving the disease an opportunity to strike in another area.  It has been reported that  in some areas it is believed that health workers are purposely spreading the disease to the people, while others believe that the disease does not exist. Riots broke out in the regional capital, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, when rumors were spread that people were being contaminated when health workers were spraying a market area to decontaminate it.<ref name=\"Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443 |title=Guinea Outbreak: Guinea Health Team Killed |publisher=BBC News |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May, the number of Ebola cases appeared to be decreasing and [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] (MSF) closed a treatment facility in the Macenta region because the outbreak of Ebola there appeared to have been resolved.  At the time it was thought that the new cases were caused by people returning from Liberia or from Sierra Leone, however it was later suggested that villagers had become fearful and were hiding cases rather than reporting them.  Seeing workers wearing the required protection outfits worn by health workers and taking those suspected of having Ebola or of being contacts to the treatment center (perhaps never to be seen again), refusing the usual burial rituals when a patient died, and other actions taken by the unfamiliar individuals that had come to their remote areas, had led to rumors of organ harvesting and government and tribal plots.
