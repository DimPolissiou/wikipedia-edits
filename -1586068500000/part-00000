In the ballad, Hua Mulan, disguised as a man, takes her aged father's place in the army. Mulan fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown. \n\nThe historic setting of ''Ballad of Mulan'' is in the [[Northern Wei]]. Over a thousand years later, [[Xu Wei]]'s play from the [[Ming dynasty]] places her in the Northern Wei, whereas the [[Qing dynasty]] ''Sui Tang Romance'' has her active around the founding of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] c. 620. In 621, the founder of the Tang dynasty emerged victorious over [[Wang Shichong]] and [[Dou Jiande]]. The latter sired Dou Xianniang, another female warrior who became Mulan's [[laotong]] in the ''Sui Tang Romance''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|p=12n}}</ref>\n\nThe Hua Mulan crater on [[Venus]] is named after her.<ref>{{Cite journal | authors = Russell, Joel F., Schaber, Gerald G. | title = Named Venusian craters | journal = In Lunar and Planetary Inst., Twenty-Fourth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | date = March 1993 | bibcode = 1993LPI....24.1219R}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/vc/vcinfo/?refnum=269|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute of the [[Universities Space Research Association]]|title=Venus Crater Database|accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mulan, 18th century, ink and colors on silk.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Hua Mulan, 18th century, housed in the British Museum]]\nThe ''Ballad of Mulan'' was first transcribed in the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' ({{zh|c=\u53e4\u4eca\u6a02\u9304|p=G\u01d4j\u012bn Yu\u00e8l\u00f9}}) in the 6th century. The earliest extant text of the poem comes from an 11th- or 12th-century anthology known as the ''[[Music Bureau]] Collection'' ({{zh|c=\u6a02\u5e9c\u8a69|p=Yu\u00e8f\u01d4sh\u012b}}). Its author, [[Guo Maoqian]], explicitly mentions the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' as his source for the poem. As a [[ballad]], the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 [[couplet]]s, and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.\n\nIn the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], playwright [[Xu Wei]] (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as \"The Female Mulan\" ({{lang|zh|\u96cc\u6728\u862d|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n}} or, more fully, \"The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father's Place\" ({{zh|c=\u96cc\u6728\u862d\u66ff\u7236\u5f9e\u8ecd|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n T\u00ec F\u00f9 C\u00f3ngj\u016bn}}), in two acts.\n\nLater, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the ''{{ill2|Sui-Tang Romance|zh|\u968b\u5510\u6f14\u7fa9}}'', a historical novel written by {{ill2|Chu Renhuo|zh|\u891a\u4eba\u7372}} in the 17th century, early in the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|pp=xx\u2013xxi, 119\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"huang-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Huang|2006|pp=120,124\u20135}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the story of Hua Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people on the same level as the [[Butterfly Lovers]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Name===\nIn Chinese, ''m\u00f9l\u00e1n'' refers to the [[Magnolia liliiflora|magnolia]]. The heroine of the poem is given different family names in different versions of her story. According to ''[[History of Ming]]'', her family name is [[Zhu (surname)|Zhu]] (\u6731), while the ''[[Draft History of Qing|History of Qing]]'' says it is [[Wei (surname)|Wei]] (\u9b4f).

The poem starts with Mulan sitting worriedly at her loom, as one male from each family is called to serve in the army to defend the [[Tuoba]] realm from [[Rouran]] invaders. Her father is old and weak, and her younger brother is just a child, so she decides to take his place and bids farewell to her parents, who support her. She is already skilled in fighting, having been taught martial arts, sword fighting, and archery by the time she enlists in the army. After twelve years of fighting, the army returns and the warriors are rewarded. Mulan turns down an official post, and asks only for a camel to carry her home. She is greeted with joy by her family. Mulan dons her old clothes and meets her comrades, who are shocked that in the 12 years of their enlistment together, they did not realize that she was a woman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2826859|title=The Legendary Warrior that Inspired Disney's Mulan Is Pretty Badass|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211233838/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2826859|archive-date=2016-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===''Sui Tang Romance''===\nChu Renhuo's ''Romance of the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]]'' (c. 1675; first edition 1695) provides additional backdrops and plot-twists.<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\"/> Chu placed Mulan under the rule of [[Heshana Khan]] (603\u2013619) of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].

Mulan dresses as a man and enlists in her father's stead. She is intercepted by the forces of the Xia king [[Dou Jiande]] (573\u2013621) and is brought under questioning by the king's warrior daughter Xianniang ({{zh|c=\u7dda\u5a18}}), who tries to recruit Mulan as a man.

In the ballad, Hua Mulan, disguised as a man, takes her aged father's place in the army. Mulan fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown. \n\nThe historic setting of ''Ballad of Mulan'' is in the [[Northern Wei]]. Over a thousand years later, [[Xu Wei]]'s play from the [[Ming dynasty]] places her in the Northern Wei, whereas the [[Qing dynasty]] ''Sui Tang Romance'' has her active around the founding of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] c. 620. In 621, the founder of the Tang dynasty emerged victorious over [[Wang Shichong]] and [[Dou Jiande]]. The latter sired Dou Xianniang, another female warrior who became Mulan's [[laotong]] in the ''Sui Tang Romance''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|p=12n}}</ref>\n\nThe Hua Mulan crater on [[Venus]] is named after her.<ref>{{Cite journal | authors = Russell, Joel F., Schaber, Gerald G. | title = Named Venusian craters | journal = In Lunar and Planetary Inst., Twenty-Fourth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | date = March 1993 | bibcode = 1993LPI....24.1219R}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/vc/vcinfo/?refnum=269|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute of the [[Universities Space Research Association]]|title=Venus Crater Database|accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mulan, 18th century, ink and colors on silk.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Hua Mulan, 18th century, housed in the British Museum]]\nThe ''Ballad of Mulan'' was first transcribed in the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' ({{zh|c=\u53e4\u4eca\u6a02\u9304|p=G\u01d4j\u012bn Yu\u00e8l\u00f9}}) in the 6th century. The earliest extant text of the poem comes from an 11th- or 12th-century anthology known as the ''[[Music Bureau]] Collection'' ({{zh|c=\u6a02\u5e9c\u8a69|p=Yu\u00e8f\u01d4sh\u012b}}). Its author, [[Guo Maoqian]], explicitly mentions the ''Musical Records of Old and New'' as his source for the poem. As a [[ballad]], the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 [[couplet]]s, and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.\n\nIn the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], playwright [[Xu Wei]] (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as \"The Female Mulan\" ({{lang|zh|\u96cc\u6728\u862d|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n}} or, more fully, \"The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father's Place\" ({{zh|c=\u96cc\u6728\u862d\u66ff\u7236\u5f9e\u8ecd|p=C\u00ed-M\u00f9l\u00e1n T\u00ec F\u00f9 C\u00f3ngj\u016bn}}), in two acts.\n\nLater, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the ''{{ill2|Sui-Tang Romance|zh|\u968b\u5510\u6f14\u7fa9}}'', a historical novel written by {{ill2|Chu Renhuo|zh|\u891a\u4eba\u7372}} in the 17th century, early in the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Kwa|Idema|2010|pp=xx\u2013xxi, 119\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"huang-SuiTang\">{{Harvnb|Huang|2006|pp=120,124\u20135}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the story of Hua Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people on the same level as the [[Butterfly Lovers]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Name===\nIn Chinese, ''m\u00f9l\u00e1n'' refers to the [[Magnolia liliiflora|magnolia]].

The poem starts with Mulan sitting worriedly at her loom, as one male from each family is called to serve in the army to defend the [[Tuoba]] realm from [[Rouran]] invaders. Her father is old and weak, and her younger brother is just a child, so she decides to take his place and bids farewell to her parents, who support her. She is already skilled in fighting, having been taught martial arts, sword fighting, and archery by the time she enlists in the army. After twelve years of fighting, the army returns and the warriors are rewarded. Mulan turns down an official post, and asks only for a camel to carry her home. She is greeted with joy by her family. Mulan dons her old clothes and meets her comrades, who are shocked that in the 12 years of their enlistment together, they did not realize that she was a woman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2826859|title=The Legendary Warrior that Inspired Disney's Mulan Is Pretty Badass|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211233838/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2826859|archive-date=2016-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===''Sui Tang Romance''===\nChu Renhuo's ''Romance of the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]]'' (c. 1675; first edition 1695) provides additional backdrops and plot-twists.<ref name=\"Mulan5-SuiTang\"/> Chu placed Mulan under the rule of [[Heshana Khan]] (603\u2013619) of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].

{"title_page": "History of Poland", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{History of Poland}}\nThe '''history of [[Poland]]''' ({{lang-pl|Historia Polski}}) represents over 1,000 years of recorded historical events as well as 500,000 years of human activity on Polish soil. An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287\u2013311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287\u2013311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]] along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system on central Polish lands. At the time when most Poles realized the futility of armed resistance without external support, the various sections of Polish society were undergoing deep and far-reaching evolution in the areas of social, economic and cultural development.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\"/><ref name=\"Gierowski 311\u2013318\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=311\u2013318}}.</ref>\n\n===Formation of modern Polish society under foreign rule (1864\u20131914)===\n\n====Repression and organic work====\n\n[[File:Prus 002.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] (1847\u20131912), a leading novelist, journalist and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Positivism|philosopher]] of Poland's [[Positivism in Poland|Positivism movement]]]]\n\nThe failure of the January Uprising in Poland caused a major psychological trauma and became a historic watershed; indeed, it sparked the development of modern [[Polish nationalism]]. The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (an [[academy of sciences]]) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/>\n\nSocial activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\n[[Positivism in Poland]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182\u2013187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192\u2013194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192\u2013194}}.</ref> It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European [[nationalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=297\u2013298}}.</ref>\n\n====Economic development and social change====\n\n[[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|right|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most remained to form a large [[Minority group|ethnic minority]]]]\n\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale [[industrialisation]], were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187\u2013192, 199}}.</ref> The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=294}}.</ref> Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various [[ethnic group]]s worked or settled in Europe and in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nSocial and economic changes were partial and gradual. The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition. Ethnically Polish settlement spread over a large area further to the east, including its greatest concentration in the [[Vilnius Region]], amounted to only over 20% of that number.<ref name=\"Lukowski 208\u2013216\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=208\u2013216}}.</ref>\n \nPolish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the [[Union of Active Struggle]], were formed in 1908\u20131914, mainly in Galicia.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915. In the [[Act of 5th November]] 1916, a fresh incarnation of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]] (''Kr\u00f3lestwo Regencyjne'') was proclaimed by Germany and Austria on formerly Russian-controlled territories,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> within the German ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' scheme.

This increasingly autonomous puppet state existed until November 1918, when it was replaced by the newly established [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The existence of this \"kingdom\" and its planned Polish army had a positive effect on the Polish national efforts on the [[Triple Entente|Allied side]], but in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of March 1918 the victorious in the east [[German Empire|Germany]] imposed harsh conditions on defeated Russia and ignored Polish interests.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\"/><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\"/><ref name=\"Versailles\">{{Harvnb|Henig|2011}}.</ref> Toward the end of the war, the German authorities engaged in massive, purposeful devastation of industrial and other economic potential of Polish lands in order to impoverish the country, a likely future competitor of Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=276}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish Regents 1916.jpg|thumb|left|The Regency Council of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1918.

There was also a 30,000-men strong Polish anti-German army in Russia. Dmowski, operating from Paris as head of the [[Polish National Committee (1917\u201319)|Polish National Committee]] (KNP), became the spokesman for Polish nationalism in the Allied camp.

In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939.

An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

The [[Greater Poland uprising (1846)|Greater Poland uprising]] ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the [[Krak\u00f3w uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow]] into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the [[Galician slaughter]] of 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> a large-scale rebellion of [[serfdom|serf]]s seeking relief from their post-feudal condition of [[Serfdom in Poland|mandatory labor]] as practiced in ''[[folwark]]s''. The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to the [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|abolition of Polish serfdom]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1848. A new wave of Polish involvement in revolutionary movements soon took place in the partitions and in other parts of Europe in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions of 1848 (e.g. [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]'s participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]]). The 1848 [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|German revolutions]] precipitated the [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|Greater Poland uprising of 1848]],<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> in which peasants in the Prussian Partition, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.<ref name=\"Gierowski 232\u2013287\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=232\u2013287}}.</ref>\n\n====The Uprising of January 1863====\n\n[[File:Romuald Traugutt 111.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]]]\n\nAs a matter of continuous policy, the Russian autocracy kept assailing Polish national core values of language, religion and culture.<ref name=\"Burant 131\u2013156\">{{Harvnb|Burant|1985|pp=131\u2013156}}.</ref> In consequence, despite the limited liberalization measures allowed in [[Congress Poland]] under the rule of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], a renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860\u20131861. During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287\u2013311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287\u2013311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]] along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (an [[academy of sciences]]) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/>\n\nSocial activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\n[[Positivism in Poland]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182\u2013187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192\u2013194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192\u2013194}}.</ref> It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European [[nationalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=297\u2013298}}.</ref>\n\n====Economic development and social change====\n\n[[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|right|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most remained to form a large [[Minority group|ethnic minority]]]]\n\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale [[industrialisation]], were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187\u2013192, 199}}.</ref> The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=294}}.</ref> Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad.

The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition.

The Stalinist attempts at establishing collective farms generally failed. Due to urbanization, the national percentage of the rural population decreased in communist Poland by about 50%.

The authorities responded with a major crackdown on opposition activity, including the firing of faculty and the dismissal of students at universities and other institutions of learning.

Using the context of the military victory of [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, some in the Polish communist leadership waged an antisemitic campaign against the remnants of the Jewish community in Poland. The targets of this campaign were accused of disloyalty and active sympathy with Israeli aggression. Branded \"[[Zionism|Zionists]]\", they were scapegoated and blamed for the unrest in March 1968, which eventually led to the emigration of much of Poland's remaining Jewish population (about 15,000 Polish citizens left the country).<ref name=\"Poland under Communism 148-163\"/>\n\nWith the active support of the Gomu\u0142ka regime, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the infamous [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968, after the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was informally announced.<ref name=\"Poland under Communism 163-171\">{{Harvnb|Kemp-Welch|2008|pp=163\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\nIn the final major achievement of Gomu\u0142ka diplomacy, the governments of Poland and [[West Germany]] signed in December 1970 the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], which normalized their relations and made possible meaningful cooperation in a number of areas of bilateral interest.

The December 1989 Sejm statute of credit relations reform introduced an \"incredible\" system of privileges for banks, which were allowed to unilaterally alter interest rates on already existing contracts. The exceedingly high rates they instantly introduced ruined many previously profitable enterprises and caused a complete breakdown of the apartment block construction industry, which had long-term deleterious effects on the state budget as well.

After 1945, the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing and a considerable degree of popular support in Poland.

Clarke]]'s ''[[Space Odyssey]]'', '''Monoliths''' are machines built by an unseen [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial species]]. <!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Apemen.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Monolith#Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0|Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0]]]] -->\nIn the series of novels (and the films based on these), three Monoliths are discovered in the [[Solar System]] by humans. The response of the characters to their discovery drives the plot of the series. It also influences the [[fictional universe|fictional history]] of the series, particularly by encouraging humankind to [[History of technology|progress with technological development]] and space travel.\n\nThe first [[Monolith]] appears at the beginning of the story, set in [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times. It is discovered by a group of [[hominids]] and somehow triggers a considerable shift in evolution, starting with the ability to use tools and weaponry. It is later revealed that thousands of other monoliths exist elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\n==Origins==\nThe extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths is never described in much detail, but some knowledge of its existence is given to [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|Dave Bowman]] after he is transported by the stargate to the \"cosmic zoo\", as detailed in the novels ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. The existence of this species is only hypothesized by the rest of humanity, but it is obvious because the Monolith was immediately identified as an [[Xenoarchaeology|artifact of non-human origin]].\n\nThe extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths developed [[intergalactic travel]] millions or perhaps billions of years before the present time. In the novels, Clarke refers to them as the \"Firstborn\" (not to be confused with the identically-named race in Arthur C. Clarke's and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[A Time Odyssey|Time Odyssey]]'' series) since they were quite possibly the first [[sapience|sapient]] species to possess a significant capability of interstellar travel. Members of this species explored the universe in the search of knowledge, and especially knowledge about other intelligent species.\n\nWhile these early explorers discovered that life was quite common, they observed that intelligent life was often stunted in its development, or else died out prematurely. Hence, they set about fostering it. The Firstborn were in many ways physically different from [[human being]]s, though from another point-of-view they were fundamentally the same: they were creatures made of \"flesh and blood\", and hence, like human beings, they were mortal.\n\nHowever, the evolutionary development projects they began would by their nature require very long timespans to complete, far longer than the lifetimes of their creators. Therefore, the aliens created increasingly complex automated machines to oversee and carry out their projects over the eons.  When they encountered a living world that had features in favor of the evolution of intelligent life, they left behind the monoliths as remote observers that were also capable of taking a variety of actions according to the wishes of their creators. One such planet, encountered when it was still quite young, was [[Earth]]. They also observed [[Jupiter]] and its watery moon, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The decaying ecology of [[Mars]] was also visited, but passed over in favor of more fruitful locations like Earth. The aliens left behind three Monoliths to observe and enact their plan to encourage humans to pursue technology and space travel.\n\nAs described in Clarke's novel, the Firstborn discovered later how to transfer their [[consciousness]] onto computers, and thus they became thinking machines. In the end, they surpassed even this achievement, and were able to transfer entirely from physical to non-corporeal forms\u2014the \"Lords of the Galaxy\"\u2014omniscient, immortal, and capable of travelling at great speeds. The Firstborn had abandoned physical form, but their creations, the Monoliths, remained, and these continued to carry out their original assignments.\n\n== Tycho Magnetic Anomalies ==\nThe term \"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly\" is something of a [[misnomer]] when referring to \"TMA-0\" and \"TMA-2\", since neither of these are found on the Moon (let alone in Tycho Crater) and neither one of them emits any significant [[magnetic field]], as described in the novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (the characters in some of the novels refer to this anomalous nomenclature quizzically). In the novel, the Russian crewmen of the [[spaceship]] ''[[List of spacecraft from the Space Odyssey series#The Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov|Alexei Leonov]]'' refer to the TMA-2 as \"Zagadka\" (from the Russian word for \"enigma\", \"mystery\", or \"riddle\").\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1===\nThe name ''Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1'' (also known as the TMA-1) refers to the strong [[magnetic field]] found somewhere in the lunar [[Tycho (crater)|Crater Tycho]] by an American scientific [[satellite]]. Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien Monolith]] buried about 15 meters below the surface. In the novel, when the Monolith is excavated and examined, it is found to be a black [[cuboid]] whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1\u00b2 : 2\u00b2 : 3\u00b2) and is sitting on a platform of the same material with undisturbed rock underneath that. Clarke suggests that this [[sequence]] or ratio extends past the three known spatial [[dimension]]s into [[Higher dimensions|much higher dimensions]].\n\nThe TMA-1 was dug up during the lunar night, but after sunrise and its exposure to direct sunlight, TMA-1 emits a single powerful burst of [[radio wave]]s \u2013 aimed at [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (a moon of [[Saturn]]) in the novel, and aimed at Jupiter in the motion picture. Its powerful magnetic field disappears immediately. In the novel, some scientists speculate that its magnetic field came from large electric currents, circulating in a system of [[superconductor]]s for millions of years as an energy-storage mechanism. All of that electric power was expended in the one radio signal.\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-2===\nAn identical (except in size) object was found later, orbiting [[Jupiter]] (on a moon of [[Saturn]] in the book, although this was changed to Jupiter in the sequel book, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''). This object was dubbed \"TMA-2\", a term that the book calls \"doubly inappropriate\": it had no magnetic field, and was millions of miles from Tycho (TMA-2 was often referred to as \"Big Brother\" due to [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]]'s comments on its immense size). In ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', HAL and Bowman destroy TMA-2 with a computer virus after it is learned that its superiors are sending an order to destroy humanity.\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0===\nIn the year 2513, the first Monolith to be encountered by humankind's prehistoric evolutionary predecessors (the one featured in the first novel) was found in [[Olduvai Gorge]], buried in ancient rock, and was retroactively dubbed \"TMA-0\".\n\n== Other Monoliths ==\nOther than the Monoliths bearing TMA labels, there are many other Monoliths that are seen in the series. In two instances, millions of Monoliths are generated for a limited time purpose. The first, in ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', Monoliths are generated to transform Jupiter into a star, subsequently named Lucifer. The second, in ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', they generate again to block both the Earth and human-settled [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] from their primary star in an attempt to destroy the humans.\n\n===The Great Wall===\nA large Monolith standing on its side on Europa is confirmed in 2061, though its existence is first implied in the second book. It is nicknamed the Great Wall after the [[Great Wall of China]], due to its horizontal orientation. It is believed to be watching over the Europans in a similar manner to TMA-0 in the first book. Halman mentions that it was damaged by the impact of Mount Zeus, which is discovered to be a single vast diamond, a shard from Jupiter's core that struck Europa's surface some time following Jupiter's transformation.\n\n===Minilith===\nA small Monolith appears before Heywood Floyd in 2061 on board the ''Galaxy'' spacecraft. He nicknames it \"Minilith\" for its small size compared to other observed Monoliths. At the end of the book it is explained that Halman used the Minilith to replicate Heywood Floyd's consciousness to help him uncover the Monolith's operations.\n\n==Appearance and capabilities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}\nIn the movies, all the Monoliths are black, extremely flat, non-reflective rectangular solids. In the first novel, the monolith on the African savannah was transparent and \"it was not easy to see except when the morning sun glinted on its edges\", but became less transparent when active and was described as a crystal. Also, the final monolith is described as a transparent crystal that becomes less transparent when active.\n\nIn the novels (not in the films), the dimensions of the monoliths are in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (the squares of the first three positive [[integers]]). These dimensions are the main source of debate about the simple external design of the Monoliths. It is suggested in the ''2001'' novel that this number series does not stop at three dimensions.<ref name=\"monolithdimensions\">Clarke A (1968). ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Signet. \"How obvious\u2014how necessary\u2014was that mathematical ratio of its sides, the quadratic sequence 1:4:9! And how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point, in only three dimensions!\"</ref>\n\nThe Monoliths come in several different sizes: TMA-0 and TMA-1 are both about 11 feet long and TMA-2 is two kilometres long on its longest axis, whereas the Monolith on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is considerably larger. They may be able to assume any size, because in ''2010: Odyssey Two'', the Star Child, created from the astronaut Dave Bowman, cryptically notes that the Monolith is actually one size \u2013 \"as large as necessary\".\n\nThe Monoliths are extremely long-lived and reliable machines, able to survive for millions of years buried in the ground or resisting [[meteorite impact]]s and [[radiation]] in space with no apparent damage. The two Monoliths recovered and examined by humans are virtually indestructible and impenetrable, resisting all attempts to analyse their composition or internal structure right up to the end of the series. [[Heywood R. Floyd|Dr. Heywood Floyd]] proposes they have some sort of [[force shield]], an impression he gets from touching it; this hypothesis is later accepted as probable because the Monoliths resist [[destructive testing]] beyond the theoretical limits of material strength. However, they are not completely indestructible: the TMA-4 has suffered from damage caused by a giant meteorite of solid diamond that collided with Europa in ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]''. In the final book, ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', all three Monoliths known to humankind are deactivated by being infected with a powerful [[computer virus]].\n\nWhile it is unclear what the composition of the Monoliths is, they clearly have mass, which is about the only observation that can be made. In the novel ''2010'', the crewmen of the [[spaceship]] ''Alexei Leonov'' measure the mass of TMA-2 and they find that it has a density slightly higher than that of air. The masses of TMA-0 and TMA-1 are never revealed by Clarke.\n\nIn ''2001'', TMA-2 opens up a stargate that takes Dave Bowman on a trip across the universe at [[faster-than-light]] speeds, and with as much acceleration as the creators of the stargate wish. In ''2010'' and again in ''3001'', TMA-2 [[teleportation|teleports]] itself.\n\nTMA-2 replicates itself by a form of symmetrical [[binary fission]] and [[exponential growth]] to create thousands or millions of identical Monoliths in just a matter of days. In ''2010'', the many units act to increase the density of Jupiter until [[stellar ignition]] is carried out, converting the planet into a miniature star. In ''3001'', millions of copies of TMA-2 assemble themselves into two [[megastructure]] disks that attempt to block the Sun from Earth and from its colonies in the Jovian system.\n\nThe Monoliths are clearly described in the novels as controlled by an internal computer, like [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]]s. In ''2061'', the consciousness of Dave Bowman, HAL-9000, and Dr. Floyd become incorporated as computer programs in TMA-2 as their new home. TMA-2 then observes the development of the Europans and guards them from any interplanetary (i.e. human) interference.\n\nBoth the TMA-1 and the TMA-2 produce occasional, powerful, directional [[radio transmission]]s. TMA-2 sends a radio transmission towards a star system about 450 [[light years]] away in the 22nd century. However, only TMA-1 ever exhibited any strong magnetic fields.\n\n==Actions==\nThe TMA-2 Monolith had judged that it would be desirable to nurture the primitive Europans by preventing the eventual freezing of their moon, and to keep humanity separated from them. TMA-2 thus converted Jupiter into a new star (dubbed \"Lucifer\", meaning \"light-bringer\") to warm Europa into more habitable conditions \u2013 at the cost of exterminating the Jovians, ocean-like creatures who swam through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. The Jovians were judged too primitive, as due to their environment they had no hope of ever developing to become an advanced civilization. \n\nIt also apparently decided in the early 21st century, that humanity was a failed species and was possibly necessary to destroy them.  Apparently the TMA-2 Monolith was allowed to destroy primitive species at its own discretion, but needed the authorisation of a \"superior\" to destroy an advanced spaceflight-capable civilisation such as humanity. This \"superior\" was a superior Monolith located in a distant star system, but even the Monoliths were limited by the [[speed of light]] in their [[interstellar communication]]s. Thus it took 450 years for the message sent by TMA-2 to reach its \"superior\", which then sent a message giving permission to destroy humanity, which took another 450 years to return to the Sol system in the year 3001. Due to the efforts of Frank Poole and the Europa team on Earth, the ascended Dave Bowman and AI HAL (now fused as one being \"Halman\" in the Monolith's computational matrix) were able to introduce a subtle computer virus into TMA-2 which destroyed it before it could render the human race extinct.\n\nThe Firstborn did not appear to have abandoned all interest in the evolutionary experiments overseen by the ancient Monoliths. Given that the Monoliths' communications are said to be limited by the speed of light, but Dave Bowman is sent on an interstellar journey at the end of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and Bowman is apparently transformed into the Star Child, not by the Monoliths, but by the Firstborn (both [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]] and Clarke have similarly stated that Bowman was transformed by non-corporeal aliens, not the Monoliths). They also subsequently transform HAL in 2010, to give Bowman a companion. The epilogue to ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' reveals that the Firstborn had been monitoring humanity's final confrontation with the Monoliths in the Sol system, but chose not to intervene. Unlike the TMA-2 Monolith, whose judgement of humanity was based on its social progress by the year 2001, the Firstborn considered the more peaceful and responsible humanity of the year 3001 worthy of survival, or at least not a threat to the Europans. Their assessment seems to prove true, as subsequently Frank Poole and the other humans land on Europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europans.\n\n==Design==\nThe first design for the Monolith for the ''2001'' film was a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] pyramid. This was taken from the short story \"[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]\" that the first story was based on.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YpritcZXPFoC&pg=PA82 |title = Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey: New Essays|isbn = 9780199724369|last1 = Kolker|first1 = Robert|date = 23 March 2006}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/unseen-images-2011-space-odyssey-making</ref>\nA London firm was approached to provide a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} [[plexiglass]] pyramid, and due to construction constraints they recommended a flat slab shape.

Clarke]]'s ''[[Space Odyssey]]'', '''Monoliths''' are machines built by an unseen [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial species]]. <!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Apemen.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Monolith#Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0|Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0]]]] -->\nIn the series of novels (and the films based on these), three Monoliths are discovered in the [[Solar System]] by humans. The response of the characters to their discovery drives the plot of the series. It also influences the [[fictional universe|fictional history]] of the series, particularly by encouraging humankind to [[History of technology|progress with technological development]] and space travel.\n\nThe first [[Monolith]] appears at the beginning of the story, set in [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times. It is discovered by a group of [[hominids]] and somehow triggers a considerable shift in evolution, starting with the ability to use tools and weaponry. It is later revealed that thousands of other monoliths exist elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\n==Origins==\nThe extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths is never described in much detail, but some knowledge of its existence is given to [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|Dave Bowman]] after he is transported by the stargate to the \"cosmic zoo\", as detailed in the novels ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. The existence of this species is only hypothesized by the rest of humanity, but it is obvious because the Monolith was immediately identified as an [[Xenoarchaeology|artifact of non-human origin]].\n\nThe extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths developed [[intergalactic travel]] millions or perhaps billions of years before the present time. In the novels, Clarke refers to them as the \"Firstborn\" (not to be confused with the identically-named race in Arthur C. Clarke's and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[A Time Odyssey|Time Odyssey]]'' series) since they were quite possibly the first [[sapience|sapient]] species to possess a significant capability of interstellar travel. Members of this species explored the universe in the search of knowledge, and especially knowledge about other intelligent species.\n\nWhile these early explorers discovered that life was quite common, they observed that intelligent life was often stunted in its development, or else died out prematurely. Hence, they set about fostering it. The Firstborn were in many ways physically different from [[human being]]s, though from another point-of-view they were fundamentally the same: they were creatures made of \"flesh and blood\", and hence, like human beings, they were mortal.\n\nHowever, the evolutionary development projects they began would by their nature require very long timespans to complete, far longer than the lifetimes of their creators. Therefore, the aliens created increasingly complex automated machines to oversee and carry out their projects over the eons.  When they encountered a living world that had features in favor of the evolution of intelligent life, they left behind the monoliths as remote observers that were also capable of taking a variety of actions according to the wishes of their creators. One such planet, encountered when it was still quite young, was [[Earth]]. They also observed [[Jupiter]] and its watery moon, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The decaying ecology of [[Mars]] was also visited, but passed over in favor of more fruitful locations like Earth. The aliens left behind three Monoliths to observe and enact their plan to encourage humans to pursue technology and space travel.\n\nAs described in Clarke's novel, the Firstborn discovered later how to transfer their [[consciousness]] onto computers, and thus they became thinking machines. In the end, they surpassed even this achievement, and were able to transfer entirely from physical to non-corporeal forms\u2014the \"Lords of the Galaxy\"\u2014omniscient, immortal, and capable of travelling at great speeds. The Firstborn had abandoned physical form, but their creations, the Monoliths, remained, and these continued to carry out their original assignments.\n\n== Tycho Magnetic Anomalies ==\nThe term \"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly\" is something of a [[misnomer]] when referring to \"TMA-0\" and \"TMA-2\", since neither of these are found on the Moon (let alone in Tycho Crater) and neither one of them emits any significant [[magnetic field]], as described in the novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (the characters in some of the novels refer to this anomalous nomenclature quizzically). In the novel, the Russian crewmen of the [[spaceship]] ''[[List of spacecraft from the Space Odyssey series#The Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov|Alexei Leonov]]'' refer to the TMA-2 as \"Zagadka\" (from the Russian word for \"enigma\", \"mystery\", or \"riddle\").\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1===\nThe name ''Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1'' (also known as the TMA-1) refers to the strong [[magnetic field]] found somewhere in the lunar [[Tycho (crater)|Crater Tycho]] by an American scientific [[satellite]]. Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien Monolith]] buried about 15 meters below the surface. In the novel, when the Monolith is excavated and examined, it is found to be a black [[cuboid]] whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1\u00b2 : 2\u00b2 : 3\u00b2) and is sitting on a platform of the same material with undisturbed rock underneath that. Clarke suggests that this [[sequence]] or ratio extends past the three known spatial [[dimension]]s into [[Higher dimensions|much higher dimensions]].\n\nThe TMA-1 was dug up during the lunar night, but after sunrise and its exposure to direct sunlight, TMA-1 emits a single powerful burst of [[radio wave]]s \u2013 aimed at [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (a moon of [[Saturn]]) in the novel, and aimed at Jupiter in the motion picture. Its powerful magnetic field disappears immediately. In the novel, some scientists speculate that its magnetic field came from large electric currents, circulating in a system of [[superconductor]]s for millions of years as an energy-storage mechanism. All of that electric power was expended in the one radio signal.\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-2===\nAn identical (except in size) object was found later, orbiting [[Jupiter]] (on a moon of [[Saturn]] in the book, although this was changed to Jupiter in the sequel book, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''). This object was dubbed \"TMA-2\", a term that the book calls \"doubly inappropriate\": it had no magnetic field, and was millions of miles from Tycho (TMA-2 was often referred to as \"Big Brother\" due to [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]]'s comments on its immense size). In ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', HAL and Bowman destroy TMA-2 with a computer virus after it is learned that its superiors are sending an order to destroy humanity.\n\n===Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0===\nIn the year 2513, the first Monolith to be encountered by humankind's prehistoric evolutionary predecessors (the one featured in the first novel) was found in [[Olduvai Gorge]], buried in ancient rock, and was retroactively dubbed \"TMA-0\".\n\n== Other Monoliths ==\nOther than the Monoliths bearing TMA labels, there are many other Monoliths that are seen in the series. In two instances, millions of Monoliths are generated for a limited time purpose. The first, in ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', Monoliths are generated to transform Jupiter into a star, subsequently named Lucifer. The second, in ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', they generate again to block both the Earth and human-settled [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] from their primary star in an attempt to destroy the humans.\n\n===The Great Wall===\nA large Monolith standing on its side on Europa is confirmed in 2061, though its existence is first implied in the second book. It is nicknamed the Great Wall after the [[Great Wall of China]], due to its horizontal orientation. It is believed to be watching over the Europans in a similar manner to TMA-0 in the first book. Halman mentions that it was damaged by the impact of Mount Zeus, which is discovered to be a single vast diamond, a shard from Jupiter's core that struck Europa's surface some time following Jupiter's transformation.\n\n===Minilith===\nA small Monolith appears before Heywood Floyd in 2061 on board the ''Galaxy'' spacecraft. He nicknames it \"Minilith\" for its small size compared to other observed Monoliths. At the end of the book it is explained that Halman used the Minilith to replicate Heywood Floyd's consciousness to help him uncover the Monolith's operations.\n\n==Appearance and capabilities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}\nIn the movies, all the Monoliths are black, extremely flat, non-reflective rectangular solids. In the first novel, the monolith on the African savannah was transparent and \"it was not easy to see except when the morning sun glinted on its edges\", but became less transparent when active and was described as a crystal. Also, the final monolith is described as a transparent crystal that becomes less transparent when active.\n\nIn the novels (not in the films), the dimensions of the monoliths are in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (the squares of the first three positive [[integers]]). These dimensions are the main source of debate about the simple external design of the Monoliths.

And how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point, in only three dimensions!\"</ref>\n\nThe Monoliths come in several different sizes: TMA-0 and TMA-1 are both about 11 feet long and TMA-2 is two kilometres long on its longest axis, whereas the Monolith on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is considerably larger.

He played [[college football]] for [[Oklahoma State University]], and was twice recognized as an [[All-American]]. He was drafted by the [[Seattle Seahawks]] with the sixth overall pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]], and has also played for the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].\n\n==Early years==\nOkung was born in [[Houston, Texas]].  He attended [[George Bush High School]] in Fort Bend, where he was a first-team All-Greater Houston and first-team all-district selection.  He was also one of the state's top performers in the [[discus throw]] (PR of 47.50 meters). Considered a three-star prospect by ''[[Rivals.com]]'',<ref>{{citation |title=Russell Okung Profile |url=https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?pr_key=40016&sport=1 |work=Rivals.com |accessdate= }}</ref> Okung was listed as the No. 33 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2006.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewrank.asp?ra_key=1150 |title=Offensive tackles 2006 |work=Rivals.com |date=January 30, 2006 }}.</ref>  At {{convert|250|lb|kg|0}} coming out of high school, he did not possess the prototypical tackle bulk.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/ncf/recruiting/tracker/player?recruitId=35168 |work=ESPN |title=Russell Okung Recruiting Profile |date=February 1, 2006 }}.</ref>  Okung was recruited by a number of major schools, including [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], and [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln|Nebraska]]. He committed to Oklahoma State in January 2006.\n\n==College career==\nOkung attended [[Oklahoma State University]], where he played for coach [[Mike Gundy]]'s [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football]] team from 2006 to 2009.  As a [[true freshman]], he moved into the starting lineup for the first time against [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] and held the position of right tackle for the rest of the season (eight straight starts). He ended the season by being voted as a member of All-Big 12 freshman team (by ''[[The Sporting News]]'') and was named the Dick Bogert Award winner as Oklahoma State's top freshman.\n\nIn his sophomore season, he started all thirteen games, having been moved permanently to left tackle. The Cowboys\u2019 offensive line gave up just five sacks in eight Big 12 games to lead the league in that category. Okung earned honorable mention all-Big 12 honors (by coaches). He was also named to the ''Rivals.com'' all-bowl team after holding Indiana's [[Greg Middleton]], the NCAA's sack leader, without a tackle in the [[2007 Insight Bowl]] victory.<ref>{{Citation |work=Rivals.com |date=January 9, 2008 |title=Coming up big in the biggest games |url=http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&CID=759478 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520153800/http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&CID=759478 |archivedate=May 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Russel Okung Broncos Practice 2016 - 2.jpg|thumb|left]]\nAs a junior, Okung led Oklahoma State with 71 knockdown blocks, and was named a first-team all-conference selection by the coaches.

The player can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater's tongue. If an ant bites the tongue at any other location, then the player loses a life. Pressing the second button will quickly retract the anteater's tongue. Worms will not harm the anteater unless eaten head first, in which case the player loses a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. Eating [[queen ant]]s at the very bottom of the nest will temporarily clear all ants and worms from the screen. Once the sun has traveled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear.  The spider climbs down the anteater's tongue, taking a life if it touches the tip.

The player can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater's tongue. If an ant bites the tongue at any other location, then the player loses a life. Pressing the second button will quickly retract the anteater's tongue. Worms will not harm the anteater unless eaten head first, in which case the player loses a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. Eating [[queen ant]]s at the very bottom of the nest will temporarily clear all ants and worms from the screen. Once the sun has traveled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear.  The spider climbs down the anteater's tongue, taking a life if it touches the tip. The object is to eat all of the larvae before time runs out, clearing the screen.  Each larva is worth 10 points.  Each ant is worth 100 points, while eating a worm is worth 200. Queen ants are worth 1,000. When losing a life or finishing a level, the ants get multiplied by the number of worms eaten.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.
