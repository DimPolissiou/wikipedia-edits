Various factors have contributed, including different interpretations of the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle; policies of the Hong Kong and central governments to encourage mainland visitors to Hong Kong; and the changing economic environment.\nMore broadly, there exists resentment toward mainland-Hong Kong convergence or assimilation, and toward perceived interference from mainland China in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\n<!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4254190/hong-kongs-newest-conflict-with-china-is-over-independence/|title=Hong Kong's Newest Conflict with China Is Over Independence|first=Simon Lewis/Hong|last=Kong|website=Time|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>-->\n<!--<ref>[http://frenchhk.com/2012/02/02/the-difficult-relationship-of-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA-and-%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%B8%E4%BA%BA-hong-kong-people-and-mainland-chinese/  \"The difficult relationship between \u9999\u6e2f\u4eba and \u5927\u9678\u4eba (Hong Kong people and mainland Chinese)\"]. 2 February 2010.

From 1941 to 1945, it was [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupied by the Japanese Empire]].\n\nIn 1972, after the [[China and the United Nations|change of the Chinese seat]] in the [[United Nations]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], established in 1949 after the lengthy [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], requested that Hong Kong be removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], thus depriving Hong Kong of its right to independence. The [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of December 1984 laid out the terms for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the [[United Kingdom]] to the PRC, which concluded with a [[Handover of Hong Kong|special handover ceremony]] on July 1, 1997.\n\nThe terms agreed between the governments for the transfer included a series of guarantees for the maintenance of Hong Kong's differing economic, political and legal systems after the transfer, and the further development of Hong Kong's political system with a goal of democratic government. These guarantees were set out in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and enshrined in the semi-constitutional [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]]. Initially, many Hong Kongers were enthusiastic about Hong Kong's return to China.\n\nHowever, tension has arisen between Hong Kong residents and the mainland, and in particular the central government, since 1997, and especially in the late 2000s and early 2010s.<ref>Charles, Custer [http://chineseculture.about.com/od/Chinese-Pop-Culture/fl/China-vs-Hong-Kong.htm  \"China vs. Hong Kong\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105154551/http://chineseculture.about.com/od/Chinese-Pop-Culture/fl/China-vs-Hong-Kong.htm |date=5 November 2014 }}. \"About News\".

From 1941 to 1945, it was [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupied by the Japanese Empire]].\n\nIn 1972, after the [[China and the United Nations|change of the Chinese seat]] in the [[United Nations]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], established in 1949 after the lengthy [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], requested that Hong Kong be removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], thus depriving Hong Kong of its right to independence. The [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of December 1984 laid out the terms for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the [[United Kingdom]] to the PRC, which concluded with a [[Handover of Hong Kong|special handover ceremony]] on July 1, 1997.\n\nThe terms agreed between the governments for the transfer included a series of guarantees for the maintenance of Hong Kong's differing economic, political and legal systems after the transfer, and the further development of Hong Kong's political system with a goal of democratic government. These guarantees were set out in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and enshrined in the semi-constitutional [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]]. Initially, many Hong Kongers were enthusiastic about Hong Kong's return to China.\n\nHowever, tension has arisen between Hong Kong residents and the mainland, and in particular the central government, since 1997, and especially in the late 2000s and early 2010s.<ref>Charles, Custer [http://chineseculture.about.com/od/Chinese-Pop-Culture/fl/China-vs-Hong-Kong.htm  \"China vs. Hong Kong\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105154551/http://chineseculture.about.com/od/Chinese-Pop-Culture/fl/China-vs-Hong-Kong.htm |date=5 November 2014 }}. \"About News\".

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

It succeeded  [[French Gothic architecture]]. The style was originally imported  from Italy next after the [[Hundred Years' War]] by the French kings [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], and [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley|in the Loire Valley]], notably the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau|Chateau de Montsoreau]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais|Chateau de Langeais]], the [[Chateau d'Amboise]], the [[Chateau of Blois]], the [[Chateau of Gaillon]], and the [[Chateau of Chambord]], and, closer to Paris, the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].\n\nThis style of [[French architecture]] had two distinct periods. During the first period, between about 1450 and 1540, the Italian style was copied directly, often by Italian architects and craftsmen.  In the second period, between 1540 and the end of the [[Valois dynasty]] in 1589, French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=80}}\n\nThe major architects of the style included the royal architects [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Pierre Lescot]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and the Italian architect and architectural theorist [[Sebastiano Serlio]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=193\u2013235}}{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=80\u201392}}\n\n==History \u2013 the Italian period==\nDuring the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] found the Loire Valley an ideal place of refuge. He was crowned in [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] following the [[Joan of Arc|Johan of Arc]] epic battles that began the departure of the English from the whole kingdom. The middle of the 15th century was a key period for the [[Loire Valley]] in the history of France and its architectural heritage. The greats of the kingdom settled in the region, fitting out medieval fortresses or erecting new buildings. Charles VII resided in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], which remained the seat of the court until 1450, and he and his dauphin, the future [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], ordered or authorized construction works to be carried out. Then began the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]. \n\nThus, from 1443-1453, the main building of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau|Chateau de Montsoreau]] is built on the [[Loire]] river banks by [[Jean II de Chambes]], diplomat in [[Venice]] and in [[Turkey]] and private counselor of King Charles VII. Between 1465 and 1469, Louis XI ordered the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais|Chateau de Langeais]] at the end of the promontory, a hundred meters in front of the 10th century dungeon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.valdeloire.org/Connaitre/Au-fil-de-l-histoire/Le-Val-de-Loire-siege-du-pouvoir-royal/Charles-VII-et-Louis-XI|title=Le Val de Loire Si\u00e8ge du pouvoir Royal - Charles VII et Louis XI|last=|first=|date=12 April 2017|website=UNESCO - Mission Val de Loire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref> \nIn 1494, [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] led a large army into Italy to capture [[Naples]], which had been seized by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]. He passed through [[Turin]], [[Milan]] and [[Florence]], and retook Naples on 22 February 1495. In that city he discovered the lavish gardens and the new architectural style of the [[Italian Renaissance]], which he judged far superior to that of his own medieval palace in [[Amboise]]. An anti-French coalition of armies forced him to retreat from Naples, but he took with him twenty-two skilled Italian craftsmen, including gardeners, sculptors, architects and engineers, including the scholar and architect [[Fra Giocondo]] and the architect and illustrator [[Domenico da Cortona]],  whom he assigned to remake his [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|chateau in Amboise]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=199}}\n\n=== Chateau de Montsoreau (1450\u20131461) ===\nIn 1453, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, Charles VII authorized the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau]] by Jean II de Chambes, then diplomat in Venice and Turkey and private adviser to the king. It was built on the site of the ancient fortress of [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou|Foulques Nerra]], unusually, directly on the Loire river bank in the style of [[Venetian Renaissance architecture|Venetian Renaissance]]. Its architecture is of transition between military and pleasure architecture and bears witness to the time when [[Castle|castles]] became [[Ch\u00e2teau|ch\u00e2teaux]]. The main building was built in 1453 and in an unprecedent manner, two square pavilions were added between 1453 and 1461, anticipating the [[classical architecture]] by several decades. Jean III de Chambes built or transformed the grand stairway tower in the Italian style in 1510\u20131515, its carvings are similar to the ones of the gate-house of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon|Chateau de Gaillon]].{{sfn|Congr\u00e8s arch\u00e9ologique|2003|page=255}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Reconstitution planim\u00e9trique chateau de montsoreau vers 1500.jpg|Plan of Montsoreau by Marquis de Geoffre\nFile:Chateau de Montsoreau Museum of contemporary art.jpg|Aerial view of the site\nFile:Chateau de Montsoreau Museum of contemporary art Loire Valley France.jpg|Loire facade of the chateau\nFile:Montsoreau - Ch\u00e2teau.jpg|Grand stairway Renaissance tower (circa 1510)\nFile:Most beautiful villages of the world montsoreau 2.jpg|High lucarnes flanked by pinnacles on the roof\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise (1491\u20131498)===\nIn 1491, before the Italian campaign, Charles VIII had begun rebuilding the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], turning it from a medieval castle into a more comfortable residence, with two wings and a chapel.  He returned from Italy to Amboise in March 1496, where nearly two hundred stonemasons and ninety other skilled craftsmen were already at work. Much of the building was already done in the earlier [[Medieval architecture|Medieval style]], with high ''[[Dormer#Types|lucarnes]]'' flanked by [[pinnacle]]s on the roof.  The first Renaissance additions were the large [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] on the ground floor, which opened out with a view of the Loire. Amboise also had, on the Hurtault tower, some of the first Renaissance [[pilasters]] in France, sculpted columns on the wall that were purely decorative.  The landscape architect whom Charles brought from Italy, [[Pacello da Mercogliano]], created the first [[Gardens of the French Renaissance|French Renaissance garden]] on the terrace, surrounded by a forged wrought iron fence. Charles did not see the ch\u00e2teau completed; he died there in 1498, after accidentally hitting his head on a lintel.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=201}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SchlossAmboiseStichDuCerceau.png|Plan of Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise by [[Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau]]\nFile:Amboise Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise 4.jpg|The Ch\u00e2teau beginning the transition from Medieval to Renaissance (1491\u201398)\nFile:Amboise (10042116135).jpg|Renaissance ornamental [[pilaster]] attached to the medieval Tour Heurtault \nFile:Amboise Chateau - panoramio.jpg|The wide bays opening on the terrace were a Renaissance feature\nFile:Amboise Ch\u00e2teau.jpg|Gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon and Ch\u00e2teau de Bury===\nNot all the architectural innovation took place in the Loire Valley. [[Georges d'Amboise]] was archbishop of Rouen, but also the chief minister for Italian affairs for both Louis XII and Charles VIII.  Between 1502 and 1509 he largely redecorated his residence in the valley of the [[Seine]],  the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon]], in the Italian style. He acquired a fountain, marble medallions from [[Genoa]],  sculpted frontons and pilasters with seashell ornamentation, and various architectural elements from Italy and used them in the ch\u1eadteau. Gradually, the decoration transformed the ch\u00e2teau from a medieval fortress to an elegant Renaissance residence.  Most of the Ch\u00e2teau was demolished in the 19th century, but some portions remain and some of the decoration is now on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e national des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais]] in Paris.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=204}}\n\nThe '''Ch\u00e2teau de Bury''', another medieval castle (since demolished),  was constructed beginning in 1511 by Florimond Robertet, a state secretary and treasurer for both Charles VIII and Fran\u00e7ois I.  Following the new style, it was designed for living, not for fighting.  It was perfectly symmetrical, with four round towers, around a central ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', which was decorated with a  statue of David by [[Michelangelo]]. A double stairway on the exterior at the main entrance replaced the traditional winding stairway within a tower. The facade was largely vertical, but was divided by horizontal ''cordons'' or bands of decoration following the style of palaces in Florence and Rome.  This symmetrical balance of horizontal and vertical lines became a prominent feature of the French Renaissance style.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=204\u2013215}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gaillon - Chateau 24.jpg|Window decoration of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon]]\nFile:Fen\u00eatre du ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon.jpg|Italian Renaissance window decoration in Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon (1502\u20131509)\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Bury.jpg|Ch\u00e2teau de Bury (begun 1511)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e1teau d'Azay-le-Rideau (1518\u20131527)===\nAs the French Court settled in Loire Valley, the courtiers and ministers built or rebuilt palatial residences nearby. The [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau]] (1518\u20131527) was constructed on an island in the Ile River by Gilles Berthelot, a wealthy banker from [[Tours]], who was president of the Chamber of Accounts, Receiver-General of Finances, and Treasurer of France.  From 1518 to 1524, dykes were built to stabilize the foundations. The towers were placed at the corners of the building, with an interior walkway around the building and a horizontal band between the two floors; a high roof and ''lucarnes'', or dormer windows, which rose above the [[roofline]] and  framed with pediments and topped with ornate  windows with pediments which rose above the roof level, which became the most recognizable feature of French Renaissance architecture. The double doorway was constructed like a small arch of triumph.  The grand stairway, in the Italian style, was the most important interior feature; it had a [[coffered]] ceiling decorated with sculpture.{{Sfn|Mignon|2017|pages-210-211}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-Azay-le-Rudeau-1.jpg|[[Chateau d'Azay-le-Rideau]] (1518\u20131527)\nFile:Azay-le-rideau (10143915634).jpg|The grand stairway of the Ch\u00e1teau, the centerpiece of the facade\nFile:Lucarne B Azay-le-rideau.JPG|Window with a ''lucarne,'' raised above the roof and framed with sculpted pilasters,  characteristic of French Renaissance style\nFile:Azey09gr.jpg|Coffered ceiling of the grand stairway\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau of Blois (1519\u20131536)===\nThe [[Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]] (1519\u20131536) was originally begun by [[Louis XII of France]], cousin and successor to Charles VIII. The original design was more medieval than Renaissance; only the pillars and decorated [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s of the columns on the courtyard, and the sculpture in light relief, showed the Italian influence.\n\nThe arrival of [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] in Blois, accompanied by his court and a large contingent of artists, made that ch\u00e2teau the centre of the French Renaissance.  It became his principal residence and he devoted much of his effort on rebuilding the north wing, called the ''Loges'', where his apartments were located. The architecture was inspired by the design of [[Donato Bramante]] for the [[Cortile del Belvedere]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]] in Rome. Its facade facing the courtyard presented arcades and niches decorated with pilasters in the Italian style, but it was left unfinished.  One characteristic feature of Fran\u00e7ois I decoration at Blois was the ''corniche aux coquilles'', a [[cornice]] with a sea shell motif.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=82\u201383}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Blois 05.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]] courtyard facade with circular stairway and ''lucarnes'' along the roof\nFile:Chateau de Blois 11.jpg|A sculpted salamander, the emblem of [[Fran\u00e7ois I]], on the facade of the north wing\nFile:4 Blois (25) (12883077533).jpg|Roofline decoration and ''lucarne'' of the Fran\u00e7ois I wing \n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord (1519\u20131538)===\nThe [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] was the summit of the early French Renaissance style, a harmonious combination of French tradition and Italian innovation.  [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] conceived the idea of a comfortable hunting lodge in the forest.  Work began in 1519, but was interrupted by the capture of the King by the Spanish-Imperial army at the  [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525.  It resumed in 1526 after the King was released, and was finished in 1538.  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a resident and died at Chambord in the same year that construction began,  and may have played a part in designing the unique double spiral stairway.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=212\u2013214}}\n\nThe plan of the Chateau is that of a medieval fortress, with round towers on the corners and massive [[keep]] or central tower, but the exuberant ornament is purely early French Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=84}}<ref>Cropplestone, Trewin (1963).

The roof is bristling with ''lucarnes'', chimneys and small towers.  The interior is symmetrical; the large central open space had as is centrepiece, the double spiral stairway. Ornament inspired by northern Italy predominates in the interior, in the form of a vaulted ceiling with carved decoration in each vault;  sculpted capitals on the columns;  and ''cul-de-lampes'', or sculpted decoration on the base of columns and arches where they met the wall.{{sfn|Ducher|1977|page=82}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFrance Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|Facade of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] (1519\u20131538)\nFile:Escalier-central-de-face.jpg|The double-spiral stairway at Chambord\nFile:Dormer windows of the Chambord Castle 01.jpg|A ''lucarne'' or [[dormer]] window at Chambord\nFile:5 Chambord (40) (13007720825).jpg|Sculpted vaulted ceiling at Chambord\nFile:ChambordRoof.jpg|Detail of the roof of Chambord, with ''lucarnes'', chimneys, and small towers around the central [[roof lantern|lantern tower]] \n</gallery>\n\n===The Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau===\nAfter he was released from his captivity in Spain in 1526, Fran\u00e7ois I decided to move his court from the Loire Valley to the [[Ile-de-France]] region centered in Paris.  He constructed or reconstructed seven ch\u00e2teaux in the Ile-de-France, the most important of which was the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=216\u2013217}}\n\nThe architect the King chose for Fontainebleau was [[Gilles Le Breton]].  Work commenced in 1528 with the remodeling of the medieval oval courtyard.  The 12th-century tower was preserved,  and a new residential block was constructed, its facade ornamented with pilasters and high windows with ''lucarnes'' and with triangular ''frontons'',  which became a signature feature of the new style. The old medieval ''chatelet'', or gatehouse, was replaced by a new structure, the ''Porte Dor\u00e9e'', which was composed of grand [[loggia]]s one above the other, modeled after the palaces of [[Naples]] and [[Urbino]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013219}} \n\nThe second phase was new courtyard, the Cheval Blanc, with three long wings constructed of brick and ''moellons et enduit'', a mixture of rubble and cement, which became a common combination in French Renassiance architecture.  The round medieval towers of the old Chateau were replaced by square pavilions with high roofs and lucarne windows.  The third phase was a new gallery to connect the old and new buildings. The decor of this new gallery was created by a Tuscan craftsman, [[Rosso Fiorentino]]. who arrived in 1530.  The final new project was a grand stairway on the oval court leading up the royal apartments.  It had a portico with classical columns resembling a [[triumphal arch]].  The design of this stairway was not borrowed from Italy, but copied directly from classical Roman models.  It was a sign of the beginning of more originality in French Renaissance architecture.{{Sfn|Mignon|2017|page=219}}{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013219}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fontainebleau facade.JPG|The ''Porte Dor\u00e9e'', or gatehouse, with large loggias one above the other, and lucarne windows with triangular frontons\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau 2011 (262).JPG|The Fran\u00e7ois I Gallery at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] (1533\u20131539)\nFile:Fontainebleau interior francois I gallery 02.JPG|''An elephant'' by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], illustrating the mixed sculptural and painted decoration in the Fran\u00e7ois I Gallery of Fontainebleau\nFile:Le Grand Escalier \u00e0 Fer de Cheval.jpg|The horseshoe stairway was originally built for Henry II by [[Philibert Delorme]] between 1547 and 1559, then rebuilt for Louis XIII by [[Jean Androuet du Cerceau]] in about 1640.\n</gallery>\n\nBeginning in 1530, the group of Italian artists imported by Fran\u00e7ois I, led by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolo dell' Abbate]], known as the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], decorated the interiors of the new rooms.  The artists became known as the School of Fontainebleau and their work had a major influence on Renaissance decoration throughout Europe.  Their work included frescoes in elaborate stucco sculptural frames, [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]] in all forms, and medallions in high relief.  The architecture was ornamented with sculpture of [[putti]], of garlands of fruit, of satyrs and heroic figures from mythology. The most important works included twelve rectangular frescos, in highly decorative sculptured frames,  in the Gallery of Fran\u00e7ois I (1533\u20131539).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=86\u201388}}\n\nFollowing the death of Francis I in 1547, his successor King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] continued to enlarge and embellish the chateau. The architects [[Philibert Delorme]] and [[Jean Bullant]] extended the east wing of the lower court, and decorated it with the first famous horseshoe-shaped staircase. In the oval court, they transformed the loggia planned by Francois into a ''Salle des F\u00e9tes'' or grand ballroom with a coffered ceiling.  They designed a new building, the ''Pavillon des Poeles'',  to contain the new apartments of the King.  The painters Primaticcio and Niccol\u00f2 dell'Abbate continued their decoration of the new ballroom and the gallery of Ulysses with murals by Primaticcio framed in ornately sculptured stucco.<ref name=\"Salmon, p 9\">Salmon, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Other ch\u00e2teaux of Fran\u00e7ois I period===\nFran\u00e7ois I began other chateaux in the Paris region,  The biggest and most impressive was the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid]], in what is now the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], which he began in 1527, because he found the Louvre uncomfortable. It was largely abandoned and then demolished in the late 18th century.  Another late ch\u00e2teau created by Fran\u00e7ois I is the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The facade was entirely redone and, unlike the earlier ch\u00e2teaux, it was given an Italianate flat terrace roof lined with large stone vases with an emerging caved flame. Other notable ch\u00e2teaux of this period include the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Ancy-le-Franc]] (1538\u20131546) in Burgundy.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013224}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye01.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], reconstructed by Fran\u00e7ois I beginning in 1539\nFile:Saint-Germain-en-Laye Ch\u00e2teau Vieux 2011 081.jpg|Decoration of the portal of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]\nFile:Bastiments v1 (Gregg 1972 p34) - Madrid front facade.jpg|Facade of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid]], begun 1527, completed 1552, demolished 1792\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Second period \u2013 Classical influence==\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe second period of French Renaissance architecture commenced in about 1540, late in the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, and continued until the death of his successor [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559.  This period is sometimes described as the high point of the style.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=159}} It included work by Italian architects including [[Giacomo Vignola]] and [[Sebastiano Serlio]], but more and more it was made by French architects,  particularly [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Pierre Lescot]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and by the sculptor [[Jean Goujon]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}}\n\nThe features of this period included the greater use of the ancient [[Classical order]]s of columns and pilasters, preceding from the most massive to the lightest.  This meant starting at the bottom with the [[Doric order]], then the [[Ionic order|Ionic]], then the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] on top.  The order used on each level determined the style of that level of the facade. Philibert Delorme went further and added two new orders to his facades:  French Doric and French Ionic. These columns were regular Doric and Ionic columns decorated with ornamental bands or rings.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}}\n\nThe second period featured also a wide variety of decorative plaques and sculptural decoration on the facades, usually borrowed from ancient Greek or Roman models.  These included the [[caryatide]], elaborate [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]],  ''renomm\u00e9es'', relief statues representing [[Pheme|Fame]], over doorways, ''grotesques'', often in the form of [[satyrs]] and [[griffin|griffons]], and sculpted draperies and garlands.  They also often included stylized monograms of the initials of the owner.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Character of Renaissance Architecture 0250.jpg|Doorway design by [[Philibert Delorme]]\nFile:Character of Renaissance Architecture 0245.jpg|French [[Doric order]] column by [[Philibert Delorme]] \nFile:Androuet du Cerceau, Jacques I 1560 Fontaine des Saints Innocents \u00e0 Paris - Gallica 2014.jpg|Plan of the [[Fontaine des Innocents]] by [[Philibert Delorme]] (1547\u20131550)\nFile:Fontaine des Innocents reliefs.

It originally had three wings, a chapel and a large garden, as well as an imposing gatehouse, whose centerpiece was the famous Nymph statue by [[Cellini]], now at Fontainebleau, along with sculptures of a stag and two hunting dogs.  The porch of the main facade was also a striking innovation; it was the first correct use in France of the three classical orders, one above the other.  Only a few of the original buildings remain.  The central building was later demolished, but the porch can be seen today in the courtyard of the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.  A third innovative feature was the chapel, consecrated in 1553. In his plan, Delorme combined the forms of the square, the [[Greek cross]] and the circle.  The dome had a spiral coffered interior, resembling those in ancient Rome; it  was one of the first of its kind in France.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=233}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Collection- A.

The columns of the facade rise all the way to the roofline. The interior is also remarkable, with some of the original ceramic tile floor still in place and highly decorated fireplaces.

The project was undertaken by [[Pierre Lescot]], a nobleman and architect, and was modified by the new King, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], who added a new pavilion on the southwest to serve as his residence.  The result was a skillful blend of Italian and French elements.  The facade featured arcades on the ground level in the Italian style, and was divided by three ''avant-corps'' decorated with sets of twin Corinthian columns and topped with consoles with rounded frontons.  These vertical elements were balanced by the strong horizontal bands marking the floors, and by the gradual and subtle change of the ornament on each level, representing the three classical orders of architecture. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=90}}  To avoid monotony, the frontons of the windows alternated between triangles and rounded arches. The top floor did not have a high roof ''lucarnes'', like most other French Renaissance buildings; it was composed instead of alternating windows and sculptural decoration, beneath a new kind of roof, the called a ''comble bris\u00e9'', which had two different angles of slope.  It was crowned with a ridge of ornament.{{Sfn|Mignon|1917|page=230}}\n\nThe sculptural decoration on the facade, by [[Jean Goujon]] was especially remarkable.  On the two lower levels, it was discreet, composed of inlays of polychrome marble and [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] with sculpted garlands. However, on the attic or top floor, he lavishly covered every part of the wall with sculptures of slaves, warriors, trophies, and mythical divinities, representing in classical style the military triumphs of France.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=90}}\n\nInside the [[Lescot Wing]] the decoration was inspired by ancient Greece.  In the ballroom, the balcony for the musicians was carried by [[caryatide]]s made by Jean Goujon, inspired by those on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in Athens. Goujon was also responsible for the coffered ceiling of the right stairway of the Lescot Wing, decorated with a sculpture of hunting scenes.{{Sfn|Mignon|1917|page=231}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bastiments v1 (Gregg 1972 p20) - Louvre west wing court facade.jpg|Lescot's facade as illustrated in ''Les plus excellents b\u00e2timents de France'' (1576)\nFile:Paris 75001 Cour Carr\u00e9e Louvre Aile Lescot 01a frontal.jpg|West facade of the [[Lescot Wing]]\nFile:Paris Palais du Louvre Salle des Caryatides tribune 20161031.jpg|[[Caryatides]] supporting the musical tribune by [[Jean Goujon]]\nFile:Escalera de Enrique II.

As one of the first manifestations of the French classicism, its exceptionals ornementation and pristine condition earn it a mention in every overview of French Renaissance<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\">Explanatory comments of ''Toulouse Renaissance'' exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.</ref>.\n\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat, a wealthy [[Isatis tinctoria|woad merchant]], launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), take their inspiration from the great classical models such as the [[Coliseum]]. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]]\u2014expresses order and regularity<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>.\n\nAfter Bachelier's death in 1557 the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to Mannerist architecture<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bachelier_-_H\u00f4tel_d'Ass\u00e9zat_-_Toulouse.jpg|The courtyard and the staircase tower (1555-1557)\nFile:Assezat-colonnes-jumelles.jpg|Fluted and rudented columns\nFile:Chapiteaux-assezat.jpg|Doric, Ionic and Corinthian capitals\nFile:Assezat-Serlio-en.jpg|Influence of an engraving by [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]]\nFile:Assezat-02(12).jpg|The main gate\n</gallery>\n\n==Religious architecture==\nThe Renaissance had less influence on French religious architecture; cathedrals and churches, for the most part, continued to be built or rebuilt in the [[Flamboyant]] [[French Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].  However, a few classical elements introduced during the Renaissance appeared in churches.  Examples include the classical portals of the churches of [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], directly across from the new Lescot Wing of the Louvre, and [[Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs]] in Paris. The latter was borrowed directly from the Palace of Tournelles, designed by [[Philibert de l'Orme|Philibert Delorme]].  The church of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131552), near the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]] in Paris, has a Gothic choir, but a facade with a classical pediment, balustrades with classical columns a remarkable [[rood]], or bridge, crossing the nave. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24\u201325}}\n\nThe Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris]] (1532\u20131640), in the center of Paris, was begun by [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and is second in size only to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] among Paris churches.  It is a hybrid of Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance styles. The  exterior, plan and vaulted ceiling are Gothic, but the orders of classical columns and other Renaissance elements appear in the interior.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24\u201325}}\n\nOne of the finest religious monuments of the French Renaissance is the tomb of Fran\u00e7ois I and his wife Claude de France, located within the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] (1547\u20131561).  It was created by the architect Philibert Delorme and the sculptor [[Pierre Bontemps]].  The principal element is a triumphal arch, modeled after the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome,  crowned with four statues of fame, as well as the King and Queen. The vault of the arch and the entablement are richly decorated with sculptural decoration of olive leaves and other classical themes, and with tablets of black and white marble. The tall, slender columns give the tomb an exceptional lightness and grace.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=94}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Church Saint Eustache, Paris (interior).jpg|Interior of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], Paris \nFile:St-Etienne-du-Mont Interior 3, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|[[Rood]] screen of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131545)\nFile:P1020129 Paris V Eglise Saint-Etienne-du-Mont fa\u00e7ade reductwk.JPG|Facade with classical orders of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131552) in Paris\nFile:Francois-1-Claude-de-France2.jpg|Tomb of Fran\u00e7ois I and Claude of France (c. 1547\u201361) \nFile:P1340838 Paris III eglise St-Nicolas-des-champs portail sud rwk.jpg|South portal of [[Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs]] (1559) in Paris\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Last projects==\nAfter the death of King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], France was torn by the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]], which largely pushed aside architecture and design.  Nonetheless, a few last Renaissance projects were launched, largely inspired by [[Catherine de Medici]], the widow of Henry II.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}  The most important project of the period was the new [[Tuileries Palace]].  It was designed by the chief royal architect, Philibert Delorme, in response to the Queen's wish for a modern palace with a large park on what was then the edge of the city. It featured a central pavilion with low wings composed of arcades topped by a residential floor with alternating [[dormer]] windows triangular frontons.  All the facades lavishly decorated in the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance style]], including elongated sculpted figures inspired by the works of [[Michelangelo]].  After the death of Delorme in 1570, the task was taken up by [[Jean Bullant]], but then it was interrupted again by the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, and was not completed until decades later. The decorations invented by Delorme included a new style of classical columns, French Corinthian, banded with several ornamental rings.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}\n\nCatherine de Medici also imposed the Italian style at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], with the construction of a new wing, the ''Aile de la Belle Chimin\u00e9e'' (wing of the beautiful chimney). The facade was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and featured a combination of Italian and French elements; pilasters, statues in niches, a high roof with lucarnes, a central [[Frontispiece (architecture)|frontispiece]] resembling Italian church architecture, and two diverging stairways.\n\nThe second plan of the Ch\u00e2teau de Verneuil (since demolished) by the young architect [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1576) was another landmark of the late French Renaissance style. It was commanded by [[Henry IV of France]].  Its symmetry, corner pavilions, twin pilasters, discreet roof, absence of lucarnes and its rotunda at the entrance made it a concise summary of the French Renaissance style at the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}\n\nCatherine de Medici also commissioned additions to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]].  The bridge over the [[Cher (river)|Cher river]] had been built by Philibert Delorme. After his death in 1570, Catherine asked Jean Bullant to built a picturesque gallery (1576) atop the bridge.

It succeeded  [[French Gothic architecture]]. The style was originally imported  from Italy next after the [[Hundred Years' War]] by the French kings [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], and [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley|in the Loire Valley]], notably the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau|Chateau de Montsoreau]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais|Chateau de Langeais]], the [[Chateau d'Amboise]], the [[Chateau of Blois]], the [[Chateau of Gaillon]], and the [[Chateau of Chambord]], and, closer to Paris, the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].\n\nThis style of [[French architecture]] had two distinct periods. During the first period, between about 1450 and 1540, the Italian style was copied directly, often by Italian architects and craftsmen.  In the second period, between 1540 and the end of the [[Valois dynasty]] in 1589, French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=80}}\n\nThe major architects of the style included the royal architects [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Pierre Lescot]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and the Italian architect and architectural theorist [[Sebastiano Serlio]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=193\u2013235}}{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=80\u201392}}\n\n==History \u2013 the Italian period==\nDuring the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] found the Loire Valley an ideal place of refuge. He was crowned in [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] following the [[Joan of Arc|Johan of Arc]] epic battles that began the departure of the English from the whole kingdom. The middle of the 15th century was a key period for the [[Loire Valley]] in the history of France and its architectural heritage. The greats of the kingdom settled in the region, fitting out medieval fortresses or erecting new buildings. Charles VII resided in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], which remained the seat of the court until 1450, and he and his dauphin, the future [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], ordered or authorized construction works to be carried out. Then began the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]. \n\nThus, from 1443-1453, the main building of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau|Chateau de Montsoreau]] is built on the [[Loire]] river banks by [[Jean II de Chambes]], diplomat in [[Venice]] and in [[Turkey]] and private counselor of King Charles VII. Between 1465 and 1469, Louis XI ordered the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais|Chateau de Langeais]] at the end of the promontory, a hundred meters in front of the 10th century dungeon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.valdeloire.org/Connaitre/Au-fil-de-l-histoire/Le-Val-de-Loire-siege-du-pouvoir-royal/Charles-VII-et-Louis-XI|title=Le Val de Loire Si\u00e8ge du pouvoir Royal - Charles VII et Louis XI|last=|first=|date=12 April 2017|website=UNESCO - Mission Val de Loire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref> \nIn 1494, [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] led a large army into Italy to capture [[Naples]], which had been seized by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]. He passed through [[Turin]], [[Milan]] and [[Florence]], and retook Naples on 22 February 1495. In that city he discovered the lavish gardens and the new architectural style of the [[Italian Renaissance]], which he judged far superior to that of his own medieval palace in [[Amboise]]. An anti-French coalition of armies forced him to retreat from Naples, but he took with him twenty-two skilled Italian craftsmen, including gardeners, sculptors, architects and engineers, including the scholar and architect [[Fra Giocondo]] and the architect and illustrator [[Domenico da Cortona]],  whom he assigned to remake his [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|chateau in Amboise]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=199}}\n\n=== Chateau de Montsoreau (1450\u20131461) ===\nIn 1453, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, Charles VII authorized the construction of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau]] by Jean II de Chambes, then diplomat in Venice and Turkey and private adviser to the king. It was built on the site of the ancient fortress of [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou|Foulques Nerra]], unusually, directly on the Loire river bank in the style of [[Venetian Renaissance architecture|Venetian Renaissance]]. Its architecture is of transition between military and pleasure architecture and bears witness to the time when [[Castle|castles]] became [[Ch\u00e2teau|ch\u00e2teaux]]. The main building was built in 1453 and in an unprecedent manner, two square pavilions were added between 1453 and 1461, anticipating the [[classical architecture]] by several decades. Jean III de Chambes built or transformed the grand stairway tower in the Italian style in 1510\u20131515, its carvings are similar to the ones of the gate-house of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon|Chateau de Gaillon]].{{sfn|Congr\u00e8s arch\u00e9ologique|2003|page=255}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Reconstitution planim\u00e9trique chateau de montsoreau vers 1500.jpg|Plan of Montsoreau by Marquis de Geoffre\nFile:Chateau de Montsoreau Museum of contemporary art.jpg|Aerial view of the site\nFile:Chateau de Montsoreau Museum of contemporary art Loire Valley France.jpg|Loire facade of the chateau\nFile:Montsoreau - Ch\u00e2teau.jpg|Grand stairway Renaissance tower (circa 1510)\nFile:Most beautiful villages of the world montsoreau 2.jpg|High lucarnes flanked by pinnacles on the roof\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise (1491\u20131498)===\nIn 1491, before the Italian campaign, Charles VIII had begun rebuilding the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], turning it from a medieval castle into a more comfortable residence, with two wings and a chapel.  He returned from Italy to Amboise in March 1496, where nearly two hundred stonemasons and ninety other skilled craftsmen were already at work. Much of the building was already done in the earlier [[Medieval architecture|Medieval style]], with high ''[[Dormer#Types|lucarnes]]'' flanked by [[pinnacle]]s on the roof.  The first Renaissance additions were the large [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] on the ground floor, which opened out with a view of the Loire. Amboise also had, on the Hurtault tower, some of the first Renaissance [[pilasters]] in France, sculpted columns on the wall that were purely decorative.  The landscape architect whom Charles brought from Italy, [[Pacello da Mercogliano]], created the first [[Gardens of the French Renaissance|French Renaissance garden]] on the terrace, surrounded by a forged wrought iron fence. Charles did not see the ch\u00e2teau completed; he died there in 1498, after accidentally hitting his head on a lintel.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=201}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SchlossAmboiseStichDuCerceau.png|Plan of Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise by [[Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau]]\nFile:Amboise Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise 4.jpg|The Ch\u00e2teau beginning the transition from Medieval to Renaissance (1491\u201398)\nFile:Amboise (10042116135).jpg|Renaissance ornamental [[pilaster]] attached to the medieval Tour Heurtault \nFile:Amboise Chateau - panoramio.jpg|The wide bays opening on the terrace were a Renaissance feature\nFile:Amboise Ch\u00e2teau.jpg|Gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon and Ch\u00e2teau de Bury===\nNot all the architectural innovation took place in the Loire Valley. [[Georges d'Amboise]] was archbishop of Rouen, but also the chief minister for Italian affairs for both Louis XII and Charles VIII.  Between 1502 and 1509 he largely redecorated his residence in the valley of the [[Seine]],  the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon]], in the Italian style. He acquired a fountain, marble medallions from [[Genoa]],  sculpted frontons and pilasters with seashell ornamentation, and various architectural elements from Italy and used them in the ch\u1eadteau. Gradually, the decoration transformed the ch\u00e2teau from a medieval fortress to an elegant Renaissance residence.  Most of the Ch\u00e2teau was demolished in the 19th century, but some portions remain and some of the decoration is now on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e national des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais]] in Paris.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=204}}\n\nThe '''Ch\u00e2teau de Bury''', another medieval castle (since demolished),  was constructed beginning in 1511 by Florimond Robertet, a state secretary and treasurer for both Charles VIII and Fran\u00e7ois I.  Following the new style, it was designed for living, not for fighting.  It was perfectly symmetrical, with four round towers, around a central ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', which was decorated with a  statue of David by [[Michelangelo]]. A double stairway on the exterior at the main entrance replaced the traditional winding stairway within a tower. The facade was largely vertical, but was divided by horizontal ''cordons'' or bands of decoration following the style of palaces in Florence and Rome.  This symmetrical balance of horizontal and vertical lines became a prominent feature of the French Renaissance style.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=204\u2013215}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gaillon - Chateau 24.jpg|Window decoration of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon]]\nFile:Fen\u00eatre du ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon.jpg|Italian Renaissance window decoration in Ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon (1502\u20131509)\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Bury.jpg|Ch\u00e2teau de Bury (begun 1511)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e1teau d'Azay-le-Rideau (1518\u20131527)===\nAs the French Court settled in Loire Valley, the courtiers and ministers built or rebuilt palatial residences nearby. The [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau]] (1518\u20131527) was constructed on an island in the Ile River by Gilles Berthelot, a wealthy banker from [[Tours]], who was president of the Chamber of Accounts, Receiver-General of Finances, and Treasurer of France.  From 1518 to 1524, dykes were built to stabilize the foundations. The towers were placed at the corners of the building, with an interior walkway around the building and a horizontal band between the two floors; a high roof and ''lucarnes'', or dormer windows, which rose above the [[roofline]] and  framed with pediments and topped with ornate  windows with pediments which rose above the roof level, which became the most recognizable feature of French Renaissance architecture. The double doorway was constructed like a small arch of triumph.  The grand stairway, in the Italian style, was the most important interior feature; it had a [[coffered]] ceiling decorated with sculpture.{{Sfn|Mignon|2017|pages-210-211}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-Azay-le-Rudeau-1.jpg|[[Chateau d'Azay-le-Rideau]] (1518\u20131527)\nFile:Azay-le-rideau (10143915634).jpg|The grand stairway of the Ch\u00e1teau, the centerpiece of the facade\nFile:Lucarne B Azay-le-rideau.JPG|Window with a ''lucarne,'' raised above the roof and framed with sculpted pilasters,  characteristic of French Renaissance style\nFile:Azey09gr.jpg|Coffered ceiling of the grand stairway\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau of Blois (1519\u20131536)===\nThe [[Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]] (1519\u20131536) was originally begun by [[Louis XII of France]], cousin and successor to Charles VIII. The original design was more medieval than Renaissance; only the pillars and decorated [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s of the columns on the courtyard, and the sculpture in light relief, showed the Italian influence.\n\nThe arrival of [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] in Blois, accompanied by his court and a large contingent of artists, made that ch\u00e2teau the centre of the French Renaissance.  It became his principal residence and he devoted much of his effort on rebuilding the north wing, called the ''Loges'', where his apartments were located. The architecture was inspired by the design of [[Donato Bramante]] for the [[Cortile del Belvedere]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]] in Rome. Its facade facing the courtyard presented arcades and niches decorated with pilasters in the Italian style, but it was left unfinished.  One characteristic feature of Fran\u00e7ois I decoration at Blois was the ''corniche aux coquilles'', a [[cornice]] with a sea shell motif.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=82\u201383}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Blois 05.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]] courtyard facade with circular stairway and ''lucarnes'' along the roof\nFile:Chateau de Blois 11.jpg|A sculpted salamander, the emblem of [[Fran\u00e7ois I]], on the facade of the north wing\nFile:4 Blois (25) (12883077533).jpg|Roofline decoration and ''lucarne'' of the Fran\u00e7ois I wing \n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord (1519\u20131538)===\nThe [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] was the summit of the early French Renaissance style, a harmonious combination of French tradition and Italian innovation.  [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] conceived the idea of a comfortable hunting lodge in the forest.  Work began in 1519, but was interrupted by the capture of the King by the Spanish-Imperial army at the  [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525.  It resumed in 1526 after the King was released, and was finished in 1538.  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a resident and died at Chambord in the same year that construction began,  and may have played a part in designing the unique double spiral stairway.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=212\u2013214}}\n\nThe plan of the Chateau is that of a medieval fortress, with round towers on the corners and massive [[keep]] or central tower, but the exuberant ornament is purely early French Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=84}}<ref>Cropplestone, Trewin (1963). ''World Architecture''. Hamlyn. p. 254</ref>  The facade has pilasters at regular intervals, balanced by horizontal bands of relief sculpture. The roof is bristling with ''lucarnes'', chimneys and small towers.  The interior is symmetrical; the large central open space had as is centrepiece, the double spiral stairway. Ornament inspired by northern Italy predominates in the interior, in the form of a vaulted ceiling with carved decoration in each vault;  sculpted capitals on the columns;  and ''cul-de-lampes'', or sculpted decoration on the base of columns and arches where they met the wall.{{sfn|Ducher|1977|page=82}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFrance Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|Facade of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] (1519\u20131538)\nFile:Escalier-central-de-face.jpg|The double-spiral stairway at Chambord\nFile:Dormer windows of the Chambord Castle 01.jpg|A ''lucarne'' or [[dormer]] window at Chambord\nFile:5 Chambord (40) (13007720825).jpg|Sculpted vaulted ceiling at Chambord\nFile:ChambordRoof.jpg|Detail of the roof of Chambord, with ''lucarnes'', chimneys, and small towers around the central [[roof lantern|lantern tower]] \n</gallery>\n\n===The Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau===\nAfter he was released from his captivity in Spain in 1526, Fran\u00e7ois I decided to move his court from the Loire Valley to the [[Ile-de-France]] region centered in Paris.  He constructed or reconstructed seven ch\u00e2teaux in the Ile-de-France, the most important of which was the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=216\u2013217}}\n\nThe architect the King chose for Fontainebleau was [[Gilles Le Breton]].  Work commenced in 1528 with the remodeling of the medieval oval courtyard.  The 12th-century tower was preserved,  and a new residential block was constructed, its facade ornamented with pilasters and high windows with ''lucarnes'' and with triangular ''frontons'',  which became a signature feature of the new style. The old medieval ''chatelet'', or gatehouse, was replaced by a new structure, the ''Porte Dor\u00e9e'', which was composed of grand [[loggia]]s one above the other, modeled after the palaces of [[Naples]] and [[Urbino]].{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013219}} \n\nThe second phase was new courtyard, the Cheval Blanc, with three long wings constructed of brick and ''moellons et enduit'', a mixture of rubble and cement, which became a common combination in French Renassiance architecture.  The round medieval towers of the old Chateau were replaced by square pavilions with high roofs and lucarne windows.  The third phase was a new gallery to connect the old and new buildings. The decor of this new gallery was created by a Tuscan craftsman, [[Rosso Fiorentino]]. who arrived in 1530.  The final new project was a grand stairway on the oval court leading up the royal apartments.  It had a portico with classical columns resembling a [[triumphal arch]].  The design of this stairway was not borrowed from Italy, but copied directly from classical Roman models.  It was a sign of the beginning of more originality in French Renaissance architecture.{{Sfn|Mignon|2017|page=219}}{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013219}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fontainebleau facade.JPG|The ''Porte Dor\u00e9e'', or gatehouse, with large loggias one above the other, and lucarne windows with triangular frontons\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau 2011 (262).JPG|The Fran\u00e7ois I Gallery at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] (1533\u20131539)\nFile:Fontainebleau interior francois I gallery 02.JPG|''An elephant'' by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], illustrating the mixed sculptural and painted decoration in the Fran\u00e7ois I Gallery of Fontainebleau\nFile:Le Grand Escalier \u00e0 Fer de Cheval.jpg|The horseshoe stairway was originally built for Henry II by [[Philibert Delorme]] between 1547 and 1559, then rebuilt for Louis XIII by [[Jean Androuet du Cerceau]] in about 1640.\n</gallery>\n\nBeginning in 1530, the group of Italian artists imported by Fran\u00e7ois I, led by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolo dell' Abbate]], known as the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], decorated the interiors of the new rooms.  The artists became known as the School of Fontainebleau and their work had a major influence on Renaissance decoration throughout Europe.  Their work included frescoes in elaborate stucco sculptural frames, [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]] in all forms, and medallions in high relief.  The architecture was ornamented with sculpture of [[putti]], of garlands of fruit, of satyrs and heroic figures from mythology. The most important works included twelve rectangular frescos, in highly decorative sculptured frames,  in the Gallery of Fran\u00e7ois I (1533\u20131539).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=86\u201388}}\n\nFollowing the death of Francis I in 1547, his successor King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] continued to enlarge and embellish the chateau. The architects [[Philibert Delorme]] and [[Jean Bullant]] extended the east wing of the lower court, and decorated it with the first famous horseshoe-shaped staircase. In the oval court, they transformed the loggia planned by Francois into a ''Salle des F\u00e9tes'' or grand ballroom with a coffered ceiling.  They designed a new building, the ''Pavillon des Poeles'',  to contain the new apartments of the King.  The painters Primaticcio and Niccol\u00f2 dell'Abbate continued their decoration of the new ballroom and the gallery of Ulysses with murals by Primaticcio framed in ornately sculptured stucco.<ref name=\"Salmon, p 9\">Salmon, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Other ch\u00e2teaux of Fran\u00e7ois I period===\nFran\u00e7ois I began other chateaux in the Paris region,  The biggest and most impressive was the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid]], in what is now the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], which he began in 1527, because he found the Louvre uncomfortable. It was largely abandoned and then demolished in the late 18th century.  Another late ch\u00e2teau created by Fran\u00e7ois I is the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. The facade was entirely redone and, unlike the earlier ch\u00e2teaux, it was given an Italianate flat terrace roof lined with large stone vases with an emerging caved flame. Other notable ch\u00e2teaux of this period include the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Ancy-le-Franc]] (1538\u20131546) in Burgundy.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|pages=218\u2013224}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye01.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], reconstructed by Fran\u00e7ois I beginning in 1539\nFile:Saint-Germain-en-Laye Ch\u00e2teau Vieux 2011 081.jpg|Decoration of the portal of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]\nFile:Bastiments v1 (Gregg 1972 p34) - Madrid front facade.jpg|Facade of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid]], begun 1527, completed 1552, demolished 1792\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Second period \u2013 Classical influence==\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe second period of French Renaissance architecture commenced in about 1540, late in the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, and continued until the death of his successor [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559.  This period is sometimes described as the high point of the style.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=159}} It included work by Italian architects including [[Giacomo Vignola]] and [[Sebastiano Serlio]], but more and more it was made by French architects,  particularly [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Pierre Lescot]] and [[Jean Bullant]], and by the sculptor [[Jean Goujon]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}}\n\nThe features of this period included the greater use of the ancient [[Classical order]]s of columns and pilasters, preceding from the most massive to the lightest.  This meant starting at the bottom with the [[Doric order]], then the [[Ionic order|Ionic]], then the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] on top.  The order used on each level determined the style of that level of the facade. Philibert Delorme went further and added two new orders to his facades:  French Doric and French Ionic. These columns were regular Doric and Ionic columns decorated with ornamental bands or rings.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}}\n\nThe second period featured also a wide variety of decorative plaques and sculptural decoration on the facades, usually borrowed from ancient Greek or Roman models.  These included the [[caryatide]], elaborate [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]],  ''renomm\u00e9es'', relief statues representing [[Pheme|Fame]], over doorways, ''grotesques'', often in the form of [[satyrs]] and [[griffin|griffons]], and sculpted draperies and garlands.  They also often included stylized monograms of the initials of the owner.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=88}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Character of Renaissance Architecture 0250.jpg|Doorway design by [[Philibert Delorme]]\nFile:Character of Renaissance Architecture 0245.jpg|French [[Doric order]] column by [[Philibert Delorme]] \nFile:Androuet du Cerceau, Jacques I 1560 Fontaine des Saints Innocents \u00e0 Paris - Gallica 2014.jpg|Plan of the [[Fontaine des Innocents]] by [[Philibert Delorme]] (1547\u20131550)\nFile:Fontaine des Innocents reliefs.

It originally had three wings, a chapel and a large garden, as well as an imposing gatehouse, whose centerpiece was the famous Nymph statue by [[Cellini]], now at Fontainebleau, along with sculptures of a stag and two hunting dogs.  The porch of the main facade was also a striking innovation; it was the first correct use in France of the three classical orders, one above the other.  Only a few of the original buildings remain.  The central building was later demolished, but the porch can be seen today in the courtyard of the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.  A third innovative feature was the chapel, consecrated in 1553. In his plan, Delorme combined the forms of the square, the [[Greek cross]] and the circle.  The dome had a spiral coffered interior, resembling those in ancient Rome; it  was one of the first of its kind in France.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=233}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Collection- A.

The project was undertaken by [[Pierre Lescot]], a nobleman and architect, and was modified by the new King, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], who added a new pavilion on the southwest to serve as his residence.  The result was a skillful blend of Italian and French elements.  The facade featured arcades on the ground level in the Italian style, and was divided by three ''avant-corps'' decorated with sets of twin Corinthian columns and topped with consoles with rounded frontons.  These vertical elements were balanced by the strong horizontal bands marking the floors, and by the gradual and subtle change of the ornament on each level, representing the three classical orders of architecture. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=90}}  To avoid monotony, the frontons of the windows alternated between triangles and rounded arches. The top floor did not have a high roof ''lucarnes'', like most other French Renaissance buildings; it was composed instead of alternating windows and sculptural decoration, beneath a new kind of roof, the called a ''comble bris\u00e9'', which had two different angles of slope.  It was crowned with a ridge of ornament.{{Sfn|Mignon|1917|page=230}}\n\nThe sculptural decoration on the facade, by [[Jean Goujon]] was especially remarkable.  On the two lower levels, it was discreet, composed of inlays of polychrome marble and [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] with sculpted garlands. However, on the attic or top floor, he lavishly covered every part of the wall with sculptures of slaves, warriors, trophies, and mythical divinities, representing in classical style the military triumphs of France.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=90}}\n\nInside the [[Lescot Wing]] the decoration was inspired by ancient Greece.  In the ballroom, the balcony for the musicians was carried by [[caryatide]]s made by Jean Goujon, inspired by those on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in Athens. Goujon was also responsible for the coffered ceiling of the right stairway of the Lescot Wing, decorated with a sculpture of hunting scenes.{{Sfn|Mignon|1917|page=231}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bastiments v1 (Gregg 1972 p20) - Louvre west wing court facade.jpg|Lescot's facade as illustrated in ''Les plus excellents b\u00e2timents de France'' (1576)\nFile:Paris 75001 Cour Carr\u00e9e Louvre Aile Lescot 01a frontal.jpg|West facade of the [[Lescot Wing]]\nFile:Paris Palais du Louvre Salle des Caryatides tribune 20161031.jpg|[[Caryatides]] supporting the musical tribune by [[Jean Goujon]]\nFile:Escalera de Enrique II.

As one of the first manifestations of the French classicism, its exceptionals ornementation and pristine condition earn it a mention in every overview of French Renaissance<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\">Explanatory comments of ''Toulouse Renaissance'' exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.</ref>.\n\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat, a wealthy [[Isatis tinctoria|woad merchant]], launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), take their inspiration from the great classical models such as the [[Coliseum]]. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]]\u2014expresses order and regularity<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>.\n\nAfter Bachelier's death in 1557 the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to Mannerist architecture<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bachelier_-_H\u00f4tel_d'Ass\u00e9zat_-_Toulouse.jpg|The courtyard and the staircase tower (1555-1557)\nFile:Assezat-colonnes-jumelles.jpg|Fluted and rudented columns\nFile:Chapiteaux-assezat.jpg|Doric, Ionic and Corinthian capitals\nFile:Assezat-Serlio.jpg|Influence of an engraving by [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]]\nFile:Assezat-02(12).jpg|The main gate\n</gallery>\n\n==Religious architecture==\nThe Renaissance had less influence on French religious architecture; cathedrals and churches, for the most part, continued to be built or rebuilt in the [[Flamboyant]] [[French Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].  However, a few classical elements introduced during the Renaissance appeared in churches.  Examples include the classical portals of the churches of [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], directly across from the new Lescot Wing of the Louvre, and [[Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs]] in Paris. The latter was borrowed directly from the Palace of Tournelles, designed by [[Philibert de l'Orme|Philibert Delorme]].  The church of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131552), near the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]] in Paris, has a Gothic choir, but a facade with a classical pediment, balustrades with classical columns a remarkable [[rood]], or bridge, crossing the nave. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24\u201325}}\n\nThe Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris]] (1532\u20131640), in the center of Paris, was begun by [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and is second in size only to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] among Paris churches.  It is a hybrid of Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance styles. The  exterior, plan and vaulted ceiling are Gothic, but the orders of classical columns and other Renaissance elements appear in the interior.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24\u201325}}\n\nOne of the finest religious monuments of the French Renaissance is the tomb of Fran\u00e7ois I and his wife Claude de France, located within the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] (1547\u20131561).  It was created by the architect Philibert Delorme and the sculptor [[Pierre Bontemps]].  The principal element is a triumphal arch, modeled after the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome,  crowned with four statues of fame, as well as the King and Queen. The vault of the arch and the entablement are richly decorated with sculptural decoration of olive leaves and other classical themes, and with tablets of black and white marble. The tall, slender columns give the tomb an exceptional lightness and grace.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=94}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Church Saint Eustache, Paris (interior).jpg|Interior of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], Paris \nFile:St-Etienne-du-Mont Interior 3, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|[[Rood]] screen of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131545)\nFile:P1020129 Paris V Eglise Saint-Etienne-du-Mont fa\u00e7ade reductwk.JPG|Facade with classical orders of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont]] (1530\u20131552) in Paris\nFile:Francois-1-Claude-de-France2.jpg|Tomb of Fran\u00e7ois I and Claude of France (c. 1547\u201361) \nFile:P1340838 Paris III eglise St-Nicolas-des-champs portail sud rwk.jpg|South portal of [[Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs]] (1559) in Paris\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Last projects==\nAfter the death of King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], France was torn by the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]], which largely pushed aside architecture and design.  Nonetheless, a few last Renaissance projects were launched, largely inspired by [[Catherine de Medici]], the widow of Henry II.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}  The most important project of the period was the new [[Tuileries Palace]].  It was designed by the chief royal architect, Philibert Delorme, in response to the Queen's wish for a modern palace with a large park on what was then the edge of the city. It featured a central pavilion with low wings composed of arcades topped by a residential floor with alternating [[dormer]] windows triangular frontons.  All the facades lavishly decorated in the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance style]], including elongated sculpted figures inspired by the works of [[Michelangelo]].  After the death of Delorme in 1570, the task was taken up by [[Jean Bullant]], but then it was interrupted again by the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, and was not completed until decades later. The decorations invented by Delorme included a new style of classical columns, French Corinthian, banded with several ornamental rings.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}\n\nCatherine de Medici also imposed the Italian style at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], with the construction of a new wing, the ''Aile de la Belle Chimin\u00e9e'' (wing of the beautiful chimney). The facade was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and featured a combination of Italian and French elements; pilasters, statues in niches, a high roof with lucarnes, a central [[Frontispiece (architecture)|frontispiece]] resembling Italian church architecture, and two diverging stairways.\n\nThe second plan of the Ch\u00e2teau de Verneuil (since demolished) by the young architect [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1576) was another landmark of the late French Renaissance style. It was commanded by [[Henry IV of France]].  Its symmetry, corner pavilions, twin pilasters, discreet roof, absence of lucarnes and its rotunda at the entrance made it a concise summary of the French Renaissance style at the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Mignon|2017|page=234\u2013235}}\n\nCatherine de Medici also commissioned additions to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]].  The bridge over the [[Cher (river)|Cher river]] had been built by Philibert Delorme. After his death in 1570, Catherine asked Jean Bullant to built a picturesque gallery (1576) atop the bridge. A much larger ensemble of buildings around the bridge was planned by Bullant, but was never built.{{Sfn|Mignon|2017}} \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fontainebleau Ch\u00e2teau 534.jpg|The Wing of the Belle Chemin\u00e9e of the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]], by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1559\u20131600)\nFile:Chateau de Chenonceau 2008E.jpg|Bridge of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]] by Philibert Delorme and then Jean Bullant (1576)\nFile:Bastiments v1 (Gregg 1972 p78) - Verneuil bird's-eye view entrance front second design.jpg|Design for the Ch\u00e2teau de Verneuil by [[Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] (1576)\nFile:Character of Renaissance Architecture 0244.jpg|Facade design for garden wing of [[Tuileries Palace]] designed by Philibert Delorme\nFile:Dom Michel Felibien 001.jpg|The later plan of Jean Bullant for a pavilion of the Tuileries Palace\nFile:Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro @ Paris (30590456573).jpg|Fragment of Delorme's garden wing of the Tuileries Palace, now in the garden of the [[Palais de Chaillot]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat|Renaissance architecture in France}}\n* [[Renaissance architecture]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teauesque]]\n*[[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Ducher|first=Robert|title=Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles|year=1988|language=fr|publisher=Flammarion|ISBN=2-08-011539-1|ref={{sfnref|Ducher|1988}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mignon|first=Olivier|title=Architecture du Patrimoine Fran\u00e7ais - Ch\u00e2teaux de la Renaissance|publisher=\u00c9ditions Ouest-France|year=2017|language=fr|ISBN=978-2-7373-7611-5|ref={{SfnRef|Mignon|2017}}}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Renault|first1=Christophe|last2=Laz\u00e9|first2=Christophe|title=Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier|year=2006|language=fr|publisher=Gisserot|isbn=9-782877-474658|ref={{sfnref|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Salmon|first=Xavier|title=Fontainebleau- Vrai demeure des rois, maison des si\u00e8cles|year=2011|publisher=Artlys|location=Versailles|language=fr|ISBN=978-2-85495-442-5}}\n*{{cite book|last=Texier|first=Simon|title=Paris - panorama de l'architecture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 \u00e0 nos jours|year=2012|publisher=Parigramme|location=Paris|language=fr|isbn=978-2-84096-667-8}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Litoux|first=Emmanuel|title=Congr\u00e8s Arch\u00e9ologique de France|year=2003|language=fr|publisher=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Arch\u00e9ologie|isbn=|location=Paris|ref={{sfnref|Congr\u00e8s arch\u00e9ologique|2003}}}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:French Renaissance Architecture}}\n[[Category:Renaissance architecture in France| ]]\n[[Category:French Renaissance|*]]\n[[Category:French architecture by period|R]]\n[[Category:Renaissance architecture by country|France]]\n[[Category:15th-century architecture]]\n[[Category:16th-century architecture]]\n[[Category:17th-century architecture]]\n[[Category:Architecture of France|R]]\n", "name_user": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Neupont", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eH\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat (1555\u20131557 and 1560's):changed a picture for an english version", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Renaissance_architecture"}
