Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti Americans|Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"Almaas\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond.\" \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] or an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Biography ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. At the age of eighteen, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Hameed was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[http://www.ridhwan.org/school/involved.html Ridhwan School \u2013 How to get Involved]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''tan tien''). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free.

Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti Americans|Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"Almaas\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond.\" \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] or an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Biography ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. At the age of eighteen, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Hameed was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[http://www.ridhwan.org/school/involved.html Ridhwan School \u2013 How to get Involved]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''tan tien''). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 http://www.ridhwan.org/school/school.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

A large portion of the population works outside of Jersey County and benefits from being \"Near the crowd, but not in it.\", the official slogan of the [http://www.jerseycounty.org/ Jersey County Business Association's] advertising campaign. The bordering rivers play an important part in Jersey County's economy by supporting agricultural producers and [[agribusiness]], and by creating a strong tourist market. Education, manufacturing, and retail are also among the county's largest industries.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|377|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|369|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.9|sqmi}} (2.1%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/> Jersey County is bordered by three bodies of water: the [[Mississippi River]] to the south, the [[Illinois River]] to the west, and [[Macoupin Creek]] to the northwest.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Jerseyville, Illinois]]\n|17|35|1.92\n|22|41|2.01\n|32|53|3.51\n|42|64|4.14\n|52|74|3.95\n|61|83|3.68\n|66|88|3.51\n|63|86|2.91\n|55|79|3.23\n|43|68|2.86\n|34|53|3.77\n|23|40|2.82\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0588\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Jerseyville, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\n\nTypically, the county's climate reflects most [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] areas, located in the transitional zone between the [[humid continental climate]] type and the [[humid subtropical climate]] type ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa'' and ''Cfa'', respectively), with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. Spring is the wettest season and produces severe weather ranging from tornadoes to snow or ice storms. Summers are hot and humid, and the humidity often makes the [[heat index]] rise to temperatures feeling well above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first [[snow flurry|snow flurries]] usually forming in late November. Winters can be cold at times with periodic light snow and temperatures below freezing.\n\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Jerseyville have ranged from a low of {{convert|17|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|88|\u00b0F}} in July. The record low temperature of {{convert|-25|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and the record high temperature of {{convert|112|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

Dewey]]. Between 1948 and 2004, Jersey County became something of a [[bellwether]] county, voting for every winning Presidential candidate except in the Catholicism-influenced 1960 election, and that of 1988 which was heavily influenced by [[1988\u201389 North American drought|a major Midwestern drought]]. Disagreement with the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal views on social issues since the 1990s has caused a powerful swing back to the Republicans in the past quarter-century.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.

The area quickly evolved into several small agricultural communities. As the area soon began to flourish, a county government was established and a courthouse was built in Jerseyville, the county seat. The Jersey County Courthouse was designed by architect Henry Elliott who also designed the courthouses in nearby [[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]], [[Edgar County, Illinois]], [[DeWitt County, Illinois]] (later demolished in 1987) and [[Pike County, Illinois]]. The cornerstone for the courthouse was laid on July 4, 1893. The Romanesque Revival style courthouse is a magnificent architectural structure of limestone quarried from the nearby town of Grafton, Illinois.\n<gallery>\nFile:Jersey County Illinois 1839.png|Jersey County at the time of its creation in 1839\n</gallery>\n\n===Recent history===\nToday, while the county maintains its agricultural base, it is also within commuting distance of jobs and industry in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and the surrounding area.  A large portion of the population works outside of Jersey County and benefits from being \"Near the crowd, but not in it.\", the official slogan of the [http://www.jerseycounty.org/ Jersey County Business Association's] advertising campaign. The bordering rivers play an important part in Jersey County's economy by supporting agricultural producers and [[agribusiness]], and by creating a strong tourist market.

Spring is the wettest season and produces severe weather ranging from tornadoes to snow or ice storms. Summers are hot and humid, and the humidity often makes the [[heat index]] rise to temperatures feeling well above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first [[snow flurry|snow flurries]] usually forming in late November. Winters can be cold at times with periodic light snow and temperatures below freezing.\n\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Jerseyville have ranged from a low of {{convert|17|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|88|\u00b0F}} in July.

It voted solidly Democratic until [[Warren G. Harding]] carried the county in his record 1920 landslide. It voted Republican again in [[Herbert Hoover]]\u2019s landslide of 1920 and 1928, but otherwise was firmly Democratic until [[World War II]], when opposition to US involvement turned the county to [[Wendell Willkie]] and then [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. Between 1948 and 2004, Jersey County became something of a [[bellwether]] county, voting for every winning Presidential candidate except in the Catholicism-influenced 1960 election, and that of 1988 which was heavily influenced by [[1988\u201389 North American drought|a major Midwestern drought]]. Disagreement with the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal views on social issues since the 1990s has caused a powerful swing back to the Republicans in the past quarter-century.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.

A resident of Paris for most of his adult life, he wrote in both French and English.\n\nBeckett's work offers a bleak, [[Tragicomedy|tragi-comic]] outlook on human existence, often coupled with [[black comedy]] and gallows humour, and became increasingly [[Minimalism|minimalist]] in his later career. He is considered one of the last [[Modernism|modernist]] writers, and one of the key figures in what [[Martin Esslin]] called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\".<ref>Cakirtas, O.

Beckett had one older brother, Frank Edward Beckett (1902\u20131954). At the age of five, Beckett attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School in Dublin city centre near Harcourt Street. The Becketts were members of the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. The family home, Cooldrinagh in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Foxrock]], was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Samuel's father, William. The house and garden, together with the surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby [[Leopardstown Racecourse]], the Foxrock railway station and Harcourt Street station at the city terminus of the line, all feature in his prose and plays.\n\nIn 1919/1920, Beckett went to [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], County Fermanagh (which [[Oscar Wilde]] had also attended). He left three years later, in 1923. A natural athlete, Beckett excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he was to play for [[Dublin University Cricket Club|Dublin University]] and played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"wisden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/player/24553.html|title=Samuel Beckett|website=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played [[first-class cricket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154150.html|title=Never a famous cricketer|last=Rice|first=Jonathan|year=2001|website=Wisden|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early writings==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Walk Samuel Beckett, Paris (France) - Philippe Binant Archives.JPG|thumb|Samuel Beckett Walk, Paris (France)]]\n\nBeckett studied French, Italian, and English at [[Trinity College Dublin]] from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the eminent [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] scholar [[A. A. Luce]], who introduced him to the work of [[Henri Bergson]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Colangelo|first1=Jeremy|title=Nothing is Impossible: Bergson, Beckett, and the Pursuit of the Naught|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|year=2017|volume=40|issue=4|page=39|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.4.03|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671605|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>). He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at [[Campbell College]] in Belfast, took up the post of ''lecteur d'anglais'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris from November 1928 to 1930.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski, ''Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'', 161</ref> While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author [[James Joyce]] by [[Thomas MacGreevy]], a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p106.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay entitled \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\".<!-- sic! those periods are correct! See \"An exagmination of James Joyce\", page 3 --> The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (a book of essays in Joyce which also included contributions by [[Eugene Jolas]], [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] owing to her progressing [[schizophrenia]]. Beckett's first short story, \"Assumption\", was published in Jolas's periodical [[Transition (literary journal)|''transition'']]. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem \"Whoroscope\", which draws on a biography of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.\n\nIn 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the [[Toulouse]] poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called ''le Concentrisme''. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be \"at odds with all that is clear and distinct in [[Descartes]]\". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience.<ref>C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 2004), 108.</ref> When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem \"Gnome\", which was inspired by his reading of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and eventually published in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' in 1934:\n\n{{quote|Spend the years of learning squandering<br/>Courage for the years of wandering<br/>Through a world politely turning<br/>From the loutishness of learning<ref>\"Gnome\" from ''Collected Poems''</ref>}}\n\nBeckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'', his critical study of French author [[Marcel Proust]]. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with [[Tavistock Clinic]] psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion|Dr. Wilfred Bion]]. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as ''Watt'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.<ref>\n[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/speople.html Beckett, Samuel. (1906\u20131989)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} \u2013 Literary Encyclopedia\n</ref> In 1932, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'', but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 [[Short story|short-story]] collection ''[[More Pricks Than Kicks]]''.\n\nBeckett published essays and reviews, including \"Recent Irish Poetry\" (in ''[[The Bookman (literary magazine)|The Bookman]]'', August 1934) and \"Humanistic Quietism\", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's ''Poems'' (in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', July\u2013September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, [[Brian Coffey]], [[Denis Devlin]] and [[Blanaid Salkeld]], despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their [[Celtic Revival]] contemporaries and invoking [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|French symbolists]] as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming \"the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland\", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic [[Modernism|modernist]] canon.<ref>''Disjecta'', 76</ref>\n\nIn 1935\u2014the year that he successfully published a book of his poetry, ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates''\u2014Beckett worked on his novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production.  In 1936, a friend had suggested he look up the works of [[Arnold Geulincx]], which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in ''Murphy'' and the reading apparently left a strong impression.<ref>The notes that Beckett took have been published and commented in ''Notes de Beckett sur Geulincx'' (2012) ed. N. Doutey, Paris: Les Solitaires Intempestifs, {{ISBN|978-2-84681-350-1}} and ''Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes'', ed. H. Van Ruler, Brill Academic Publishers {{ISBN|9789004154674}}.</ref> ''Murphy'' was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of ''Murphy'' (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, \"France at war to Ireland at peace\".<ref>Israel Shenker, \"Moody Man of Letters\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 May 1956; quoted in Cronin, 310</ref> His was soon a known face in and around [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] caf\u00e9s, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], with whom he regularly played [[chess]]. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who nicknamed him \"Oblomov\" (after the character in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s [[Oblomov|novel]]).<ref>This character, she said, was so looed by apathia that he \"finally did not even have the willpower to get out of bed\"; quoted in Gussow (1989).</ref>\n\nIn January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious [[pimp]] (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], who knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: \"Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse\" [\"I do not know, sir. I'm sorry\"].<ref>Knowlson (1997) p261</ref> Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker\u2014partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.\n\n==World War II and French Resistance==\nAfter the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the [[French Resistance]], in which he worked as a courier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Lettres4|title=Lettres \u2013 Blanche \u2013 GALLIMARD \u2013 Site Gallimard|website=gallimard.fr}}</ref> On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the [[Gestapo]]. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of [[Roussillon, Vaucluse|Roussillon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''d\u00e9partement'' in [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p304\u2013305</ref>\n\nBeckett was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945|Croix de guerre]] and the [[M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance]] by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as \"boy scout stuff\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=The Modern Word |publisher=The Modern Word |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014  }}</ref><ref>Knowlson (1997) p303</ref> While in hiding in Roussillon, he continued work on the novel [[Watt (novel)|''Watt'']] (begun in 1941 and completed in 1945, but not published until 1953, though an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|''Envoy'']]).\n\n==Fame: novels and the theatre==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Samuel Beckett by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], painted in Paris, 1961 (from the collection of Ken White, Dublin).]]\nIn 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother's room: his entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never beat him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:\n<blockquote>\"I realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, as related by James Knowlson in his biography.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKnowlson argues that \"Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss \u2013 as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'\"<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\"/> The revelation \"has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career\". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say \"clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...\", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are \"precious ally\".<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\">Knowlson (1997) p352\u2013353.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]\u2019s magazine ''Les Temps modernes'' published the first part of Beckett's short story \"''Suite''\" (later to be called \"''La Fin''\", or \"The End\"), not realising that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, [[Mercier and Camier|''Mercier et Camier'']], which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett's first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lindon]], director of his Parisian publishing house [[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit]], including the [[poioumenon]] \"trilogy\" of novels: [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951); ''Malone meurt'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1958); ''L'innommable'' (1953), ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because\u2014as he himself claimed\u2014it was easier for him thus to write \"without style\".<ref>Knowlson (1997) p324</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Beckett 01-2.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Portrait, circa 1970]]\nBeckett is most famous for his play ''[[Waiting for Godot|En attendant Godot]]'' (1953) (''[[Waiting for Godot]]''). Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p342</ref> His partner, [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], was integral to its success. Dechevaux-Dumesnil became his agent and sent the manuscript to multiple producers until they met [[Roger Blin]], the soon-to-be director of the play. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bair |first1=Deirdre |authorlink1=Deirdre Bair |editor1-last=Weintraub |editor1-first=Stanley |title=Samuel (Barclay) Beckett |journal=Dictionary of Literary Biography |year=1982 |volume=13 |url=http://0-link.galegroup.com.mercury.concordia.ca/apps/doc/H1200002423/LitRC?u=concordi_main&sid=LitRC&xid=b10e1355 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit}}</ref>\n\nBlin's knowledge of French theatre and vision alongside Beckett knowing what he wanted the play to represent contributed greatly to its success. In a much-quoted article, the critic [[Vivian Mercier]] wrote that Beckett \"has achieved a theoretical impossibility\u2014a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.\"<ref>''[[Irish Times]]'', 18 February 1956, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> The play was published in 1952 and premi\u00e8red in 1953 in Paris; an English translation was performed two years later. The play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and, later, [[Kenneth Tynan]]. After the showing in Miami, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. The play is a favourite: it is not only performed frequently but has globally inspired playwrights to emulate it.<ref name=\"auto\">Bair (1982), p13</ref> This is the sole play the manuscript of which Beckett never sold, donated or gave away.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He refused to allow the play to be translated into film but did allow it to be played on television.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ackerley |first1=C.J. |last2=Gontarski |first2=S.E. |title=The Grove companion to Samuel Beckett : a reader's guide to his works, life, and thought |date=2004 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0802140491 |page=622 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBeckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of ''Molloy'', for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of ''Waiting for Godot'' opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including ''Fin de partie'' (''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'') (1957), ''Krapp's Last Tape'' (1958, written in English), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961, also written in English), and ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with [[Jorge Luis Borges]].\n\n== Later life and death ==\n[[File:Beckett-grave-paris.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Samuel Beckett at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]].]] \nThe 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the [[BBC Third Programme]] for a radio play, ''[[All That Fall]].'' He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life.\n\nBeckett bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around {{convert|60|km|mi|-1}} northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.\n\nFrom the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with [[Barbara Bray]], a widow who worked as a script editor for the [[BBC]]. Knowlson wrote of them: \"She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.\"<ref>Knowlson (1997) p458-9.</ref> Barbara Bray died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 February 2010.\n[[File:\"Samuel Beckett\" by Javad Alizadeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Samuel Beckett by [[Javad Alizadeh]]]]\nIn October 1969 while on holiday in [[Tunis]] with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a \"catastrophe\".<ref>Knowlson (1998) p505.</ref> While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM St. Jacques in Paris near his [[Montparnasse]] home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=Happiest moment of the past half million: Beckett Biography |publisher=Themodernword.com |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014  }}</ref> Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster in 15 December 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'' reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.<ref>{{cite news | last = Foster | first = Roy | title = Darkness and Kindness | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97767/beckett-letters-godot-ireland?passthru=YWEzNjliOWUzNTZhNGRmNGQ4MDMwZmNkOTVjYmY2M2E | work = The New Republic | date = 15 December 2011 | accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from [[emphysema]] and possibly [[Parkinson's disease]], Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]] in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be \"any colour, so long as it's grey\".\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett by Edmund S. Valtman ppmsc.07951.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature of Beckett by [[Edmund S. Valtman]]]]\nBeckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more [[Minimalism|minimalist]].\n\n===Early works===\nBeckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection ''[[More Pricks than Kicks]]'' (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:\n\n<blockquote>It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.<ref>''More Pricks than Kicks'', 9</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe passage makes reference to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'', which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.\n\nSimilar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, ''Murphy'' (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and [[Black comedy|black]] [[Gallows humor|humour]] that animate many of Beckett's works: \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\".<ref>''Murphy'', 1</ref> ''Watt'', written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a [[permutation|mathematical permutation]], presaging Beckett's later preoccupation\u2014in both his novels and dramatic works\u2014with precise movement.\n\nBeckett's 1930 essay ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'' was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness\u2014in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates'' (1935)\u2014seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in ''Watt''.\n\n===Middle period===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote  =<poem>\nwho may tell the tale\nof the old man?\nweigh absence in a scale?\nmete want with a span?\nthe sum assess\nof the world's woes?\nnothingness\nin words enclose?\n</poem> |source =From ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' (1953)<ref>''Watt'' by Beckett quoted in: Booth, Wayne C. (1975)  A rhetoric of irony By Wayne C. Booth Chicago University Press p258 {{ISBN|0-226-06553-7}}</ref>}}\nAfter World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the \"revelation\" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin\u2014in which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world\u2014that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.\n\nDuring the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: ''En attendant Godot'' (written 1948\u20131949; ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), ''Fin de partie'' (1955\u20131957; ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''), ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958), and ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961). These plays\u2014which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\"\u2014deal in a [[black comedy|darkly humorous]] way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary [[existentialism|existentialist thinkers]]. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and ''Godot'' were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of [[Albert Camus]]'s concept of \"the absurd\";<ref>Esslin (1969).</ref> this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded [[absurdism|his own philosophy]]). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell\u2014one of the two characters in ''Endgame'' who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak\u2014can best summarise the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.\"<ref>''Endgame'', 18\u201319</ref>\n\nBeckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). In these novels\u2014sometimes referred to as a \"trilogy\", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes\u2014the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004) p586</ref> ''Molloy'', for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a [[detective novel]]. In ''Malone Dies'', movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the \"action\" of the book takes the form of an [[Inner monologue|interior monologue]]. Finally, in ''The Unnamable'', almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of ''The Unnamable'': 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.<ref>''Three Novels'', 414</ref>\n\nAfter these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief \"stories\" later collected as ''Texts for Nothing''. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, ''Comment c'est'' (1961; ''How It Is''). An early variant version of ''Comment c'est'', ''L'Image'', was published in the British arts review, [[X (magazine)|''X: A Quarterly Review'']] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.<ref>\"L\u2019Image\", X: A Quarterly Review, ed. [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] & [[Patrick Swift]], Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959 [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/beckett/career/howitis/publications.html Beckett Exhibition Harry Ransom Centre University of Texas at Austin]</ref>). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching [[telegraphese]]: \"You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark\"<ref>''How It Is'', 22</ref> Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. ''How It Is'' is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.\n\n===Late works===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |lleft|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote  =<poem>\ntime she stopped\nsitting at her window\nquiet at her window\nonly window\nfacing other windows\nother only windows\nall eyes\nall sides\nhigh and low\ntime she stopped\n</poem> |source =From ''Rockaby'' (1980) }}\nThroughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency\u2014already evident in much of his work of the 1950s\u2014towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as [[minimalism|minimalist]]. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', the theatrical [[revue]] for which it served as an introductory piece).<ref>Knowlson (1997) p501</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Beckett DCP 1341.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]]]\nIn his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters\u2014already few in number in the earlier plays\u2014are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama ''[[Eh Joe]]'' (1963), which was written for the actor [[Jack MacGowran]], is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play ''[[Not I]]'' (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, \"a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness\".<ref>Quoted in Knowlson (1997) p522</ref> Following from ''Krapp's Last Tape'', many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in ''Eh Joe'') or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in ''Not I''). Beckett's most politically charged play, ''[[Catastrophe (play)|Catastrophe]]'' (1982), which was dedicated to [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of ''mirlitonnades'', with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including [[Derek Mahon]], have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.\n\nBeckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts ''Fizzles'' (which the American artist [[Jasper Johns]] illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' (1980), which continued with ''[[Ill Seen Ill Said]]'' (1982) and ''[[Worstward Ho]]'' (1984), later collected in ''[[Nohow On]]''. In these three \"'closed space' stories,\"<ref>''Nohow On'', vii</ref> Beckett continued his pre-occupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of ''Company'' make clear: \"A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.\" \"To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said.\"<ref>''Nohow On'', 3</ref> Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''.\n\nIn the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem \"What is the Word\" (\"Comment dire\"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.\n\n==Collaborators==\n\n===Jack MacGowran===\n[[Jack MacGowran]] was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted ''End of Day'' in Dublin in 1962, revising it as ''Beginning To End'' (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970\u20131971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as ''Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.'' Beckett wrote the radio play ''[[Embers]]'' and the teleplay ''[[Eh Joe]]'' specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]],'' and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, ''MacGowran Speaking Beckett'' for [[Claddagh Records]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claddaghrecords.com/index.php/jack-macgowran-macgowran-speaking-beckett.html|title=Jack MacGowran \u2013 MacGowran Speaking Beckett}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|title=Big City Books \u2013 First Editions, Rare, Fanzines, Music Memorabilia \u2013 contact|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010607/http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|archivedate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Billie Whitelaw===\n[[Billie Whitelaw]] worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as ''[[Not I]]'', ''[[Eh Joe]]'', ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]].'' She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography ''Billie Whitelaw...: Who He?,'' she describes their first meeting in 1963 as \"trust at first sight\". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the \"supreme interpreter of his work\", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in ''[[Not I]]''. She said of the play ''Rockaby'': \"I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing ''Happy Days'' and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section.

He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]], praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works' critical refusal of simplicities; others such as [[Georg Luk\u00e1cs]] condemned him for 'decadent' lack of [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref>Adorno, Theodor W.

The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licences to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.\n\nHistorians interested in tracing Beckett's blood line were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his [[DNA]] to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.\n\nSome of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer [[John Minihan (photographer)|John Minihan]], who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century.<ref>1998  ''The Royal Academy'' Magazine, the \"Image of the century\"</ref> It was the theatre photographer John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography, for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett's work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhaynesphotography.com/ |title=Photographer John Haynes's website |publisher=Johnhaynesphotography.com |accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>\n[[An Post]], the Irish postal service, issued a [[List of people on stamps of Ireland|commemorative stamp]] of Beckett in 1994.\nThe [[Central Bank of Ireland]] launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)|commemorative coins]] on 26 April 2006: \u20ac10 Silver Coin and \u20ac20 Gold Coin.\n\nOn 10 December 2009, the new bridge across the [[River Liffey]] in Dublin was opened and named the [[Samuel Beckett Bridge]] in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side, it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who had also designed the [[James Joyce Bridge]] situated further upstream and opened on [[Bloomsday]] (16 June) 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Beckett's niece Caroline Murphy, his nephew Edward Beckett, poet [[Seamus Heaney]] and [[Barry McGovern]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1211/breaking4.htm|title=Samuel Beckett Bridge opens}}</ref>\nThe newest ship of the [[Irish Naval Service]], the [[L\u00c9 Samuel Beckett (P61)|L\u00c9 ''Samuel Beckett'' (P61)]], is named for Beckett.

A resident of Paris for most of his adult life, he wrote in both French and English.\n\nBeckett's work offers a bleak, [[Tragicomedy|tragi-comic]] outlook on human existence, often coupled with [[black comedy]] and gallows humour, and became increasingly [[Minimalism|minimalist]] in his later career. He is considered one of the last [[Modernism|modernist]] writers, and one of the key figures in what [[Martin Esslin]] called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\".<ref>Cakirtas, O.

Beckett had one older brother, Frank Edward Beckett (1902\u20131954). At the age of five, Beckett attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School in Dublin city centre near Harcourt Street. The Becketts were members of the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. The family home, Cooldrinagh in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Foxrock]], was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Samuel's father, William. The house and garden, together with the surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby [[Leopardstown Racecourse]], the Foxrock railway station and Harcourt Street station at the city terminus of the line, all feature in his prose and plays.\n\nIn 1919/1920, Beckett went to [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], County Fermanagh (which [[Oscar Wilde]] had also attended). He left three years later, in 1923. A natural athlete, Beckett excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he was to play for [[Dublin University Cricket Club|Dublin University]] and played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"wisden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/player/24553.html|title=Samuel Beckett|website=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played [[first-class cricket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154150.html|title=Never a famous cricketer|last=Rice|first=Jonathan|year=2001|website=Wisden|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early writings==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Walk Samuel Beckett, Paris (France) - Philippe Binant Archives.JPG|thumb|Samuel Beckett Walk, Paris (France)]]\n\nBeckett studied French, Italian, and English at [[Trinity College Dublin]] from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the eminent [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] scholar [[A. A. Luce]], who introduced him to the work of [[Henri Bergson]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Colangelo|first1=Jeremy|title=Nothing is Impossible: Bergson, Beckett, and the Pursuit of the Naught|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|year=2017|volume=40|issue=4|page=39|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.4.03|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671605|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>). He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at [[Campbell College]] in Belfast, took up the post of ''lecteur d'anglais'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris from November 1928 to 1930.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski, ''Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'', 161</ref> While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author [[James Joyce]] by [[Thomas MacGreevy]], a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p106.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay entitled \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\".<!-- sic! those periods are correct! See \"An exagmination of James Joyce\", page 3 --> The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (a book of essays in Joyce which also included contributions by [[Eugene Jolas]], [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] owing to her progressing [[schizophrenia]]. Beckett's first short story, \"Assumption\", was published in Jolas's periodical [[Transition (literary journal)|''transition'']]. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem \"Whoroscope\", which draws on a biography of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.\n\nIn 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the [[Toulouse]] poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called ''le Concentrisme''. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be \"at odds with all that is clear and distinct in [[Descartes]]\". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience.<ref>C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 2004), 108.</ref> When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem \"Gnome\", which was inspired by his reading of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and eventually published in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' in 1934:\n\n{{quote|Spend the years of learning squandering<br/>Courage for the years of wandering<br/>Through a world politely turning<br/>From the loutishness of learning<ref>\"Gnome\" from ''Collected Poems''</ref>}}\n\nBeckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'', his critical study of French author [[Marcel Proust]]. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with [[Tavistock Clinic]] psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion|Dr. Wilfred Bion]]. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as ''Watt'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.<ref>\n[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/speople.html Beckett, Samuel. (1906\u20131989)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} \u2013 Literary Encyclopedia\n</ref> In 1932, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'', but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 [[Short story|short-story]] collection ''[[More Pricks Than Kicks]]''.\n\nBeckett published essays and reviews, including \"Recent Irish Poetry\" (in ''[[The Bookman (literary magazine)|The Bookman]]'', August 1934) and \"Humanistic Quietism\", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's ''Poems'' (in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', July\u2013September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, [[Brian Coffey]], [[Denis Devlin]] and [[Blanaid Salkeld]], despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their [[Celtic Revival]] contemporaries and invoking [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|French symbolists]] as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming \"the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland\", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic [[Modernism|modernist]] canon.<ref>''Disjecta'', 76</ref>\n\nIn 1935\u2014the year that he successfully published a book of his poetry, ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates''\u2014Beckett worked on his novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production.  In 1936, a friend had suggested he look up the works of [[Arnold Geulincx]], which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in ''Murphy'' and the reading apparently left a strong impression.<ref>The notes that Beckett took have been published and commented in ''Notes de Beckett sur Geulincx'' (2012) ed. N. Doutey, Paris: Les Solitaires Intempestifs, {{ISBN|978-2-84681-350-1}} and ''Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes'', ed. H. Van Ruler, Brill Academic Publishers {{ISBN|9789004154674}}.</ref> ''Murphy'' was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of ''Murphy'' (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, \"France at war to Ireland at peace\".<ref>Israel Shenker, \"Moody Man of Letters\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 May 1956; quoted in Cronin, 310</ref> His was soon a known face in and around [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] caf\u00e9s, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], with whom he regularly played [[chess]]. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who nicknamed him \"Oblomov\" (after the character in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s [[Oblomov|novel]]).<ref>This character, she said, was so looed by apathia that he \"finally did not even have the willpower to get out of bed\"; quoted in Gussow (1989).</ref>\n\nIn January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious [[pimp]] (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], who knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: \"Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse\" [\"I do not know, sir. I'm sorry\"].<ref>Knowlson (1997) p261</ref> Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker\u2014partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.\n\n==World War II and French Resistance==\nAfter the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the [[French Resistance]], in which he worked as a courier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Lettres4|title=Lettres \u2013 Blanche \u2013 GALLIMARD \u2013 Site Gallimard|website=gallimard.fr}}</ref> On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the [[Gestapo]]. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of [[Roussillon, Vaucluse|Roussillon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''d\u00e9partement'' in [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p304\u2013305</ref>\n\nBeckett was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945|Croix de guerre]] and the [[M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance]] by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as \"boy scout stuff\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=The Modern Word |publisher=The Modern Word |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014  }}</ref><ref>Knowlson (1997) p303</ref> While in hiding in Roussillon, he continued work on the novel [[Watt (novel)|''Watt'']] (begun in 1941 and completed in 1945, but not published until 1953, though an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|''Envoy'']]).\n\n==Fame: novels and the theatre==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Samuel Beckett by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], painted in Paris, 1961 (from the collection of Ken White, Dublin).]]\nIn 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother's room: his entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never beat him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:\n<blockquote>\"I realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, as related by James Knowlson in his biography.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKnowlson argues that \"Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss \u2013 as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'\"<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\"/> The revelation \"has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career\". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say \"clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...\", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are \"precious ally\".<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\">Knowlson (1997) p352\u2013353.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]\u2019s magazine ''Les Temps modernes'' published the first part of Beckett's short story \"''Suite''\" (later to be called \"''La Fin''\", or \"The End\"), not realising that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, [[Mercier and Camier|''Mercier et Camier'']], which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett's first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lindon]], director of his Parisian publishing house [[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit]], including the [[poioumenon]] \"trilogy\" of novels: [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951); ''Malone meurt'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1958); ''L'innommable'' (1953), ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because\u2014as he himself claimed\u2014it was easier for him thus to write \"without style\".<ref>Knowlson (1997) p324</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Beckett 01-2.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Portrait, circa 1970]]\nBeckett is most famous for his play ''[[Waiting for Godot|En attendant Godot]]'' (1953) (''[[Waiting for Godot]]''). Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p342</ref> His partner, [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], was integral to its success. Dechevaux-Dumesnil became his agent and sent the manuscript to multiple producers until they met [[Roger Blin]], the soon-to-be director of the play. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bair |first1=Deirdre |authorlink1=Deirdre Bair |editor1-last=Weintraub |editor1-first=Stanley |title=Samuel (Barclay) Beckett |journal=Dictionary of Literary Biography |year=1982 |volume=13 |url=http://0-link.galegroup.com.mercury.concordia.ca/apps/doc/H1200002423/LitRC?u=concordi_main&sid=LitRC&xid=b10e1355 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit}}</ref>\n\nBlin's knowledge of French theatre and vision alongside Beckett knowing what he wanted the play to represent contributed greatly to its success. In a much-quoted article, the critic [[Vivian Mercier]] wrote that Beckett \"has achieved a theoretical impossibility\u2014a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.\"<ref>''[[Irish Times]]'', 18 February 1956, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> The play was published in 1952 and premi\u00e8red in 1953 in Paris; an English translation was performed two years later. The play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and, later, [[Kenneth Tynan]]. After the showing in Miami, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. The play is a favourite: it is not only performed frequently but has globally inspired playwrights to emulate it.<ref name=\"auto\">Bair (1982), p13</ref> This is the sole play the manuscript of which Beckett never sold, donated or gave away.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He refused to allow the play to be translated into film but did allow it to be played on television.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ackerley |first1=C.J. |last2=Gontarski |first2=S.E. |title=The Grove companion to Samuel Beckett : a reader's guide to his works, life, and thought |date=2004 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0802140491 |page=622 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBeckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of ''Molloy'', for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of ''Waiting for Godot'' opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including ''Fin de partie'' (''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'') (1957), ''Krapp's Last Tape'' (1958, written in English), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961, also written in English), and ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with [[Jorge Luis Borges]].\n\n== Later life and death ==\n[[File:Beckett-grave-paris.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Samuel Beckett at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]].]] \nThe 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the [[BBC Third Programme]] for a radio play, ''[[All That Fall]].'' He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life.\n\nBeckett bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around {{convert|60|km|mi|-1}} northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.\n\nFrom the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with [[Barbara Bray]], a widow who worked as a script editor for the [[BBC]]. Knowlson wrote of them: \"She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.\"<ref>Knowlson (1997) p458-9.</ref> Barbara Bray died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 February 2010.\n[[File:\"Samuel Beckett\" by Javad Alizadeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Samuel Beckett by [[Javad Alizadeh]]]]\nIn October 1969 while on holiday in [[Tunis]] with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a \"catastrophe\".<ref>Knowlson (1998) p505.</ref> While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM St. Jacques in Paris near his [[Montparnasse]] home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=Happiest moment of the past half million: Beckett Biography |publisher=Themodernword.com |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014  }}</ref> Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster in 15 December 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'' reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.<ref>{{cite news | last = Foster | first = Roy | title = Darkness and Kindness | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97767/beckett-letters-godot-ireland?passthru=YWEzNjliOWUzNTZhNGRmNGQ4MDMwZmNkOTVjYmY2M2E | work = The New Republic | date = 15 December 2011 | accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from [[emphysema]] and possibly [[Parkinson's disease]], Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]] in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be \"any colour, so long as it's grey\".\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett by Edmund S. Valtman ppmsc.07951.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature of Beckett by [[Edmund S. Valtman]]]]\nBeckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more [[Minimalism|minimalist]].\n\n===Early works===\nBeckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection ''[[More Pricks than Kicks]]'' (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:\n\n<blockquote>It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.<ref>''More Pricks than Kicks'', 9</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe passage makes reference to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'', which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.\n\nSimilar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, ''Murphy'' (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and [[Black comedy|black]] [[Gallows humor|humour]] that animate many of Beckett's works: \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\".<ref>''Murphy'', 1</ref> ''Watt'', written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a [[permutation|mathematical permutation]], presaging Beckett's later preoccupation\u2014in both his novels and dramatic works\u2014with precise movement.\n\nBeckett's 1930 essay ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'' was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness\u2014in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates'' (1935)\u2014seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in ''Watt''.\n\n===Middle period===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote  =<poem>\nwho may tell the tale\nof the old man?\nweigh absence in a scale?\nmete want with a span?\nthe sum assess\nof the world's woes?\nnothingness\nin words enclose?\n</poem> |source =From ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' (1953)<ref>''Watt'' by Beckett quoted in: Booth, Wayne C. (1975)  A rhetoric of irony By Wayne C. Booth Chicago University Press p258 {{ISBN|0-226-06553-7}}</ref>}}\nAfter World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the \"revelation\" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin\u2014in which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world\u2014that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.\n\nDuring the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: ''En attendant Godot'' (written 1948\u20131949; ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), ''Fin de partie'' (1955\u20131957; ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''), ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958), and ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961). These plays\u2014which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\"\u2014deal in a [[black comedy|darkly humorous]] way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary [[existentialism|existentialist thinkers]]. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and ''Godot'' were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of [[Albert Camus]]'s concept of \"the absurd\";<ref>Esslin (1969).</ref> this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded [[absurdism|his own philosophy]]). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell\u2014one of the two characters in ''Endgame'' who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak\u2014can best summarise the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.\"<ref>''Endgame'', 18\u201319</ref>\n\nBeckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). In these novels\u2014sometimes referred to as a \"trilogy\", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes\u2014the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004) p586</ref> ''Molloy'', for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a [[detective novel]]. In ''Malone Dies'', movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the \"action\" of the book takes the form of an [[Inner monologue|interior monologue]]. Finally, in ''The Unnamable'', almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of ''The Unnamable'': 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.<ref>''Three Novels'', 414</ref>\n\nAfter these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief \"stories\" later collected as ''Texts for Nothing''. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, ''Comment c'est'' (1961; ''How It Is''). An early variant version of ''Comment c'est'', ''L'Image'', was published in the British arts review, [[X (magazine)|''X: A Quarterly Review'']] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.<ref>\"L\u2019Image\", X: A Quarterly Review, ed. [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] & [[Patrick Swift]], Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959 [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/beckett/career/howitis/publications.html Beckett Exhibition Harry Ransom Centre University of Texas at Austin]</ref>). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching [[telegraphese]]: \"You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark\"<ref>''How It Is'', 22</ref> Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. ''How It Is'' is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.\n\n===Late works===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |lleft|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote  =<poem>\ntime she stopped\nsitting at her window\nquiet at her window\nonly window\nfacing other windows\nother only windows\nall eyes\nall sides\nhigh and low\ntime she stopped\n</poem> |source =From ''Rockaby'' (1980) }}\nThroughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency\u2014already evident in much of his work of the 1950s\u2014towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as [[minimalism|minimalist]]. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', the theatrical [[revue]] for which it served as an introductory piece).<ref>Knowlson (1997) p501</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Beckett DCP 1341.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]]]\nIn his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters\u2014already few in number in the earlier plays\u2014are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama ''[[Eh Joe]]'' (1963), which was written for the actor [[Jack MacGowran]], is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play ''[[Not I]]'' (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, \"a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness\".<ref>Quoted in Knowlson (1997) p522</ref> Following from ''Krapp's Last Tape'', many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in ''Eh Joe'') or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in ''Not I''). Beckett's most politically charged play, ''[[Catastrophe (play)|Catastrophe]]'' (1982), which was dedicated to [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of ''mirlitonnades'', with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including [[Derek Mahon]], have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.\n\nBeckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts ''Fizzles'' (which the American artist [[Jasper Johns]] illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' (1980), which continued with ''[[Ill Seen Ill Said]]'' (1982) and ''[[Worstward Ho]]'' (1984), later collected in ''[[Nohow On]]''. In these three \"'closed space' stories,\"<ref>''Nohow On'', vii</ref> Beckett continued his pre-occupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of ''Company'' make clear: \"A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.\" \"To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said.\"<ref>''Nohow On'', 3</ref> Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''.\n\nIn the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem \"What is the Word\" (\"Comment dire\"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.\n\n==Collaborators==\n\n===Jack MacGowran===\n[[Jack MacGowran]] was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted ''End of Day'' in Dublin in 1962, revising it as ''Beginning To End'' (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970\u20131971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as ''Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.'' Beckett wrote the radio play ''[[Embers]]'' and the teleplay ''[[Eh Joe]]'' specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]],'' and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, ''MacGowran Speaking Beckett'' for [[Claddagh Records]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claddaghrecords.com/index.php/jack-macgowran-macgowran-speaking-beckett.html|title=Jack MacGowran \u2013 MacGowran Speaking Beckett}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|title=Big City Books \u2013 First Editions, Rare, Fanzines, Music Memorabilia \u2013 contact|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010607/http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|archivedate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Billie Whitelaw===\n[[Billie Whitelaw]] worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as ''[[Not I]]'', ''[[Eh Joe]]'', ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]].'' She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography ''Billie Whitelaw...: Who He?,'' she describes their first meeting in 1963 as \"trust at first sight\". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the \"supreme interpreter of his work\", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in ''[[Not I]]''. She said of the play ''Rockaby'': \"I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing ''Happy Days'' and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' \".<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5423443.ece ''The Times Literary Supplement'' 31 December 2008  ''Princes and players''.].

Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: \"She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the nail on the head.

He has divided critical opinion.

She was of British, American and Hawaiian descent.\n\n==Life== \nShe was born on February 1, 1840, in Honolulu, Hawaii, the first-born child and daughter of Abram Henry Fayerweather (1812\u20131850) and Mary Kekahimoku Kolimoalani Beckley (1820\u20131850).{{sfn|New England Historic Genealogical Society|1992|pages=75\u201376}} Her family was considered to be of the [[ali\u02bbi]] (noble) class. She was the maternal granddaughter of British Captain [[George Charles Beckley]] and Ahia, a distant relation of the reigning [[House of Kamehameha]] and descendant of the 15th-century King [[L\u012bloa]].{{sfn|Lam|1932|pages=1\u20137}}{{sfn|Peterson|1984|page=270}} Her two sisters were [[Mary Jane Fayerweather Montano|Mary Jane Fayerweather Davison Montano]] (1840\u20131918), who married American pharmacist Benoni Richmond Davison and Columbian photographer Andreas Avelino Montano, and Hannah Fayerweather Bell (1843\u20131870), who married Thomas Kamukamu Bell.{{sfn|Dye|1997|pages=63\u201375}} A brother named William Malulani Fayerweather (1841\u20131843) died young.{{sfn|New England Historic Genealogical Society|1992|pages=75\u201376}}\n\nOn May 28, 1857, she married Chinese millionaire merchant [[Chun Afong]]. The wedding ceremony was officiated by American Protestant missionary Reverend Lowell Smith.{{sfn|New England Historic Genealogical Society|1992|pages=75\u201376}} This marriage connected Afong to the reigning Kamehameha family and the ruling Hawaiian elite class. In 1874, her husband supported the political aspirations of [[Kal\u0101kaua]] (who shared a wet nurse with Julia and was considered a foster brother). Afong quietly gave financial support to Kal\u0101kaua in the election of 1874 against [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]] (the widow of [[Kamehameha IV]]). After the king's election, he appointed Afong to his [[Privy Council of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Privy Council of State]]. The family business in Hawaii steadily grew with investments in retail, shipping, opium sales, and sugar and coffee plantations.{{sfn|Dye|2010|pages=25\u201328}}{{sfn|Ng|1999|pages=6\u20138}}\n\nAfter the death of Afong's eldest son Chun Alung in 1889, he sold or reorganized most of his business holdings in Hawaii and invested in the Douglas Steamship Company in Hong Kong. He named [[Samuel Mills Damon]] as administrator of an estate left in Hawaii to support Julia and their many children.{{sfn|Day|1984|page=1}} Afong never returned to Hawaii and died in Hong Kong in 1906.{{sfn|Dye|2010|pages=31\u201332}}\n\nJulia Afong died in Honolulu, at the age of 79, on February 14, 1919.

It was later published his 1912 book ''The House of Pride: And Other Tales of Hawaii''. London's highly embellished story of Afong depicts him as a \"crafty coolie\" who spites the white capitalist establishment through his own business success.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas''). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beogradski odonimi.|last=Radovi\u0107|first=Sr\u0111an|year=2014|location=Belgrade|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from [[Kalemegdan]]. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's ''de facto'' independence dates from this event.<ref>Stanford J.

Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions.

The historical core of Belgrade, [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan]], lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, [[New Belgrade]] was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with [[Zemun]]. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like [[Krnja\u010da]], [[Kote\u017e]] and [[Bor\u010da]], also merged with the city, while [[Pan\u010devo]], a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}}, while together with its metropolitan area it covers {{convert|3223|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is [[Torlak (Belgrade)|Torlak hill]] at {{convert|303|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[loam|loessial]] [[plateau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |publisher=City of Belgrade (official website) |title=Natural Features |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><!--{{cite conference |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~icuc5/text/P_1_10.pdf |title=Topoclimate and air pollution effects on respiratory diseases occurrences in Belgrade |first=Verica |last=Gbur\u010dik |author2=Valentina Gbur\u010dik|author3=Ljubinka Mar\u010deti\u0107|author4=Slobodan To\u0161ovi\u0107 |publisher=Institute of Public Health of Belgrade |format=PDF}}-->\n\nOne of the characteristics of the city terrain is [[mass wasting]]. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

It was opened in 1816 and closed in 1890.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Millbank Prison Plan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Plan of Millbank Prison]]\nThe site at Millbank was originally purchased in 1799 from the [[James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] for \u00a312,000 by the philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], acting on behalf of [[the Crown]], for the erection of his proposed [[Panopticon]] prison as Britain's new National Penitentiary.<ref name=Timbs>{{cite book|first=John|last=Timbs |author-link=John Timbs|title=Curiosities of London: Exhibiting the Most Rare and Remarkable Objects of Interest in the Metropolis|url=https://archive.org/stream/curiositiesoflon00timbrich#page/697/mode/1up|year=1855|publisher=D.

Proposals for the National Penitentiary continued, however, and were given a legislative basis in the [[Penitentiary House, etc. Act 1812|Penitentiary House, etc. Act]] of 1812 (52 Geo. 3 c. 44). An architectural competition for a new prison building on the Millbank site attracted 43 entrants: the winning design was that of William Williams, drawing master at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. Williams' basic plan was adapted by a practising architect, [[Thomas Hardwick]], who began construction in the same year. Hardwick resigned in 1813, and John Harvey took over the role. Harvey was dismissed in turn in 1815, and replaced by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], who brought the project to completion in 1821.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Cunningham (British writer) |chapter=Millbank Prison |title=Hand-book of London: past and present |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=1850 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookoflondon00cunn/page/337 337]\u201338 |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookoflondon00cunn }}</ref> Further legislation was passed in the form of the [[Millbank Penitentiary Act 1816|Millbank Penitentiary Act]] of 1816 (56 Geo. 3 c. 63).\n\nThe marshy site on which the prison stood meant that the builders experienced problems of [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]] from the outset, and explains the succession of architects. Smirke finally resolved the difficulty by introducing a highly innovative [[concrete]] [[Floating raft system|raft]] to provide a secure foundation. However, this added considerably to the construction costs, which eventually totalled \u00a3500,000, more than twice the original estimate and equivalent to \u00a3500 per cell.<ref name=Timbs />\n\n==History==\nThe first prisoners, all women, were admitted on 26 June 1816. The first men arrived in January 1817. The prison held 103 men and 109 women by the end of 1817, and 452 men and 326 women by late 1822. Sentences of five to ten years in the National Penitentiary were offered as an alternative to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] to those thought most likely to reform. \n\nIn addition to the problems of construction, the marshy site fostered disease, to which the prisoners had little immunity owing to their extremely poor diet. In 1818 the authorities engaged Dr [[Alexander Copland Hutchison]] of Westminster Dispensary as Medical Supervisor, to oversee the health of the inmates.<ref>''Parliamentary Papers 1780\u20131849'', vol. 5, 1825: \"The General Penitentiary at Millbank\".</ref> In 1822&ndash;23 an epidemic swept through the prison, which seems to have comprised a mixture of [[dysentery]], [[scurvy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other disorders.<ref>Evans 1982, p. 249.</ref> The decision was eventually taken to evacuate the buildings for several months: the female prisoners were released, and the male prisoners temporarily transferred to the [[List of British prison hulks|prison hulks]] at [[Woolwich]], where their health improved.\n\nThe design of Millbank also turned out to be unsatisfactory. The network of corridors was so labyrinthine that even the warders got lost;<ref>Griffiths 1884, p. 27.</ref> and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs turned out to be an unsupportable \u00a316,000.\n\nIn view of these problems, the decision was eventually taken to build a new \"model prison\" at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]], which opened in 1842 and took over Millbank's role as the National Penitentiary. By an Act of Parliament of 1843, Millbank's status was downgraded, and it became a holding depot for convicts prior to [[Penal transportation|transportation]]. Every person sentenced to transportation was sent to Millbank first, where they were held for three months before their final destination was decided. By 1850, around 4,000 people were condemned annually to transportation from the UK.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> Prisoners awaiting transportation were kept in solitary confinement and restricted to silence for the first half of their sentence.\n\nLarge-scale transportation ended in 1853 (although the practice continued on a reduced scale until 1867); and Millbank then became an ordinary local prison, and from 1870 a military prison. By 1886 it had ceased to hold inmates, and it closed in 1890.<ref>Brodie ''et al.'' 2002, p. 60.</ref> Demolition began in 1892, and continued sporadically until 1903.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Burial ground at Millbank Prison.JPG|thumb|The prison's burial ground, with the [[Houses of Parliament]] in the background. The image was published in 1862.]]\n[[File:Millbank Cassell's large-scale map of London c 1867.jpg|thumb|Map of 1867, showing the prison and its surroundings]]\nThe plan of the prison comprised a circular chapel at the centre of the site, surrounded by a three-storey hexagon made up of the governor's quarters, administrative offices and laundries, surrounded in turn by six pentagons of cell blocks. The buildings of each pentagon were set around a cluster of five small courtyards (with a [[watchtower]] at the centre) used as airing-yards, and in which prisoners undertook labour.<ref>Griffiths 1884, p. 26.</ref> The three outer angles of each pentagon were distinguished by tall circular towers, described in 1862 as \"[[Martello tower|Martello]]-like\": these served in part as watchtowers, but their primary purpose was to contain staircases and [[Flush toilet|water-closets]].<ref name=MayhewBinny>Mayhew and Binny 1862.</ref><ref>Holford 1828, plan of prison.</ref> The third and fourth pentagons (those to the north-west, furthest from the entrance) were used to house female prisoners, and the remaining four for male prisoners.\n\nIn the ''Handbook of London'' in 1850 the prison was described as follows:<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n{{quote|A mass of brickwork equal to a fortress, on the left bank of the [[Thames]], close to [[Vauxhall Bridge]]; erected on ground bought in 1799 of the Marquis of Salisbury, and established pursuant to [[Penitentiary House, etc. Act 1812|52 Geo. III., c. 44]], passed Aug 20th, 1812. It was designed by Jeremy Bentham [factually incorrect], to whom the fee-simple of the ground was conveyed, and is said to have cost the enormous sum of half a million sterling. The external walls form an irregular octagon, and enclose upwards of sixteen acres of land. Its ground-plan resembles a wheel, the governor's house occupying a circle in the centre, from which radiate six piles of building, terminating externally in towers. The ground on which it stands is raised but little above the river, and was at one time considered unhealthy.

Proposals for the National Penitentiary continued, however, and were given a legislative basis in the [[Penitentiary House, etc. Act 1812|Penitentiary House, etc. Act]] of 1812 (52 Geo. 3 c. 44). An architectural competition for a new prison building on the Millbank site attracted 43 entrants: the winning design was that of William Williams, drawing master at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. Williams' basic plan was adapted by a practising architect, [[Thomas Hardwick]], who began construction in the same year. Hardwick resigned in 1813, and John Harvey took over the role. Harvey was dismissed in turn in 1815, and replaced by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], who brought the project to completion in 1821.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Cunningham (British writer) |chapter=Millbank Prison |title=Hand-book of London: past and present |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=1850 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookoflondon00cunn/page/337 337]\u201338 |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookoflondon00cunn }}</ref> Further legislation was passed in the form of the [[Millbank Penitentiary Act 1816|Millbank Penitentiary Act]] of 1816 (56 Geo. 3 c. 63).\n\nThe marshy site on which the prison stood meant that the builders experienced problems of [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]] from the outset, and explains the succession of architects. Smirke finally resolved the difficulty by introducing a highly innovative [[concrete]] [[Floating raft system|raft]] to provide a secure foundation. However, this added considerably to the construction costs, which eventually totalled \u00a3500,000, more than twice the original estimate and equivalent to \u00a3500 per cell.<ref name=Timbs />\n\n==History==\nThe first prisoners, all women, were admitted on 26 June 1816. The first men arrived in January 1817. The prison held 103 men and 109 women by the end of 1817, and 452 men and 326 women by late 1822. Sentences of five to ten years in the National Penitentiary were offered as an alternative to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] to those thought most likely to reform. \n\nIn addition to the problems of construction, the marshy site fostered disease, to which the prisoners had little immunity owing to their extremely poor diet. In 1818 the authorities engaged Dr [[Alexander Copland Hutchison]] of Westminster Dispensary as Medical Supervisor, to oversee the health of the inmates.<ref>''Parliamentary Papers 1780\u20131849'', vol. 5, 1825: \"The General Penitentiary at Millbank\".</ref> In 1822&ndash;23 an epidemic swept through the prison, which seems to have comprised a mixture of [[dysentery]], [[scurvy]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other disorders.<ref>Evans 1982, p. 249.</ref> The decision was eventually taken to evacuate the buildings for several months: the female prisoners were released, and the male prisoners temporarily transferred to the [[List of British prison hulks|prison hulks]] at [[Woolwich]], where their health improved.\n\nThe design of Millbank also turned out to be unsatisfactory. The network of corridors was so labyrinthine that even the warders got lost;<ref>Griffiths 1884, p. 27.</ref> and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs turned out to be an unsupportable \u00a316,000.\n\nIn view of these problems, the decision was eventually taken to build a new \"model prison\" at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]], which opened in 1842 and took over Millbank's role as the National Penitentiary. By an Act of Parliament of 1843, Millbank's status was downgraded, and it became a holding depot for convicts prior to [[Penal transportation|transportation]]. Every person sentenced to transportation was sent to Millbank first, where they were held for three months before their final destination was decided. By 1850, around 4,000 people were condemned annually to transportation from the UK.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> Prisoners awaiting transportation were kept in solitary confinement and restricted to silence for the first half of their sentence.\n\nLarge-scale transportation ended in 1853 (although the practice continued on a reduced scale until 1867); and Millbank then became an ordinary local prison, and from 1870 a military prison. By 1886 it had ceased to hold inmates, and it closed in 1890.<ref>Brodie ''et al.'' 2002, p. 60.</ref> Demolition began in 1892, and continued sporadically until 1903.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Burial ground at Millbank Prison.JPG|thumb|The prison's burial ground, with the [[Houses of Parliament]] in the background.

After dispatching the Canadiens, the Blueshirts faced off against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) in a best-of-five series, with all games played at the [[Arena Gardens]]. As one of the duties of the hockey commission for the NHA, PCHA and Maritime leagues, the playoff with the PCHA had been arranged prior to the season, but it had not been cleared with the Stanley Cup trustees.  A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After All is Said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}</ref> The trustees later sent a letter to league executives that Stanley Cup playoff arrangements would be handled by the leagues themselves henceforth.\n\nTotal attendance for the series was 14,260, out of a possible 22,500 (including standing room) capacity at the Arena. At the time, professional hockey was less of a draw than [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) senior hockey. Two games between local OHA senior teams had drawn over 14,000.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Puckerings |page=22}}</ref> The Torontos players and staff received $297 each as their share of the gate receipts.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Toronto Players Receive $297 Each |page=22}}</ref>\n\n;Toronto 3, Victoria 0\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n| '''#''' || '''Date''' || '''Visitor''' || '''Score''' || '''Home''' || '''Record'''\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 1 || March 14 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 2\u20135 || Toronto || 1\u20130\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 2 || March 17 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 5\u20136 || Toronto || 2\u20130\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 3 || March 19 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 1\u20132 || Toronto || 3\u20130\n|}\n<ref name=\"coleman\" />\n\n==Toronto Hockey Club 1914 Stanley Cup Champions==\n[[File:1914_Toronto_Hockey_Club_Worlds_Champions_Medal.jpg|thumb|right|<center> 1914 Worlds Champions Medal <br> Issued to Claude Wilson</center>]]\nWhen the Stanley Cup arrived in Toronto, it was put on public display in the window of the Eaton's department store.{{sfn|Zweig|2012|p=280}}\n{{Stanley Cup champion\n|defence=*[[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]] (Point-Playing-Manager) \n*Connie [[Con Corbeau]] (Point)\n*[[Harry Cameron]] (Cover point)\n*[[George McNamara]](Cover point)\n* [[Eddie Carpenter]] (substitute)\u2020\n|goaltenders=* Harry [[Hap Holmes]]\n*[[Claude Wilson (ice hockey)|Claude Wilson]](sub)\n|wingers=*Allan [[Scotty Davidson]] (Captain)\n*[[James Harriston]]\u2020\n*[[Roy McGiffin]]\u2021 \n*[[Jack Walker (ice hockey)|Jack Walker]]\n*Carol [[Cully Wilson]]\n|centers=*[[Frank Foyston]]\n|player-notes=\u2020 missing from team picture<br>\u2021 also played rover in the Stanley Cup Final\n|non-players=\n*[[Percy Quinn]] (President)\u2020\n*[[Dick Carroll]] (Trainer)\n*[[Frank Carroll (ice hockey)|Frank Carroll]] (Ass't Trainer)\n|engraving-notes=\"1914 Toronto H.C.\" is engraved on the 1947 ring connecting the upper trophy to the barrel\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[1913\u201314 NHA season]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey |last=Harper |first=Stephen J. |year=2013 |publisher=Simon & Schuster Canada |isbn=978-1-4767-1653-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Zweig |first1=Eric |year=2012 |title=Stanley Cup: 120 years of hockey supremacy |publisher=Firefly Books |isbn=978-1-77085-104-7 |ref=harv}}\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Toronto Blueshirts}}\n{{Toronto Blueshirts seasons}}\n{{1913\u201314 NHA season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1913-14 Toronto Hockey Club season}}\n[[Category:Toronto Blueshirts seasons]]\n[[Category:1913\u201314 in Canadian ice hockey by team|Toronto Hockey Club season, 1913-14]]\n[[Category:Stanley Cup championship seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox IcehockeyTeamSeason\n  |Season=1913\u201314\n  |year=1913\n  |Team=Toronto Hockey Club\n  |League=NHA\n  |Conference=\n  |ConferenceRank=\n  |Division=\n  |DivisionRank=\n  |Record=13\u20137\u20130\n  |HomeRecord=8\u20132\u20130\n  |RoadRecord=5\u20135\u20130\n  |GoalsFor=93\n  |GoalsAgainst=65\n  |GeneralManager=[[Percy Quinn]]\n  |Coach=[[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]]\n  |Captain=[[Scotty Davidson]]\n  |AltCaptain=\n  |Arena=[[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]]\n  |Attendance=\n  |GoalsLeader=\n  |AssistsLeader=\n  |PointsLeader=\n  |PlusMinusLeader=\n  |PIMLeader=\n  |WinsLeader=\n  |GAALeader=\n  |StanleyCup=Yes\n}}\n\nThe '''[[1913\u201314 NHA season|1913\u201314]] [[Toronto Blueshirts|Toronto Hockey Club]] season''' was the second season of the Toronto franchise in the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA).

It was rumoured that the Torontos had thrown the last two games to get an extra home game from a final with Montreal.{{sfn|Harper|2013|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\n===Final standings===\n{{1913\u201314 NHA standings |team=BLU}}\n\n===Schedule and results===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n| '''#''' || '''Date''' || '''Visitor''' || '''Score''' || '''Home''' || '''Record''' || '''Pts'''\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 1 || December 27 || [[Montreal Canadiens]] || 0\u20133 || Toronto || 1\u20130\u20130 || 2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 2 || December 30 || Toronto || 3\u20137 || [[Montreal Wanderers]] || 1\u20131\u20130 || 2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 3 || January 3 || [[Quebec Bulldogs]] || 3\u20136 || Toronto || 2\u20131\u20130 || 4\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 4 || January 7 || Toronto || 9\u20133 || [[Toronto Ontarios]] || 3\u20131\u20130 || 6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 5 || January 10 || [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] || 3\u20132 || Toronto || 3\u20132\u20130 || 6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 6 || January 14 || [[Montreal Wanderers]] || 2\u201310 || Toronto || 4\u20132\u20130 || 8\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 7 || January 17 || Toronto || 9\u20134 || [[Quebec Bulldogs]] || 5\u20132\u20130 || 10\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 8 || January 21 || [[Toronto Ontarios]] || 2\u20139 || Toronto || 6\u20132\u20130 || 12\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 9 || January 24 || Toronto || 1\u20134 || [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]]|| 6\u20133\u20130 || 12\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 10 || January 28 || Toronto || 3\u20134 || [[Montreal Canadiens]] || 6\u20134\u20130 || 12\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 11 || January 31 || Toronto || 5\u20133 || [[Montreal Wanderers]] || 7\u20134\u20130 || 14\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 12 || February 4 || [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] || 1\u20132 || Toronto || 8\u20134\u20130 || 16\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 13 || February 7 || Toronto || 3\u20139 || [[Montreal Canadiens]] || 8\u20135\u20130 || 16\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 14 || February 11 || [[Quebec Bulldogs]] || 3\u20134 || Toronto || 9\u20135\u20130 || 18\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 15 || February 14 || [[Toronto Ontarios]] || 1\u20133 || Toronto || 10\u20135\u20130 || 20\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 16 || February 18 || Toronto || 4\u20131 || [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]]|| 11\u20135\u20130 || 22\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 17 || February 21 || [[Montreal Canadiens]] || 2\u20133 || Toronto || 12\u20135\u20130 || 24\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 18 || February 25 || Toronto || 6\u20131 || [[Toronto Ontarios]] || 13\u20135\u20130 || 26\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 19 || February 28 || Toronto || 3\u20135 || [[Quebec Bulldogs]] || 13\u20136\u20130 || 26\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"\n| 20 || March 4 || [[Montreal Wanderers]] || 7\u20135 || Toronto || 13\u20137\u20130 || 26\n|}\n<ref name=\"coleman\">{{cite book |last=Coleman|first=Charles|title=The Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol. 1, 1893\u20131926 inc.|year=1966|publisher=NHL}}</ref>\n\n==NHA playoffs==\nTied at the top of the standings, the Blueshirts and Canadiens faced off in a two-game, total goals series for the league championship and [[Stanley Cup]].

After dispatching the Canadiens, the Blueshirts faced off against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) in a best-of-five series, with all games played at the [[Arena Gardens]]. As one of the duties of the hockey commission for the NHA, PCHA and Maritime leagues, the playoff with the PCHA had been arranged prior to the season, but it had not been cleared with the Stanley Cup trustees.  A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After All is Said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}</ref> The trustees later sent a letter to league executives that Stanley Cup playoff arrangements would be handled by the leagues themselves henceforth.\n\nTotal attendance for the series was 14,260, out of a possible 22,500 (including standing room) capacity at the Arena. At the time, professional hockey was less of a draw than [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) senior hockey. Two games between local OHA senior teams had drawn over 14,000.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Puckerings |page=22}}</ref> The Torontos players and staff received $297 each as their share of the gate receipts.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=March 21, 1914 |title=Toronto Players Receive $297 Each |page=22}}</ref>\n\n;Toronto 3, Victoria 0\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n| '''#''' || '''Date''' || '''Visitor''' || '''Score''' || '''Home''' || '''Record'''\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 1 || March 14 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 2\u20135 || Toronto || 1\u20130\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 2 || March 17 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 5\u20136 || Toronto || 2\u20130\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n| 3 || March 19 || [[Victoria Aristocrats]] || 1\u20132 || Toronto || 3\u20130\n|}\n<ref name=\"coleman\" />\n\n==Toronto Hockey Club 1914 Stanley Cup Champions==\n[[File:1914_Toronto_Hockey_Club_Worlds_Champions_Medal.jpg|thumb|right|<center> 1914 Worlds Champions Medal <br> Issued to Claude Wilson</center>]]\nWhen the Stanley Cup arrived in Toronto, it was put on public display in the window of the Eaton's department store.{{sfn|Zweig|2012|p=280}}\n{{Stanley Cup champion\n|defence=*[[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]] (Point-Playing-Manager) \n*Connie [[Con Corbeau]] (Point)\n*[[Harry Cameron]] (Coverpoint)\n*[[George McNamara]](Coverpoint)\n* [[Eddie Carpenter]] (substitute)\u2020\n|goaltenders=* Harry [[Hap Holmes]]\n*[[Claude Wilson (ice hockey)|Claude Wilson]](sub)\n|wingers=*Allan [[Scotty Davidson]] (Captain)\n*[[James Harriston]]\u2020\n*[[Roy McGiffin]]\u2021 \n*[[Jack Walker (ice hockey)|Jack Walker]]\n*Carol [[Cully Wilson]]\n|centers=*[[Frank Foyston]]\n|player-notes=\u2020 missing from team picture<br>\u2021 also played rover in the Stanley Cup Final\n|non-players=\n*[[Percy Quinn]] (President)\u2020\n*[[Dick Carroll]] (Trainer)\n*[[Frank Carroll (ice hockey)|Frank Carroll]] (Ass't Trainer)\n|engraving-notes=\"1914 Toronto H.C.\" is engraved on the 1947 ring connecting the upper trophy to the barrel\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[1913\u201314 NHA season]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey |last=Harper |first=Stephen J. |year=2013 |publisher=Simon & Schuster Canada |isbn=978-1-4767-1653-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Zweig |first1=Eric |year=2012 |title=Stanley Cup: 120 years of hockey supremacy |publisher=Firefly Books |isbn=978-1-77085-104-7 |ref=harv}}\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Toronto Blueshirts}}\n{{Toronto Blueshirts seasons}}\n{{1913\u201314 NHA season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1913-14 Toronto Hockey Club season}}\n[[Category:Toronto Blueshirts seasons]]\n[[Category:1913\u201314 in Canadian ice hockey by team|Toronto Hockey Club season, 1913-14]]\n[[Category:Stanley Cup championship seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Eschoryii", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eToronto Hockey Club 1914 Stanley Cup Champions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913%E2%80%9314_Toronto_Hockey_Club_season"}
