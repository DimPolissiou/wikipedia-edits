In 1930 Skalkottas devoted considerable effort to having some of his works performed in Athens, but they were met with incomprehension, and even in Berlin his few performances did not make much better headway.

In Athens Skalkottas sought other means of funding through scholarships or paid work as an orchestral player, but he was quickly disillusioned with the state of musical affairs in Athens at the time. Until his death he earned a living as a back-desk violinist in the Athens Conservatory, Radio and Opera orchestras. In the mid-1930s he worked at the Folk Music Archive in Athens, and did transcriptions of Greek folk songs into Western-music scores for the musicologist [[Melpo Merlier]].\n\nAs a composer he worked alone, but wrote prolifically, mainly in his very personal post-Schoenbergian idiom that had little chance of being comprehended by the Greek musical establishment. He did secure some performances, especially of some of the ''Greek Dances'' and a few of his more tonal works, but the vast bulk of his music went unheard. During the German occupation of Greece he was placed in an internment camp for some months. In 1946 he married the pianist [[Maria Pangali]]; they had two sons. In 1949, at the age of 45 and shortly before the birth of his second son, he died of what appears to have been the rupture of a neglected common [[hernia]], leaving some symphonic works with incomplete orchestration, and many completed works that were given posthumous premieres.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Nikos Skalkottas}}\nSkalkottas's early works, most of which he wrote in Berlin, are lost, as are some of those written in Athens. The earliest of his works available to us today date from 1922\u201324; these are piano compositions as well as the orchestration of ''Cretan Feast'' by [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]]. Among the works written in Berlin are the sonata for solo violin, several works for piano, chamber music and some symphonic works. Although during the period 1931\u201334 Skalkottas did not compose anything, he resumed composing in Athens and continued until his death. His output comprised symphonic works (''36 Greek Dances'', the symphonic [[overture]] ''The Return of Ulysses'', the fairy drama ''Mayday Spell'', the Second Symphonic Suite, the ballet ''The Maiden and Death'', works for wind orchestra and several concertos), chamber, vocal and instrumental works including the huge cycle of ''32 Piano Pieces''.\n\nBesides his musical work, Skalkottas compiled an important theoretical work, consisting of several \"musical articles\", a ''Treatise on Orchestration'', musical analyses, etc. Skalkottas soon shaped his personal features of musical writing so that any influence of his teachers was soon assimilated creatively in a manner of composition that is absolutely personal and recognizable.\n\nThroughout his career Skalkottas remained faithful to the neo-classical ideals of [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] and '[[absolute music]]' proclaimed in Europe in the 1925. Already in Berlin he was taking an interest in [[jazz]] and at the same time developing a very personal form of the twelve-note method, making use of not one but several tone-rows in a work and organizing these rows to define different thematic and harmonic areas. (For example, the ''Largo Sinfonico'' employs no fewer than 16 twelve-tone rows.) Like Schoenberg, he persistently cultivated classical forms (such as [[sonata]], [[variation (music)|variations]], [[suite (music)|suite]]), but his worklist is divided between [[atonal]], [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] and [[tonality|tonal]] works, all three categories spanning his entire composing career. Such apparent heterogeneity could have been intensified by a love of [[Greek folk music]]. The most striking example of his commitment to Greek folk music is the series of ''36 Greek Dances'' composed for orchestra between 1931 and 1936, arranged for various different ensembles in the ensuing years and in part radically re-orchestrated in 1948\u201349. About two-thirds of these dances are based on genuine Greek folk themes from different parts of the Greek mainland and islands, but the other third use material of Skalkottas's own composition in folk style.\n\nNevertheless, he remained sceptical of the attempts of his Greek contemporaries to integrate folk music into the modern symphonic style, and only juxtaposed and mixed folk, atonal and 12-note styles in a few works such as the incidental music to [[Christos Evelpides]]'s 1943 fairy-tale drama ''Mayday Spell''. Skalkottas was evidently reluctant to deploy the kind of structural and stylistic tensions that would have betrayed the integrationist ideals of his Schoenbergian inheritance. This could be seen (in terms of a comprehensive connecting impulse) as a link between the [[Second Viennese School|Second Viennese]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3kian]] schools. Around 1945 he seems to have reappraised his aesthetic direction to some extent and written several works in a more conventionally tonal idiom - many of these have [[key signature]]s, for instance, yet the general level of dissonance is not significantly lessened.\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nIt was only after his death that Skalkottas' music began to be played, published or critically estimated to a great extent, partly due to the efforts of friends and disciples such as [[John G. Papaioannou]] and George Hadjinikos.\n\nIn 1988 a short documentary (60 mins) about his life and work was filmed with funding from the local authorities of Skalkottas' birthplace (the isle of Euboea) as well as the Greek Ministry of Culture.\n\nBetween the years 1998 and 2008, the Swedish record label [[BIS records]] released recordings of his works.\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Thornley|2001}}|reference=Thornley, John. 2001. \"Skalkottas, Nikos [Nikolaos]\".

Payne Field was a major [[Air Transport Command (the United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] air cargo and passenger hub, connecting westwards through [[Benina International Airport|Benghazi Airport]] (during the war known as ''Soluch Airfield'') to [[Houari Boumediene Airport|Algiers airport]] on the North African route to [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport|Dakar Airport]], in [[French West Africa]].\n\nOther locations which transport routes were flown were [[RAF Habbaniya]], [[Iraq]] on the Cairo \u2013 [[Karachi]], [[India]] route; [[Lydda Airport]], [[Mandatory Palestine|BritishPalestine]]; [[Jeddah]], [[Arabia]], on the Central African route to [[Roberts International Airport|Roberts Field]], [[Liberia]] (1941\u20131943), and later after the war ended, [[Ellinikon International Airport|Athens]], [[Greece]] and on to destinations in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atcroutes-1sep1945.jpg |title=Map of worldwide routes of Air Transport Command, September 1945 |work=Wikimedia Commons |year=1945 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209172722/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atcroutes-1sep1945.jpg |archive-date=9 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhen American forces left the base at the end of the war, the Civil Aviation Authority took over the facility and began using it for international civil aviation. In 1963, Cairo International Airport replaced the old Heliopolis Airport, which had been located at the Hike-Step area in the east of Cairo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history.asp |title=Airport History |work=Cairo International Airport |year=2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013060524/http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history.asp |archive-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe airport is administered by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, which controls the Cairo Airport Company, the Egyptian Airports Company, National Air Navigation Services and Aviation Information Technology, and the Cairo Airport Authority. In 2004, [[Fraport AG]] won the management contract to run the airport for eight years, with options to extend the contract twice in one-year increments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fraport.com/cms/press_center/dok/31/31283.fraport_ag_wins_management_contract_for.htm |title=Fraport AG Wins Management Contract for Cairo Airport in Egypt |work=Fraport AG |date=20 December 2004 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123065022/http://www.fraport.com/cms/press_center/dok/31/31283.fraport_ag_wins_management_contract_for.htm |archivedate=23 January 2009  }}</ref>\n\n==Terminals==\nThe terminal facilities include Departure Hall 1, International Hall 3, and Hall 4 for private and non-commercial aircraft services. As part of the recent upgrading and facility improvement scheme, the CAA demolished the old Hall 3, previously used for domestic arrivals and departures, to reconstruct a new hall to be used for international arrivals. Terminal 1 is locally known as the \"Old Airport,\" although its facilities were recently given a complete overhaul and are newer than those of Terminal 2, which is still known as the \"New Airport.\"\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 was originally used by EgyptAir and several Middle Eastern airlines. However, an increasing number of other foreign carriers, such as [[Air France]] and [[KLM]] transferred operations from Terminal 2 in 2006. In May 2009 [[EgyptAir]] moved all its operations to the new Terminal 3 (along with all [[Star Alliance]] airlines serving the airport). In March 2010, with the closure of Terminal 2 for major renovation works, all non-Star Alliance airlines serving the airport shifted operations to the terminal.\n\nDepartures and arrivals are with all airlines departing from Terminal 1 Hall 1, with the exception [[Saudia]] which is the sole tenant of Terminal 1 Hall 2 due to the size of their operations (SV accounted for 65% of Terminal 2's traffic in 2009). Most international airlines arrive in Hall 3. Arrival Hall 2 was recently reopened and serves international and domestic arrivals.\n\nThe CAC has inaugurated the \"Airport City Concept\" to provide an array of services and entertainment facilities to travelers, airport visitors, as well as the general public. The first phase, a new shopping mall called the 'AirMall,' has been built near Terminal 1's International Arrival Hall 3.\n\nAs of 2009 the facade of the terminal was being upgraded. A study on reorganizing the departure and arrival halls is ongoing as well as the feasibility study to include contact stands to improve the service and comfort levels to the passengers. Terminal 1 has 12 gates.\n\n====Hall 4====\nTerminal 1, Hall 4 is dedicated to private and executive jet services. Even though it is referred to as a 'Hall' under Terminal 1 it is operated independently from the commercial passenger terminal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n[[Smart Aviation Company]] has been based at the building since 2007; it moved to a new executive FBO in 2010 adjacent to Hall 4.[[File:CairoAirport-Terminal1.JPG|thumb|Departures area at Terminal 1]]\n\n===Terminal 2===\n\n[[File:CAI T2 20200110.jpg|thumb|Cairo Duty-Free at Cairo Airport Terminal 2]]\n\nTerminal 2 was inaugurated in 1986 with 7 boarding gates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history2.asp |title=Airport History |work=Cairo International Airport |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041113174604/http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history2.asp |archive-date=13 November 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It primarily served European, Gulf and East Asian airlines. The terminal was closed in April 2010 for complete renovations starting in 2012 and lasting 36 months. The architecture of the building limited the opportunities for further expansion which necessitated the entire building to be closed for major structural overhaul at an estimated cost of approximately $400 million.\n\nIn February 2010 the [[World Bank]]'s Board of Executive Directors approved a loan amount of $387 million to support the Cairo Airport Development Project (CADP) to overhaul the terminal with national banks providing the rest. The project aimed at increasing the terminal capacity from 3 million to 7.5 million passengers annually. The upgrade included the complete modernization of the 20-year-old facility to reach the same level of service as the new Terminal 3. In August 2011, Turkey's [[Limak Holding]] won the tender for modernizing the terminal.\n\nAfter several project delays, the renovated terminal had its soft opening on 28 September 2016 with a capacity of 7.5 million passengers bringing the airport's total passenger capacity to 30 million passengers annually. The new terminal has 14 gates and an additional 5 remote stands.[[File:Nile_Air_A320_in_Special_'Egypt_Tourism'_Livery_(2016).jpg|thumb|right|Nile Air [[Airbus A320]] Special ' Egypt Tourism' Livery at Cairo International Airport (June 2016)]][[File:Gate at Terminal 3 Cairo International Airport - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Gate at Terminal 3 Cairo International Airport]]During February 2017, Saudi Arabian Airlines launched its first international \"Al-Fursan lounge\" at Cairo International Airport Terminal 2. The 1,500 square-meter lounge can accommodate 300 people at a time.\n\nThe renovated terminal is operating jointly with Terminal 3 as one integrated terminal via an air bridge, thus, reinforcing the role of Cairo International Airport as a regional hub.\n\n===Terminal 3===\nGiven projected growth, and the limited ability to expand Terminal 2, the [[Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation]] began construction of Terminal 3 in 2004. The terminal was officially inaugurated on 18 December 2008 and opened for commercial operations on 27 April 2009. The facility is twice as large as the current two terminal buildings combined, with the capacity to handle 11 million passengers annually (6 million international and 5 million domestic) once the first phase is completed. It is adjacent to Terminal 2, and the two terminals are initially connected by a bridge.\n\nWith its hub at the airport, EgyptAir's operations were overhauled with the full transfer of its operations (international and domestic) into the new terminal between 27 April and 15 June 2009. To implement the [[Star Alliance]] \"Move Under One Roof\" concept, all Alliance members serving the airport were relocated to the terminal by the first of August 2009.\n\nThe new terminal includes:\n\n* Two piers of extendable capacity and gates facilities serving domestic and international traffic on contact and remote stands. The main building and the piers are connected by concourses. Two of the gates are equipped to handle Airbus A380 aircraft. Provisions for a third pier are in the planning stages.\n* Terminal 3 has 23 gates (2 gates for the A380), 6 check-in islands consisting of 110 check-in counters (plus 10 mobile counters and 10 CUSS kiosks), 76 immigration counters (plus 5 biometric gates), 52 contact and remote aircraft parking stands (5 with multiple uses), 425 FIDS, 15 public information points, 7 baggage carousels, 63 elevators, 50 moving walkways and 51 escalators.\n* Retails space covers more than 5,000m<sup>2</sup> (4.034m<sup>2</sup> occupied by [[EgyptAir]] Tourism & Duty Free Shops).\n*[[File:CairoIntlAirportT3DutyFree.jpg|alt=|thumb|T3 Duty free area]]International food court with Oriental, Asian and Western food (incl. [[Burger King]], Hippopotamus, [[Upper Crust (restaurant chain)|Upper Crust]]).\n*Landside roads including bridges and fly-over serving the traffic to and from the terminal building, surface car park areas (multi-story parking garage capable of holding more than 3,000 cars), a new access road connecting the airport with the Autostrad road (Cairo ring road) and upgrading the access roads.\n\n===Seasonal flight terminal===\nOn 20 September 2011 Prime Minister Sharaf inaugurated the new Seasonal Flights Terminal (ST), located west of Terminal 3. During the start-up phase EgyptAir operates its daily flight to Medina from the new Terminal. All [[Hajj]] traffic of EgyptAir will move to the ST while Saudia's Hajj flights will still operate from Terminal 1. More destinations might be added during winter.\n\nThe terminal has an annual capacity of 3.2 million passengers with 27 check-in counters and 7 gates with a common gate and single security concept, the first in Cairo. It is designed to handle 1,200 passengers per hour. Passengers will be bussed to remote aircraft stands around Terminal 3. Its purpose is to ease operational strains on the existing terminals during pilgrim seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/?=58031 |title= State Information Service |work= sis.gov.eg |access-date= 8 February 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141003014109/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/?=58031 |archive-date= 3 October 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Cairo International Airport.JPG|alt=|thumb|Airport entrance]]\nThe airport has four terminals, the third (and largest) opened on 27 April 2009 and the Seasonal Flights Terminal opened on 20 September 2011.

The new line, Line 3, which is in an advanced stage of execution, will link [[Greater Cairo]] from east to west with the airport at one end, and [[Mohandessin]] district at the other. It is expected to be fully operational by 2019.{{update after|2015|12|31}}\n* Development of real estate and the '' 'Oasis Project' '' which entails a business park with company headquarters and regional offices.\n* Construction of'' 'Aerocity''', a family leisure park to be built within the airport's investment zone. With an area of {{convert|3|km2}}, the enterprise should cost 1 billion Egyptian pounds (US$183 million) and will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will consist of the building of a business center, and the second, of an entertainment park following the guidelines of Disney World, in the United States. There will also be parks, artificial lake, game courts, a water park, 18 cinemas and several restaurants. This will be a new feature of Cairo Airport and forms part of the long-term development and modernization plan.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n<!-- WHEN ADDING A NEW ROUTE, OR ADDING AN END DATE

The airport is located in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]], to the northeast of Cairo around {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the business area of the city and has an area of approximately {{convert|37|km2|sqmi}}. It is the second busiest airport in Africa after [[OR Tambo International Airport]] in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] built '''Payne Airfield''' to serve the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], rather than take over the existing [[Almaza Air Base|Almaza Airport]] located {{convert|5|km|mi}} away. Payne Field was a major [[Air Transport Command (the United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] air cargo and passenger hub, connecting westwards through [[Benina International Airport|Benghazi Airport]] (during the war known as ''Soluch Airfield'') to [[Houari Boumediene Airport|Algiers airport]] on the North African route to [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport|Dakar Airport]], in [[French West Africa]].\n\nOther locations which transport routes were flown were [[RAF Habbaniya]], [[Iraq]] on the Cairo \u2013 [[Karachi]], [[India]] route; [[Lydda Airport]], [[Mandatory Palestine|BritishPalestine]]; [[Jeddah]], [[Arabia]], on the Central African route to [[Roberts International Airport|Roberts Field]], [[Liberia]] (1941\u20131943), and later after the war ended, [[Ellinikon International Airport|Athens]], [[Greece]] and on to destinations in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atcroutes-1sep1945.jpg |title=Map of worldwide routes of Air Transport Command, September 1945 |work=Wikimedia Commons |year=1945 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209172722/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atcroutes-1sep1945.jpg |archive-date=9 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhen American forces left the base at the end of the war, the Civil Aviation Authority took over the facility and began using it for international civil aviation. In 1963, Cairo International Airport replaced the old Heliopolis Airport, which had been located at the Hike-Step area in the east of Cairo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history.asp |title=Airport History |work=Cairo International Airport |year=2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013060524/http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history.asp |archive-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe airport is administered by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, which controls the Cairo Airport Company, the Egyptian Airports Company, National Air Navigation Services and Aviation Information Technology, and the Cairo Airport Authority. In 2004, [[Fraport AG]] won the management contract to run the airport for eight years, with options to extend the contract twice in one-year increments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fraport.com/cms/press_center/dok/31/31283.fraport_ag_wins_management_contract_for.htm |title=Fraport AG Wins Management Contract for Cairo Airport in Egypt |work=Fraport AG |date=20 December 2004 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123065022/http://www.fraport.com/cms/press_center/dok/31/31283.fraport_ag_wins_management_contract_for.htm |archivedate=23 January 2009  }}</ref>\n\n==Terminals==\nThe terminal facilities include Departure Hall 1, International Hall 3, and Hall 4 for private and non-commercial aircraft services. As part of the recent upgrading and facility improvement scheme, the CAA demolished the old Hall 3, previously used for domestic arrivals and departures, to reconstruct a new hall to be used for international arrivals. Terminal 1 is locally known as the \"Old Airport,\" although its facilities were recently given a complete overhaul and are newer than those of Terminal 2, which is still known as the \"New Airport.\"\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 was originally used by EgyptAir and several Middle Eastern airlines. However, an increasing number of other foreign carriers, such as [[Air France]] and [[KLM]] transferred operations from Terminal 2 in 2006. In May 2009 [[EgyptAir]] moved all its operations to the new Terminal 3 (along with all [[Star Alliance]] airlines serving the airport). In March 2010, with the closure of Terminal 2 for major renovation works, all non-Star Alliance airlines serving the airport shifted operations to the terminal.\n\nDepartures and arrivals are with all airlines departing from Terminal 1 Hall 1, with the exception [[Saudia]] which is the sole tenant of Terminal 1 Hall 2 due to the size of their operations (SV accounted for 65% of Terminal 2's traffic in 2009). Most international airlines arrive in Hall 3. Arrival Hall 2 was recently reopened and serves international and domestic arrivals.\n\nThe CAC has inaugurated the \"Airport City Concept\" to provide an array of services and entertainment facilities to travelers, airport visitors, as well as the general public. The first phase, a new shopping mall called the 'AirMall,' has been built near Terminal 1's International Arrival Hall 3.\n\nAs of 2009 the facade of the terminal was being upgraded. A study on reorganizing the departure and arrival halls is ongoing as well as the feasibility study to include contact stands to improve the service and comfort levels to the passengers. Terminal 1 has 12 gates.\n\n====Hall 4====\nTerminal 1, Hall 4 is dedicated to private and executive jet services. Even though it is referred to as a 'Hall' under Terminal 1 it is operated independently from the commercial passenger terminal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n[[Smart Aviation Company]] has been based at the building since 2007; it moved to a new executive FBO in 2010 adjacent to Hall 4.[[File:CairoAirport-Terminal1.JPG|thumb|Departures area at Terminal 1]]\n\n===Terminal 2===\n\n[[File:CAI T2 20200110.jpg|thumb|Cairo Duty-Free at Cairo Airport Terminal 2]]\n\nTerminal 2 was inaugurated in 1986 with 7 boarding gates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history2.asp |title=Airport History |work=Cairo International Airport |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041113174604/http://www.cairo-airport.com/airport_history2.asp |archive-date=13 November 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It primarily served European, Gulf and East Asian airlines. The terminal was closed in April 2010 for complete renovations starting in 2012 and lasting 36 months. The architecture of the building limited the opportunities for further expansion which necessitated the entire building to be closed for major structural overhaul at an estimated cost of approximately $400 million.\n\nIn February 2010 the [[World Bank]]'s Board of Executive Directors approved a loan amount of $387 million to support the Cairo Airport Development Project (CADP) to overhaul the terminal with national banks providing the rest. The project aimed at increasing the terminal capacity from 3 million to 7.5 million passengers annually. The upgrade included the complete modernization of the 20-year-old facility to reach the same level of service as the new Terminal 3. In August 2011, Turkey's [[Limak Holding]] won the tender for modernizing the terminal.\n\nAfter several project delays, the renovated terminal had its soft opening on 28 September 2016 with a capacity of 7.5 million passengers bringing the airport's total passenger capacity to 30 million passengers annually. The new terminal has 14 gates and an additional 5 remote stands.[[File:Nile_Air_A320_in_Special_'Egypt_Tourism'_Livery_(2016).jpg|thumb|right|Nile Air [[Airbus A320]] Special ' Egypt Tourism' Livery at Cairo International Airport (June 2016)]][[File:Gate at Terminal 3 Cairo International Airport - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Gate at Terminal 3 Cairo International Airport]]During February 2017, Saudi Arabian Airlines launched its first international \"Al-Fursan lounge\" at Cairo International Airport Terminal 2. The 1,500 square-meter lounge can accommodate 300 people at a time.\n\nThe renovated terminal is operating jointly with Terminal 3 as one integrated terminal via an air bridge, thus, reinforcing the role of Cairo International Airport as a regional hub.\n\n===Terminal 3===\nGiven projected growth, and the limited ability to expand Terminal 2, the [[Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation]] began construction of Terminal 3 in 2004. The terminal was officially inaugurated on 18 December 2008 and opened for commercial operations on 27 April 2009. The facility is twice as large as the current two terminal buildings combined, with the capacity to handle 11 million passengers annually (6 million international and 5 million domestic) once the first phase is completed. It is adjacent to Terminal 2, and the two terminals are initially connected by a bridge.\n\nWith its hub at the airport, EgyptAir's operations were overhauled with the full transfer of its operations (international and domestic) into the new terminal between 27 April and 15 June 2009. To implement the [[Star Alliance]] \"Move Under One Roof\" concept, all Alliance members serving the airport were relocated to the terminal by the first of August 2009.\n\nThe new terminal includes:\n\n* Two piers of extendable capacity and gates facilities serving domestic and international traffic on contact and remote stands. The main building and the piers are connected by concourses. Two of the gates are equipped to handle Airbus A380 aircraft. Provisions for a third pier are in the planning stages.\n* Terminal 3 has 23 gates (2 gates for the A380), 6 check-in islands consisting of 110 check-in counters (plus 10 mobile counters and 10 CUSS kiosks), 76 immigration counters (plus 5 biometric gates), 52 contact and remote aircraft parking stands (5 with multiple uses), 425 FIDS, 15 public information points, 7 baggage carousels, 63 elevators, 50 moving walkways and 51 escalators.\n* Retails space covers more than 5,000m<sup>2</sup> (4.034m<sup>2</sup> occupied by [[EgyptAir]] Tourism & Duty Free Shops).\n*[[File:CairoIntlAirportT3DutyFree.jpg|alt=|thumb|T3 Duty free area]]International food court with Oriental, Asian and Western food (incl. [[Burger King]], Hippopotamus, [[Upper Crust (restaurant chain)|Upper Crust]]).\n*Landside roads including bridges and fly-over serving the traffic to and from the terminal building, surface car park areas (multi-story parking garage capable of holding more than 3,000 cars), a new access road connecting the airport with the Autostrad road (Cairo ring road) and upgrading the access roads.\n\n===Seasonal flight terminal===\nOn 20 September 2011 Prime Minister Sharaf inaugurated the new Seasonal Flights Terminal (ST), located west of Terminal 3. During the start-up phase EgyptAir operates its daily flight to Medina from the new Terminal. All [[Hajj]] traffic of EgyptAir will move to the ST while Saudia's Hajj flights will still operate from Terminal 1. More destinations might be added during winter.\n\nThe terminal has an annual capacity of 3.2 million passengers with 27 check-in counters and 7 gates with a common gate and single security concept, the first in Cairo. It is designed to handle 1,200 passengers per hour. Passengers will be bussed to remote aircraft stands around Terminal 3. Its purpose is to ease operational strains on the existing terminals during pilgrim seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/?=58031 |title= State Information Service |work= sis.gov.eg |access-date= 8 February 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141003014109/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/?=58031 |archive-date= 3 October 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Cairo International Airport.JPG|alt=|thumb|Airport entrance]]\nThe airport has four terminals, the third (and largest) opened on 27 April 2009 and the Seasonal Flights Terminal opened on 20 September 2011.

The new line, Line 3, which is in an advanced stage of execution, will link [[Greater Cairo]] from east to west with the airport at one end, and [[Mohandessin]] district at the other. It is expected to be fully operational by 2019.{{update after|2015|12|31}}\n* Development of real estate and the '' 'Oasis Project' '' which entails a business park with company headquarters and regional offices.\n* Construction of'' 'Aerocity''', a family leisure park to be built within the airport's investment zone. With an area of {{convert|3|km2}}, the enterprise should cost 1 billion Egyptian pounds (US$183 million) and will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will consist of the building of a business center, and the second, of an entertainment park following the guidelines of Disney World, in the United States. There will also be parks, artificial lake, game courts, a water park, 18 cinemas and several restaurants.

The most convenient way is by one of the numerous \"limousine services\". Pick-up points are in front of the terminals (curb side). The prices are fixed depending on the destination and the car category, but different providers may charge wildly different prices. Category A are luxury limousines (e.g. [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]]), Category B are Micro Buses for up to seven passengers, Category C are midsized cars (e.g. [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]) and new Category D are [[TX4|London Taxis]].<ref>Cairo Airport Company (2010): \"Limousine Information\".

His father, J\u00e1nos Orb\u00e1n, Baron of Lengyelfalva (1779-1871) was a parliamentarian, who during the [[French wars]] was an army officer; his mother was Eug\u00e9nia Knechtel (1810-1883). According to Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n\u2019s memoir, he was a descendant of a family half [[Upper Hungary|Upper Hungarian]], half [[Italian]] (or [[Greek]]) from [[Istanbul]]. The Baron title was given by [[Maria Theresa]] to the great-grandfather of Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n, Elek Orb\u00e1n von Lengyelfalva on the 13th of November 1744.\n[[File:1890-17 Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs.JPG|thumb|421x421px|Photo of Baron Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n in The Sunday Newspaper, 1890/17th edition]]\nHe completed his schooling in [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]], first to a catholic then to a reformed grammar school as he could learn [[ancient Greek]], Math, and History there, but he had left his homeland already in the summer of 1846. He and his family traveled to [[Constantinople]] to receive the heritage of his grandmother, M\u00e1ria Foresti, who was descended from [[Venice]] and probably poisoned by [[Muslims]]. After long lawsuits he only received a small part of the fabulous fortune, so he learned the craft of [[Watchmaker|watchmaking]]. Taking the opportunity, he traveled around the [[Near East]]. He had got to [[Egypt]], where he climbed the [[Pyramid|pyramids]], in the [[Holy Land]] visited the biblical places, met a lot of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] \u201c[[Bedouin]]\u201d from [[Transylvania]], who escaped the military conscription, traveled around [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], studied the ancient Greek cultural remains, wrote admiringly about the revolution of the Greek people. He later published his Eastern adventures in six volumes, entitled Traveling in the East. As a result of what he has seen here, he had adopted strongly [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] views, which he has voiced in several of his works.\n\n\nHe learned about the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] from a Western newspaper in [[Athens]]. He left the [[Turkish]] capital with a military unit of volunteers but learned of the fall of the [[War of independence|War of Independence]] in [[Vidin]]. He then helped the [[Hungarian]] emigrants with accommodation and work. It was a decisive experience of his later life that he was in the surroundings of Kossuth. He could not return home, because he was considered as an enemy by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] imperial authorities. He traveled to [[London]], where he met [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi|Pet\u0151fi]]'s friend, [https://familypedia.wikia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ndor_Teleki_de_Sz%C3%A9k_(1821-1892) S\u00e1ndor Teleki]. He was greatly influenced by [[Victor Hugo]], who migrated to [[Jersey]] and then to [[Guernsey]], who said that \u201cI could overthrow [[Napoleon III|The Empire of Napoleon the 3rd]] with 200 Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1ns\u201d. He could not return home until 1859. He used the years of [[absolutism]], the period of relief, to travel around the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]]. He visited all the settlements, castle ruins, natural rarities. He made notes and photographs diligently. As a result of his work, between 1868 and 1873 he published his main work in six volumes, entitled The description of the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] in historical, archaeological, natural and ethnographic terms.\n\nFrom 1872 to the end of his life he was a member of the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Hungarian Parliament]], and with the independence program of 1848, he belonged to the opposition. He published his speeches in six volumes as well. Meanwhile, he worked on Szejkef\u00fcrd\u0151 that he built, writing historical studies and publishing numerous newspaper articles in opposition papers.[[File:Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs arck\u00e9pe.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Portrait of Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n]]His life was adventurous and romantic, like a hero of [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. But this novel was not written, although [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]] first heard the base stories of the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely]] novels from him. At the same time, there were downsides to his life as well. He was blackballed by [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] at the time of the elections, they did not always agree with the \u201cbone Baron\u201d. As a late acknowledgment, it was not until 1888 that he became a correspondent member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He died without any descendants.\n<br />\n\n== Membership ==\n<br />\n\n* [[:hu:Kem\u00e9ny_Zsigmond_T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g|Kem\u00e9ny Zsigmond Society]]\n\n<br />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\nHe made his only heirs the [[Hungarians]], and more specifically the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely people]], but there were long lawsuits over his legacy. At his funeral was decided that he deserves a statue, but it had to wait more than a century until 1995. According to his will, he was buried in Szejkef\u00fcrd\u0151. A row of [[Wood carving#/media/File:Szekelykapuk1214.JPG|Sz\u00e9kely gates]] was put up in front of his grave, the last of which was his.\n[[File:Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs.jpg|thumb|317x317px|Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n\u2019s honorary monument at his grave]]\nIn [[Cristuru Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelykereszt\u00far]] a school, in [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]] a school and a photography club are named after him.

His father, J\u00e1nos Orb\u00e1n, Baron of Lengyelfalva (1779-1871) was a parliamentarian, who during the [[French wars]] was an army officer; his mother was Eug\u00e9nia Knechtel (1810-1883). According to Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n\u2019s memoir, he was a descendant of a family half [[Upper Hungary|Upper Hungarian]], half [[Italian]] (or [[Greek]]) from [[Istanbul]]. The Baron title was given by [[Maria Theresa]] to the great-grandfather of Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n, Elek Orb\u00e1n von Lengyelfalva on the 13th of November 1744.\n[[File:1890-17 Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs.JPG|thumb|421x421px|Photo of Baron Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n in The Sunday Newspaper, 1890/17th edition]]\n[[File:Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs arck\u00e9pe.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Portrait of Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n]]\nHe completed his schooling in [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]], first to a catholic then to a reformed grammar school as he could learn [[ancient Greek]], Math, and History there, but he had left his homeland already in the summer of 1846. He and his family traveled to [[Constantinople]] to receive the heritage of his grandmother, M\u00e1ria Foresti, who was descended from [[Venice]] and probably poisoned by [[Muslims]]. After long lawsuits he only received a small part of the fabulous fortune, so he learned the craft of [[Watchmaker|watchmaking]]. Taking the opportunity, he traveled around the [[Near East]]. He had got to [[Egypt]], where he climbed the [[Pyramid|pyramids]], in the [[Holy Land]] visited the biblical places, met a lot of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] \u201c[[Bedouin]]\u201d from [[Transylvania]], who escaped the military conscription, traveled around [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], studied the ancient Greek cultural remains, wrote admiringly about the revolution of the Greek people. He later published his Eastern adventures in six volumes, entitled Traveling in the East. As a result of what he has seen here, he had adopted strongly [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] views, which he has voiced in several of his works.\n\n\nHe learned about the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] from a Western newspaper in [[Athens]]. He left the [[Turkish]] capital with a military unit of volunteers but learned of the fall of the [[War of independence|War of Independence]] in [[Vidin]]. He then helped the [[Hungarian]] emigrants with accommodation and work. It was a decisive experience of his later life that he was in the surroundings of Kossuth. He could not return home, because he was considered as an enemy by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] imperial authorities. He traveled to [[London]], where he met [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi|Pet\u0151fi]]'s friend, [https://familypedia.wikia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ndor_Teleki_de_Sz%C3%A9k_(1821-1892) S\u00e1ndor Teleki]. He was greatly influenced by [[Victor Hugo]], who migrated to [[Jersey]] and then to [[Guernsey]], who said that \u201cI could overthrow [[Napoleon III|The Empire of Napoleon the 3rd]] with 200 Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1ns\u201d. He could not return home until 1859. He used the years of [[absolutism]], the period of relief, to travel around the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]]. He visited all the settlements, castle ruins, natural rarities. He made notes and photographs diligently. As a result of his work, between 1868 and 1873 he published his main work in six volumes, entitled The description of the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] in historical, archaeological, natural and ethnographic terms.\n\nFrom 1872 to the end of his life he was a member of the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Hungarian Parliament]], and with the independence program of 1848, he belonged to the opposition. He published his speeches in six volumes as well. Meanwhile, he worked on Szejkef\u00fcrd\u0151 that he built, writing historical studies and publishing numerous newspaper articles in opposition papers.\n\nHis life was adventurous and romantic, like a hero of [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]]. But this novel was not written, although [[M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai]] first heard the base stories of the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely]] novels from him. At the same time, there were downsides to his life as well. He was blackballed by [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] at the time of the elections, they did not always agree with the \u201cbone Baron\u201d. As a late acknowledgment, it was not until 1888 that he became a correspondent member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He died without any descendants.\n<br />\n\n== Membership ==\n<br />\n\n* [[:hu:Kem\u00e9ny_Zsigmond_T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g|Kem\u00e9ny Zsigmond Society]]\n\n<br />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\nHe made his only heirs the [[Hungarians]], and more specifically the [[Sz\u00e9kelys|Sz\u00e9kely people]], but there were long lawsuits over his legacy. At his funeral was decided that he deserves a statue, but it had to wait more than a century until 1995. According to his will, he was buried in Szejkef\u00fcrd\u0151. A row of [[Wood carving#/media/File:Szekelykapuk1214.JPG|Sz\u00e9kely gates]] was put up in front of his grave, the last of which was his.\n[[File:Orb\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs.jpg|thumb|317x317px|Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n\u2019s honorary monument at his grave]]\nIn [[Cristuru Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelykereszt\u00far]] a school, in [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]] a school and a photography club are named after him.

At the second by-election in February 1775 the returning officer disqualified 108 of his opponent\u2019s votes. Peach was initially returned as  [[Member of Parliament]] on 4 March 1775 but there was a petition and he was unseated on 19 February 1776.<ref name = HOP/> \n\nPeach was a Director of the East India Company again from 1776 to 1779.  In 1777, he was involved in the  prosecution of  [[William Dodd (priest)|Dr. Dodd]], who was subsequently hanged for forgery. In 1780, Peach contested [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] but was  defeated. He was Director of the East India Company in 1781, but then went bankrupt and was disqualified.\n\nHe died on 14 December 1790.<ref name = HOP/> Peach had a cousin, also Samuel Peach, a merchant of Bristol whose daughter married [[Henry Cruger]], MP.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[William Earle (MP)|William Earle]]\n | before2 = [[Arnold Nesbitt (MP)|Arnold Nesbitt]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]]\n | years =   1775\u20131776  \n | with  =  [[Arnold Nesbitt (MP)|Arnold Nesbitt]]\n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[John Dewar (MP)|John Dewar]]\n | after2 = [[Arnold Nesbitt (MP)|Arnold Nesbitt]]\n}}\n\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peach, Samuel }}\n[[Category:1725 births]]\n[[Category:1790 deaths]]\n[[Category:British merchants]]\n[[Category:British bankers]]\n[[Category:Directors of the British East India Company]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1774\u20131780]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Peach"}
