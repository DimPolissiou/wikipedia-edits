He notes, however, that the categories are somewhat contrived and overlapping, and some cultures have more kinds, including the French with twenty and the Germans with thirty.<ref name=Nyrop>Nyrop, Christoper. ''The Kiss and its History'', Sands & Co., London (1901) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UQgNAAAAYAAJ Read full text]</ref>\n\n=== Expression of affection ===\nKissing another person's lips has become a common expression of affection or warm greeting in many cultures worldwide. Yet in certain cultures, kissing was introduced only through European settlement, before which it was not a routine occurrence. Such cultures include certain indigenous peoples of Australia, the Tahitians, and many tribes in Africa.<ref name=Dyer>Dyer, Tristeleton T.F. \"The History of Kissing\", ''The American Magazine'', vol. 14 1882, pp. 611\u2013614</ref>\n\nA kiss can also be used to express feelings without an erotic element but can be nonetheless \"far deeper and more lasting\", writes Nyrop. He adds that such kisses can be expressive of love \"in the widest and most comprehensive meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|79}}\n\nNyrop writes that the most common example is the \"intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring\", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between other members of the same family, which can include those outside the immediate family circle, \"everywhere where deep affection unites people.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82}} The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Esau met Jacob after a long separation, he ran towards him, fell on his neck, and kissed him ({{bible verse|Genesis|33:4|HE}}), [[Moses]] greeted his father-in-law and kissed him ({{bible verse|Exodus|18:7|HE}}), and [[Orpah]] kissed her mother-in-law before leaving her ({{bible verse|Ruth|1:4|HE}}). The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], as when [[Odysseus]], on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82\u201383}}\n\nAffection can be a cause of kissing \"in all ages in grave and solemn moments,\" notes Nyrop, \"not only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of profound gratitude. When the [[Apostle Paul]] took leave of the elders of the congregation at [[Ephesus]], \"they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him\" (Acts 20:37). Kisses can also be exchanged between total strangers, as when there is a profound sympathy with or the warmest interest in another person.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|85}}\n\n[[Folk poetry]] has been the source of affectionate kisses where they sometimes played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the \"redeeming power of the kiss are to be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her.\" In the reverse situation, in the tale of \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|95\u201396}}\n\nA kiss of affection can also take place after death. In {{bible verse|Genesis|50:1|HE}}, it is written that when Jacob was dead, \"Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him.\" And it is told of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Muhammad]]'s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when the prophet was dead, he went into the latter's tent, uncovered his face, and kissed him. Nyrop writes that \"the kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved, and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether world.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|97}}\n\nKissing on the lips can be a physical expression of affection or love between two people in which the sensations of touch, taste, and smell are involved.<ref name=Brayer /> According to the psychologist Menachem Brayer, although many \"mammals, birds, and insects exchange caresses\" which appear to be kisses of affection, they are not kisses in the human sense.\n\nSurveys indicate that kissing is the second most common form of [[physical intimacy]] among United States adolescents (after [[holding hands]]), and that about 85% of 15 to 16-year-old adolescents in the US have experienced it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00061-0 |pmid=10706169 |title=Smart teens don't have sex (or kiss much either) |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213\u201325 |year=2000 |last1=Halpern |first1=Carolyn Tucker |last2=Joyner |first2=Kara |last3=Udry |first3=J.Richard |last4=Suchindran |first4=Chirayath }}</ref>\n\n=== Kiss on the lips ===\nThe kiss on the lips can be performed between two [[friend]]s or family.

These games serve as icebreakers at parties and may be some participants' first exposure to sexuality. There are many such games, including [[Truth or Dare?]], [[Seven Minutes in Heaven]] (or the variation \"Two Minutes in the Closet\"), [[spin the bottle|Spin the Bottle]], [[Post Office (game)|Post Office]], and Wink. Many [[pre-teens]], teenagers, and [[young adults]] consider that a first kiss implies maturity. It is almost thought of as a coming-of-age rite of passage type of action. In some cases, teenagers use it against each other(e.g.:You're 14 and haven't had your first kiss so you can't hang out with us anymore!).\n\nThe psychologist William Cane notes that kissing in [[Western world|Western]] society is often a romantic act and describes a few of its attributes:\n{{quotation|It's not hard to tell when two people are in love. Maybe they're trying to hide it from the world, still they cannot conceal their inner excitement. Men will give themselves away by a certain excited trembling in the muscles of the lower jaw upon seeing their beloved. Women will often turn pale immediately of seeing their lover and then get slightly red in the face as their sweetheart draws near. This is the effect of physical closeness upon two people who are in love.<ref name=Cane>Cane, William. ''The Art of Kissing'', Macmillan (1991)</ref>{{Rp|9}}}}\n\n[[File:USS Oak Hill (LSD 51) First Kiss 111221-N-JP983-008.jpg|thumb|Two women belonging to the US Navy who are formally in a relationship kiss in public upon meeting after a long time, 2011.]]\nRomantic kissing in Western cultures is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature. In the Middle Ages it became a social gesture and was considered a sign of refinement of the upper classes.<ref name=Brayer>Brayer, Menachem M. ''The Jewish Woman in Rabbinic Literature'', KTAV Publishing House (1986)</ref>{{Rp|150\u2013151}} Other cultures have different definitions and uses of kissing, notes Brayer. In [[China]], for example, a similar expression of affection consists of rubbing one's nose against the cheek of another person. In other Eastern cultures kissing is not common. In South East Asian countries the \"sniff kiss\" is the most common form of affection and Western [[Human mouth|mouth]] to mouth kissing is often reserved for sexual foreplay. In some tribal cultures the \"equivalent for our 'kiss me' is 'smell me.'\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe kiss can be an important expression of love and [[eroticism|erotic]] emotions. In his book ''The Kiss and its History'', Kristoffer Nyrop describes the kiss of love as an \"exultant message of the longing of love, love eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the lovers' lips, and 'rises,' as Charles Fuster has said, 'up to the blue sky from the green plains,' like a tender, trembling thank-offering.\" Nyrop adds that the love kiss, \"rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all other earthly joys in sublimity.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|30}} He also compares it to achievements in life: \"Thus even the highest work of art, yet, the loftiest reputation, is nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|31}}\n\nThe power of a kiss is not minimized when he writes that \"we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss ...\" Kissing, he implies, can lead one to maturity: \"It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers,\" and can keep one feeling young: \"It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth.\" The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: \"In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss,\" and \"man craves for it as his noblest reward.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|37}}\n\nAs a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new. Nyrop gives a vivid example in the classic love story of [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. As a reward \"Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis\u2014an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock\":<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|47}}\n{{quotation|Ye gods, what are my feelings.

My pulse is beating fast, my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet, nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?}}\nRomantic kissing \"requires more than simple proximity,\" notes Cane. It also needs \"some degree of intimacy or privacy, ... which is why you'll see lovers stepping to the side of a busy street or sidewalk.\"<ref name=Cane /> Psychologist [[Wilhelm Reich]] \"lashed out at society\" for not giving young lovers enough privacy and making it difficult to be alone.<ref name=Cane /> However, Cane describes how many lovers manage to attain romantic privacy despite being in a public setting, as they \"lock their minds together\" and thereby create an invisible sense of \"psychological privacy.\" He adds, \"In this way they can kiss in public even in a crowded plaza and keep it romantic.\"<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}} Nonetheless, when Cane asked people to describe the most romantic places they ever kissed, \"their answers almost always referred to this ends-of-the-earth isolation, ... they mentioned an apple orchard, a beach, out in a field looking at the stars, or at a pond in a secluded area ...\"<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}}\n\n== Kiss as ritual ==\n[[File:Maestranza-1.jpg|thumb|Kiss on the crucifix in Catholicism]]\n[[File:Denis Thatcher Nancy Reagan 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Thatcher]], husband of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Hand-kissing|kissing the hand]] of [[Nancy Reagan]] wife of Former US President in 1988]]\n[[File:Kiss the Blarney Stone.jpg|thumb|Kissing the [[Blarney Stone]]]]\n\nThroughout history, a kiss has been a ritual, formal, symbolic or social gesture indicating devotion, respect or greeting. It appears as a ritual or symbol of religious devotion. For example, in the case of kissing a temple floor, or a religious book or icon. Besides devotion, a kiss has also indicated subordination or, nowadays, respect.\n\nIn modern times the practice continues, as in the case of a bride and groom kissing at the conclusion of a wedding ceremony or national leaders kissing each other in greeting, and in many other situations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nA kiss in a religious context is common. In earlier periods of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] kissing became a ritual gesture, and is still treated as such in certain customs, as when \"kissing... relics, or a bishop's ring.\"<ref name=Brayer /> In [[Judaism]], the kissing of the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]], a [[Siddur|prayer book]], and a [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] is also common.<ref>Kuraweil, Arthur.''The Torah for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing (2008) p. 218</ref> Crawley notes that it was \"very significant of the affectionate element in religion\" to give so important a part to the kiss as part of its ritual. In the early Church the baptized were kissed by the celebrant after the ceremony, and its use was even extended as a salute to saints and religious heroes, with Crawley adding, \"Thus Joseph kissed Jacob, and his disciples kissed Paul. Joseph kissed his dead father, and the custom was retained in our civilization\", as the farewell kiss on dead relatives, although certain sects prohibit this today.<ref name=Crawley>Crawley, Ernest. ''Studies of Savages and Sex'', Kessinger Publishing (revised and reprinted) (2006)</ref>{{Rp|126}}\n\nA distinctive element in the Christian [[liturgy]] was noted by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] in the 2nd century, now referred to as the \"[[kiss of peace]],\" and once part of the rite in the primitive Mass. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] has stated that this act originated within the ancient Hebrew [[synagogue]], and [[Philo]], the ancient Jewish philosopher called it a \"kiss of harmony\", where, as Crawley explains, \"the Word of God brings hostile things together in concord and the kiss of love.\"<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}} [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Saint Cyril]] also writes, \"this kiss is the sign that our souls are united, and that we banish all remembrance of injury.\"<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}}\n\n=== Kiss of peace ===\nNyrop notes that the [[kiss of peace]] was used as an expression of deep, spiritual devotion in the [[early Christian Church]]. Christ said, for instance, \"Peace be with you, my peace I give you,\" and the members of Christ's Church gave each other peace symbolically through a kiss. [[St Paul]] repeatedly speaks of the \"holy kiss,\" and, in his [[Epistle]] to the Romans, writes: \"Salute one another with an holy kiss\" and his first Epistle to the Thessalonians ([[1 Thessalonians]] 5:26), he says: \"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|101}}\n\nThe kiss of peace was also used in [[secular]] festivities. During the [[Middle Ages]], for example, Nyrop points out that it was the custom to \"seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a kiss.\" Even knights gave each other the kiss of peace before proceeding to the combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs. The holy kiss was also found in the ritual of the Church on solemn occasions, such as baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or obsequies. However, toward the end of the Middle Ages the kiss of peace disappears as the official token of reconciliation.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|109}}\n\n=== Kiss of respect ===\n[[File:Re-enactment at the Seashore (5851205620) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man kissing the ground after a long sea voyage (as part of a reenactment of the first landing of English settlers in Virginia in 1607)]]\nThe kiss of respect is of ancient origin, notes Nyrop. He writes that \"from the remotest times we find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful\u2014to the gods, their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors; out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon were greeted with kisses.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|114}}\n\nHe notes some examples, as \"when the prophet [[Hosea]] laments over the idolatry of the children of [[Israel]], he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them\" ({{bible verse|Hosea|13:2|HE}}). In classical times similar homage was often paid to the gods, and people were known to kiss the hands, knees, feet, and the mouths, of their idols. [[Cicero]] writes that the lips and beard of the famous statue of [[Hercules]] at [[Agrigentum]] were worn away by the kisses of devotees.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|115}}\n\nPeople kissed the cross with the image of Jesus, and such kissing of the cross is always considered a holy act. In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that \"as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed.\" Kissing the cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and the pictures and statues of saints\u2014not only their pictures, \"but even their relics are kissed,\" notes Nyrop. \"They make both soul and body whole.\" There are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their health by kissing relics, he points out.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|121}}\n\nThe kiss of respect has also represented a mark of fealty, humility and reverence. Its use in ancient times was widespread, and Nyrop gives examples: \"people threw themselves down on the ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally 'licked the dust,' as it is termed.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|124}} \"Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe the kiss of respect. The Roman slaves kissed the hands of their masters; pupils and soldiers those of their teachers and captains respectively.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|124}} People also kissed the earth for joy on returning to their native land after a lengthened absence, as when [[Agamemnon]] returned from the [[Trojan War]].\n\n=== Kiss of friendship ===\nThe kiss is also commonly used in American and European culture as a salutation between friends or acquaintances. The friendly kiss until recent times usually occurred only between ladies, but today it is also common between men and women, especially if there is a great difference in age. According to Nyrop, up until the 20th century, \"it seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of royal personages,\" although he notes that in former times the \"friendly kiss was very common with us between man and man as well as between persons of opposite sexes.\" In guilds, for example, it was customary for the members to greet each other \"with hearty [[handshake]]s and smacking kisses,\" and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed both their hosts and hostesses.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|142}}\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nIn approximately 10% of the world population, kissing does not take place, for a variety of reasons, including that they find it dirty or because of superstitious reasons. For example, in parts of [[Sudan]] it is believed that the mouth is the portal to the soul, so they do not want to invite death or have their spirit taken.<ref name=demirjian /> Psychology professor [[Elaine Hatfield]] noted that \"kissing was far from universal and even seen as improper by many societies.\"<ref name=India>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-india-kisses-are-on-rise-even-in-public.html?_r=0 \"In India, Kisses Are on Rise, Even in Public\"], ''New York Times'', Feb. 13, 2013</ref> Despite kissing being widespread, in some parts of the world it still is taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.\n\n=== As a theme in art===\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"225px\">\nFile:Romeo and Juliet (detail) by Frank Dicksee.png|''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' <br>by Sir [[Frank Bernard Dicksee|Frank Dicksee]]\nFile:Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard - The Stolen Kiss.jpg|[[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] <br>''[[The Stolen Kiss (Fragonard)|The Stolen Kiss]]'' (1786)\nFile:El Beso (Pinacoteca de Brera, Mil\u00e1n, 1859).jpg|''[[The Kiss (Hayez)|The Kiss]]'' <br>by [[Francesco Hayez]] (1859)\nFile:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - A Little Coaxing (1890).jpg|''A Little Coaxing''<br />by [[William Bouguereau]] (1890)\nFile:Amor und Psyche Ausschnitt Louvre.jpg|''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' <br>by [[Antonio Canova]]\nFile:The Kiss.JPG|''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|Le Baiser]]'' (\"The Kiss\") <br>by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1882)\n</gallery>\n\n=== South Asia ===\nOn-screen lip-kissing was not a regular occurrence in [[Bollywood]] until the 1990s, although it has been present from the time of the inception of Bollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/90948.html|title=Bollywood most passionate kisses of all times|publisher=}}</ref> This can appear contradictory since the culture of kissing is believed to have originated and spread from India.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/11/01/a-short-history-of-the-kiss-in-india/|title=A Short History of the Kiss in India|first=Atish|last=Patel|date=1 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== West Asia ===\nThere are also taboos as to whom one can kiss in some [[Muslim]]-majority societies governed by religious law.

When lips are pressed together for an extended period, usually accompanied with an [[hug|embrace]], it is an expression of romantic and sexual desire. The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their [[tongue]] into their mouth, is called [[French kiss]]ing. \"[[Making out]]\" is often an [[adolescent]]'s first experience of their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and games which involve kissing, such as [[Spin the Bottle]], facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.\n\nIn modern [[Eastern culture]], the etiquette vary depending on the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a baby on the cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.\n\n=== Kissing in films ===\nThe first romantic kiss on screen was in American silent films in 1896, beginning with the film ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]''. The kiss lasted 18 seconds and caused many to rail against decadence in the new medium of silent film. Writer [[Louis Black]] writes that \"it was the United States that brought kissing out of the Dark Ages.\"<ref name=Texas>''Texas Monthly'', Feb. 1980 p. 143</ref> However, it met with severe disapproval by defenders of public morality, especially in New York. One critic proclaimed that \"it is absolutely disgusting. Such things call for police interference.\"<ref name=Texas />\n\n[[File:Rock Hudson - Julie Andrews.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rock Hudson]] and [[Julie Andrews]] kissing in film ''[[Darling Lilli]]'' (1968)]]\nYoung moviegoers began emulating romantic stars on the screen, such as [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]], the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, traveling up her arm, and then kissing her on the back of her neck. Actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like [[Nazimova]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Vilma B\u00e1nky]] and [[Greta Garbo]], became screen idols as a result.\n\nEventually the film industry began to adopt the dictates of the [[Production Code]] established in 1934, overseen by [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] and supported by the church{{Which|date=June 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the new code, \"Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown.\"<ref name=Texas /> As a result, kissing scenes were shortened, with scenes cut away, leaving the imagination of the viewer to take over. Under the code, actors kissing had to keep their feet on the ground and had to be either standing or sitting.<ref name=Citron>Citron, Lana. ''A Compendium of Kisses'', Harlequin Publ. (2010) p. 177</ref>\n\nThe heyday of romantic kissing on the screen took place in the early sound era, during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWKOctKUVGQ Kissing scenes in the classic movies]</ref>{{rp|watch}} Body language began to be used to supplement romantic scenes, especially with the eyes, a talent that added to Greta Garbo's fame. Author [[Lana Citron]] writes that \"men were perceived as the kissers and women the receivers. Should the roles ever be reversed, women were regarded as vamps . . .\"<ref name=Citron /> According to Citron, [[Mae West]] and [[Anna May Wong]] were the only Hollywood actresses never to have been kissed on screen.<ref name=Citron /> Among the films rated for having the most romantic kisses are ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.<ref name=Citron />\n\nSociologist Eva Illouz notes that surveys taken in 1935 showed that \"love was the most important theme represented in movies. Similar surveys during the 1930s found the 95% of films had romance as one of their plot lines, what film critics called \"the romantic formula.\"<ref name=Illouz>Illouz, Eva. ''Consuming the Romantic Utopia'', Univ. of Calif. Press (1997) p. 31</ref>\n\nIn early Japanese films, kissing and sexual expression were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), but when the film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested \"we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?\" Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were \"sneaky\", claiming that \"if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too.\"<ref>Kyoko Hirano, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: The Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945\u20131952'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1992), pp 154\u201357, 162</ref>\n\n=== Non-sexual kisses ===\n[[File:Fanciful_sketch_by_Marguerite_Martyn_of_a_New_Years_Eve_celebration.jpg|thumb|right|People kissing in this sketch by reporter and artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of a [[New Year's Eve]] celebration in 1914]]\nIn some Western cultures it is considered [[luck|good luck]] to kiss someone on [[Christmas]] or on [[New Year's Eve]], especially beneath a sprig of [[mistletoe]].

A kiss can be \"blown\" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term ''flying kiss'' is used in India to describe a blown kiss.

Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of [[love]], [[Passion (emotion)|passion]], [[romance (love)|romance]], [[sexual attraction]], [[sexual activity]], [[sexual arousal]], [[affection]], [[respect]], [[greeting]], [[friendship]], [[peace]], and good luck, among many others. In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or [[sacrament]]. The word came from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:en:cyssan#Old English|cyssan]]'' (\"[[wikt:en:to kiss#en|to kiss]]\"), in turn from ''[[wikt:en:coss#Old English|coss]] '' (\"a kiss\").\n\n== History ==\n[[Anthropologist]]s are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing, one believing that it is [[instinct]]ual and intuitive, having evolved from activities like suckling, [[premastication]], or checking the health of a potential mate via inspecting their saliva, and the other believing that it is a learned behavior, spread by European explorers.<ref name=demirjian>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7348582 The (Mostly) Blissful History of Kissing], ''NPR'' February 11, 2007</ref>\n\nThe earliest reference to kissing-like behavior comes from the [[Vedas]], Sanskrit scriptures that informed [[Hinduism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150714-why-do-we-kiss?ocid=fbind|title=Why do humans kiss each other when most animals don't?}}</ref> [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], around 3,500 years ago, according to Vaughn Bryant, an anthropologist at Texas A&M University who specializes in the history of the kiss.<ref>[http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine\u2019s-day-story-starters/] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141204235151/http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine%E2%80%99s-day-story-starters/ |date=2014-12-04 }}</ref>\n\nBoth lip and tongue kissing are mentioned in [[Sumer]]ian poetry:<ref>{{cite book |last=Kramer |first=Samuel Noah |year=1981 |title=History Begins at Sumer |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-1276-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/humansideofjapan00tana/page/72 72ff] |edition=3rd revised. |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/humansideofjapan00tana/page/72 }}</ref>\n{{quote|My lips are too small, they know not to kiss.}}\n{{quote|My precious sweet, lying by my heart,<br />one by one \"tonguemaking,\" one by one.}}\n{{quote|When my sweet precious, my heart, had lain down too,<br />each of them in turn kissing with the tongue, each in turn.<ref>[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.4.08.04# The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature] Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford</ref>}}\n\nKissing is described in the surviving [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptian]] love poetry from the [[New Kingdom]], found on [[Papyrus|papyri]] excavated at [[Deir el-Medina]]:\n{{quote|Finally I will drink life from your lips <br />and wake up from this ever lasting sleep.}}\n{{quote|The wisdom of the earth in a kiss <br />and everything else in your eyes.}}\n{{quote|I kiss her before everyone <br />that they all may see my love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themagentahornet.com/ancient-poetry1.html|title=Ancient Poetry|work=TheMagentaHornet.com}}</ref>}}\n{{quote|And when her lips are pressed to mine <br />I am made drunk and need not wine.<br />When we kiss, and her warm lips half open,<br />I fly cloud-high without beer!}}\n{{quote|His kisses on my lips, my breast, my hair...<br />...Come!

Kissing the hand or cheek was called an {{lang|la|osculum}}. Kissing on the lips with mouth closed was called a {{lang|la|basium}}, which was used between relatives. A kiss of passion was called a {{lang|la|suavium}}.<ref name=\"Terry Jones\">Jones, Terry \"The Ancient World According to Terry Jones (Love and Sex)\" (1998)</ref>\n\nKissing was not always an indication of ''eros'', or love, but also could show respect and rank as it was used in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].\n\nThe study of kissing started sometime in the nineteenth century and is called '''philematology''', which has been studied by people including Cesare Lombroso, [[Ernest Crawley]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and modern scholars such as [[Elaine Hatfield]].<ref name=Kirshenbaum>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/14/opinion/kirshenbaum-science-kissing \"The science of kissing\"], ''CNN'', Feb. 14, 2012</ref><ref name=Furtwangler>[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 \"Chemical attraction: The science of kissing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090009/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 |date=2013-08-23 }}, ''Medill Reports'', Feb. 14, 2009</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nKristoffer Nyrop identified a number of types of kisses, including kisses of love, affection, peace, respect, and friendship. He notes, however, that the categories are somewhat contrived and overlapping, and some cultures have more kinds, including the French with twenty and the Germans with thirty.<ref name=Nyrop>Nyrop, Christoper. ''The Kiss and its History'', Sands & Co., London (1901) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UQgNAAAAYAAJ Read full text]</ref>\n\n=== Expression of affection ===\nKissing another person's lips has become a common expression of affection or warm greeting in many cultures worldwide. Yet in certain cultures, kissing was introduced only through European settlement, before which it was not a routine occurrence. Such cultures include certain indigenous peoples of Australia, the Tahitians, and many tribes in Africa.<ref name=Dyer>Dyer, Tristeleton T.F. \"The History of Kissing\", ''The American Magazine'', vol. 14 1882, pp. 611\u2013614</ref>\n\nA kiss can also be used to express feelings without an erotic element but can be nonetheless \"far deeper and more lasting\", writes Nyrop. He adds that such kisses can be expressive of love \"in the widest and most comprehensive meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|79}}\n\nNyrop writes that the most common example is the \"intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring\", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between other members of the same family, which can include those outside the immediate family circle, \"everywhere where deep affection unites people.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82}} The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Esau met Jacob after a long separation, he ran towards him, fell on his neck, and kissed him ({{bible verse|Genesis|33:4|HE}}), [[Moses]] greeted his father-in-law and kissed him ({{bible verse|Exodus|18:7|HE}}), and [[Orpah]] kissed her mother-in-law before leaving her ({{bible verse|Ruth|1:4|HE}}). The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], as when [[Odysseus]], on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|82\u201383}}\n\nAffection can be a cause of kissing \"in all ages in grave and solemn moments,\" notes Nyrop, \"not only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of profound gratitude. When the [[Apostle Paul]] took leave of the elders of the congregation at [[Ephesus]], \"they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him\" (Acts 20:37). Kisses can also be exchanged between total strangers, as when there is a profound sympathy with or the warmest interest in another person.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|85}}\n\n[[Folk poetry]] has been the source of affectionate kisses where they sometimes played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the \"redeeming power of the kiss are to be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her.\" In the reverse situation, in the tale of \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|95\u201396}}\n\nA kiss of affection can also take place after death. In {{bible verse|Genesis|50:1|HE}}, it is written that when Jacob was dead, \"Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him.\" And it is told of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Muhammad]]'s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when the prophet was dead, he went into the latter's tent, uncovered his face, and kissed him. Nyrop writes that \"the kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved, and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether world.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|97}}\n\nKissing on the lips can be a physical expression of affection or love between two people in which the sensations of touch, taste, and smell are involved.<ref name=Brayer /> According to the psychologist Menachem Brayer, although many \"mammals, birds, and insects exchange caresses\" which appear to be kisses of affection, they are not kisses in the human sense.\n\nSurveys indicate that kissing is the second most common form of [[physical intimacy]] among United States adolescents (after [[holding hands]]), and that about 85% of 15 to 16-year-old adolescents in the US have experienced it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00061-0 |pmid=10706169 |title=Smart teens don't have sex (or kiss much either) |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213\u201325 |year=2000 |last1=Halpern |first1=Carolyn Tucker |last2=Joyner |first2=Kara |last3=Udry |first3=J.Richard |last4=Suchindran |first4=Chirayath }}</ref>\n\n=== Kiss on the lips ===\nThe kiss on the lips can be performed between two [[friend]]s or family. This move aims to express affection for a friend. Unlike kissing for [[love]], a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The kiss on the lips is a practice that can be found in the time of [[Patriarchs (Bible)]].<ref>William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988</ref> In [[Ancient Greece]], the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank.<ref>Marine Gasc, racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[kiss of peace]] was recommended by the Catholic Church.<ref>Yannick Carr\u00e9, ''Le baiser sur la bouche au Moyen \u00c2ge : rites, symboles, mentalit\u00e9s, \u00e0 travers les textes et les images, XIe-XVe si\u00e8cles'', Le L\u00e9opard d'Or, 1992, page 357</ref> The kiss on the lips was also common among knights.<ref>Marine Gasc racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016</ref> The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.<ref>Eric Anderson, Adi Adams, Ian Rivers, Archives of Sexual Behavior [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47521172_I_Kiss_Them_Because_I_Love_Them_The_Emergence_of_Heterosexual_Men_Kissing_in_British_Institutes_of_Education \u201cI Kiss Them Because I Love Them\u201d: The Emergence of Heterosexual Men Kissing in British Institutes of Education], UK, April 2012, Volume 41. 2, pages 421\u2013430</ref><ref>Journal 7sur7.be, [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/1176526/2010/10/29/Nouvelle-tendance-des-bisous-sur-la-bouche-entre-amis.dhtml Nouvelle tendance: des bisous sur la bouche entre amis!], Belgium, October 29, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Romantic kiss ===\n[[File:Kuss.jpg|thumb|left|A romantic kiss]]\nIn many cultures, it is considered a harmless custom for [[teenagers]] to kiss on a [[dating|date]] or to engage in [[party games|kissing games]] with friends. These games serve as icebreakers at parties and may be some participants' first exposure to sexuality. There are many such games, including [[Truth or Dare?]], [[Seven Minutes in Heaven]] (or the variation \"Two Minutes in the Closet\"), [[spin the bottle|Spin the Bottle]], [[Post Office (game)|Post Office]], and Wink.\n\nThe psychologist William Cane notes that kissing in [[Western world|Western]] society is often a romantic act and describes a few of its attributes:\n{{quotation|It's not hard to tell when two people are in love. Maybe they're trying to hide it from the world, still they cannot conceal their inner excitement. Men will give themselves away by a certain excited trembling in the muscles of the lower jaw upon seeing their beloved. Women will often turn pale immediately of seeing their lover and then get slightly red in the face as their sweetheart draws near. This is the effect of physical closeness upon two people who are in love.<ref name=Cane>Cane, William. ''The Art of Kissing'', Macmillan (1991)</ref>{{Rp|9}}}}\n\n[[File:USS Oak Hill (LSD 51) First Kiss 111221-N-JP983-008.jpg|thumb|Two women belonging to the US Navy who are formally in a relationship kiss in public upon meeting after a long time, 2011.]]\nRomantic kissing in Western cultures is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature. In the Middle Ages it became a social gesture and was considered a sign of refinement of the upper classes.<ref name=Brayer>Brayer, Menachem M. ''The Jewish Woman in Rabbinic Literature'', KTAV Publishing House (1986)</ref>{{Rp|150\u2013151}} Other cultures have different definitions and uses of kissing, notes Brayer. In [[China]], for example, a similar expression of affection consists of rubbing one's nose against the cheek of another person. In other Eastern cultures kissing is not common. In South East Asian countries the \"sniff kiss\" is the most common form of affection and Western [[Human mouth|mouth]] to mouth kissing is often reserved for sexual foreplay. In some tribal cultures the \"equivalent for our 'kiss me' is 'smell me.'\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe kiss can be an important expression of love and [[eroticism|erotic]] emotions. In his book ''The Kiss and its History'', Kristoffer Nyrop describes the kiss of love as an \"exultant message of the longing of love, love eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the lovers' lips, and 'rises,' as Charles Fuster has said, 'up to the blue sky from the green plains,' like a tender, trembling thank-offering.\" Nyrop adds that the love kiss, \"rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all other earthly joys in sublimity.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|30}} He also compares it to achievements in life: \"Thus even the highest work of art, yet, the loftiest reputation, is nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|31}}\n\nThe power of a kiss is not minimized when he writes that \"we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss ...\" Kissing, he implies, can lead one to maturity: \"It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers,\" and can keep one feeling young: \"It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth.\" The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: \"In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss,\" and \"man craves for it as his noblest reward.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|37}}\n\nAs a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new. Nyrop gives a vivid example in the classic love story of [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. As a reward \"Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis\u2014an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock\":<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|47}}\n{{quotation|Ye gods, what are my feelings. Her lips are softer than the rose's leaf, her mouth is sweet as honey, and her kiss inflicts on me more pain than a bee's sting. I have often kissed my kids, I have often kissed my lambs, but never have I known aught like this. My pulse is beating fast, my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet, nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?}}\nRomantic kissing \"requires more than simple proximity,\" notes Cane. It also needs \"some degree of intimacy or privacy, ... which is why you'll see lovers stepping to the side of a busy street or sidewalk.\"<ref name=Cane /> Psychologist [[Wilhelm Reich]] \"lashed out at society\" for not giving young lovers enough privacy and making it difficult to be alone.<ref name=Cane /> However, Cane describes how many lovers manage to attain romantic privacy despite being in a public setting, as they \"lock their minds together\" and thereby create an invisible sense of \"psychological privacy.\" He adds, \"In this way they can kiss in public even in a crowded plaza and keep it romantic.\"<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}} Nonetheless, when Cane asked people to describe the most romantic places they ever kissed, \"their answers almost always referred to this ends-of-the-earth isolation, ... they mentioned an apple orchard, a beach, out in a field looking at the stars, or at a pond in a secluded area ...\"<ref name=Cane />{{Rp|10}}\n\n== Kiss as ritual ==\n[[File:Maestranza-1.jpg|thumb|Kiss on the crucifix in Catholicism]]\n[[File:Denis Thatcher Nancy Reagan 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Thatcher]], husband of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Hand-kissing|kissing the hand]] of [[Nancy Reagan]] wife of Former US President in 1988]]\n[[File:Kiss the Blarney Stone.jpg|thumb|Kissing the [[Blarney Stone]]]]\n\nThroughout history, a kiss has been a ritual, formal, symbolic or social gesture indicating devotion, respect or greeting. It appears as a ritual or symbol of religious devotion. For example, in the case of kissing a temple floor, or a religious book or icon. Besides devotion, a kiss has also indicated subordination or, nowadays, respect.\n\nIn modern times the practice continues, as in the case of a bride and groom kissing at the conclusion of a wedding ceremony or national leaders kissing each other in greeting, and in many other situations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nA kiss in a religious context is common. In earlier periods of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] kissing became a ritual gesture, and is still treated as such in certain customs, as when \"kissing... relics, or a bishop's ring.\"<ref name=Brayer /> In [[Judaism]], the kissing of the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]], a [[Siddur|prayer book]], and a [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] is also common.<ref>Kuraweil, Arthur.''The Torah for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing (2008) p. 218</ref> Crawley notes that it was \"very significant of the affectionate element in religion\" to give so important a part to the kiss as part of its ritual. In the early Church the baptized were kissed by the celebrant after the ceremony, and its use was even extended as a salute to saints and religious heroes, with Crawley adding, \"Thus Joseph kissed Jacob, and his disciples kissed Paul. Joseph kissed his dead father, and the custom was retained in our civilization\", as the farewell kiss on dead relatives, although certain sects prohibit this today.<ref name=Crawley>Crawley, Ernest. ''Studies of Savages and Sex'', Kessinger Publishing (revised and reprinted) (2006)</ref>{{Rp|126}}\n\nA distinctive element in the Christian [[liturgy]] was noted by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] in the 2nd century, now referred to as the \"[[kiss of peace]],\" and once part of the rite in the primitive Mass. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] has stated that this act originated within the ancient Hebrew [[synagogue]], and [[Philo]], the ancient Jewish philosopher called it a \"kiss of harmony\", where, as Crawley explains, \"the Word of God brings hostile things together in concord and the kiss of love.\"<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}} [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Saint Cyril]] also writes, \"this kiss is the sign that our souls are united, and that we banish all remembrance of injury.\"<ref name=Crawley />{{Rp|128}}\n\n=== Kiss of peace ===\nNyrop notes that the [[kiss of peace]] was used as an expression of deep, spiritual devotion in the [[early Christian Church]]. Christ said, for instance, \"Peace be with you, my peace I give you,\" and the members of Christ's Church gave each other peace symbolically through a kiss. [[St Paul]] repeatedly speaks of the \"holy kiss,\" and, in his [[Epistle]] to the Romans, writes: \"Salute one another with an holy kiss\" and his first Epistle to the Thessalonians ([[1 Thessalonians]] 5:26), he says: \"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|101}}\n\nThe kiss of peace was also used in [[secular]] festivities. During the [[Middle Ages]], for example, Nyrop points out that it was the custom to \"seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a kiss.\" Even knights gave each other the kiss of peace before proceeding to the combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs. The holy kiss was also found in the ritual of the Church on solemn occasions, such as baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or obsequies. However, toward the end of the Middle Ages the kiss of peace disappears as the official token of reconciliation.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|109}}\n\n=== Kiss of respect ===\n[[File:Re-enactment at the Seashore (5851205620) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man kissing the ground after a long sea voyage (as part of a reenactment of the first landing of English settlers in Virginia in 1607)]]\nThe kiss of respect is of ancient origin, notes Nyrop. He writes that \"from the remotest times we find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful\u2014to the gods, their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors; out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon were greeted with kisses.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|114}}\n\nHe notes some examples, as \"when the prophet [[Hosea]] laments over the idolatry of the children of [[Israel]], he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them\" ({{bible verse|Hosea|13:2|HE}}). In classical times similar homage was often paid to the gods, and people were known to kiss the hands, knees, feet, and the mouths, of their idols. [[Cicero]] writes that the lips and beard of the famous statue of [[Hercules]] at [[Agrigentum]] were worn away by the kisses of devotees.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|115}}\n\nPeople kissed the cross with the image of Jesus, and such kissing of the cross is always considered a holy act. In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that \"as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed.\" Kissing the cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and the pictures and statues of saints\u2014not only their pictures, \"but even their relics are kissed,\" notes Nyrop. \"They make both soul and body whole.\" There are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their health by kissing relics, he points out.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|121}}\n\nThe kiss of respect has also represented a mark of fealty, humility and reverence. Its use in ancient times was widespread, and Nyrop gives examples: \"people threw themselves down on the ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally 'licked the dust,' as it is termed.\"<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|124}} \"Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe the kiss of respect.

The friendly kiss until recent times usually occurred only between ladies, but today it is also common between men and women, especially if there is a great difference in age. According to Nyrop, up until the 20th century, \"it seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of royal personages,\" although he notes that in former times the \"friendly kiss was very common with us between man and man as well as between persons of opposite sexes.\" In guilds, for example, it was customary for the members to greet each other \"with hearty [[handshake]]s and smacking kisses,\" and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed both their hosts and hostesses.<ref name=Nyrop />{{Rp|142}}\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nIn approximately 10% of the world population, kissing does not take place, for a variety of reasons, including that they find it dirty or because of superstitious reasons. For example, in parts of [[Sudan]] it is believed that the mouth is the portal to the soul, so they do not want to invite death or have their spirit taken.<ref name=demirjian /> Psychology professor [[Elaine Hatfield]] noted that \"kissing was far from universal and even seen as improper by many societies.\"<ref name=India>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-india-kisses-are-on-rise-even-in-public.html?_r=0 \"In India, Kisses Are on Rise, Even in Public\"], ''New York Times'', Feb. 13, 2013</ref> Despite kissing being widespread, in some parts of the world it still is taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.\n\n=== As a theme in art===\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"225px\">\nFile:Romeo and Juliet (detail) by Frank Dicksee.png|''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' <br>by Sir [[Frank Bernard Dicksee|Frank Dicksee]]\nFile:Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard - The Stolen Kiss.jpg|[[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] <br>''[[The Stolen Kiss (Fragonard)|The Stolen Kiss]]'' (1786)\nFile:El Beso (Pinacoteca de Brera, Mil\u00e1n, 1859).jpg|''[[The Kiss (Hayez)|The Kiss]]'' <br>by [[Francesco Hayez]] (1859)\nFile:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - A Little Coaxing (1890).jpg|''A Little Coaxing''<br />by [[William Bouguereau]] (1890)\nFile:Amor und Psyche Ausschnitt Louvre.jpg|''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' <br>by [[Antonio Canova]]\nFile:The Kiss.JPG|''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|Le Baiser]]'' (\"The Kiss\") <br>by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1882)\n</gallery>\n\n=== South Asia ===\nOn-screen lip-kissing was not a regular occurrence in [[Bollywood]] until the 1990s, although it has been present from the time of the inception of Bollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/90948.html|title=Bollywood most passionate kisses of all times|publisher=}}</ref> This can appear contradictory since the culture of kissing is believed to have originated and spread from India.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/11/01/a-short-history-of-the-kiss-in-india/|title=A Short History of the Kiss in India|first=Atish|last=Patel|date=1 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== West Asia ===\nThere are also taboos as to whom one can kiss in some [[Muslim]]-majority societies governed by religious law.

When lips are pressed together for an extended period, usually accompanied with an [[hug|embrace]], it is an expression of romantic and sexual desire. The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their [[tongue]] into their mouth, is called [[French kiss]]ing. \"[[Making out]]\" is often an [[adolescent]]'s first experience of their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and games which involve kissing, such as [[Spin the Bottle]], facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.\n\nIn modern [[Eastern culture]], the etiquette vary depending on the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a baby on the cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.\n\n=== Kissing in films ===\nThe first romantic kiss on screen was in American silent films in 1896, beginning with the film ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]''. The kiss lasted 18 seconds and caused many to rail against decadence in the new medium of silent film. Writer [[Louis Black]] writes that \"it was the United States that brought kissing out of the Dark Ages.\"<ref name=Texas>''Texas Monthly'', Feb. 1980 p. 143</ref> However, it met with severe disapproval by defenders of public morality, especially in New York.

Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, traveling up her arm, and then kissing her on the back of her neck. Actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like [[Nazimova]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Vilma B\u00e1nky]] and [[Greta Garbo]], became screen idols as a result.\n\nEventually the film industry began to adopt the dictates of the [[Production Code]] established in 1934, overseen by [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] and supported by the church{{Which|date=June 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the new code, \"Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown.\"<ref name=Texas /> As a result, kissing scenes were shortened, with scenes cut away, leaving the imagination of the viewer to take over. Under the code, actors kissing had to keep their feet on the ground and had to be either standing or sitting.<ref name=Citron>Citron, Lana. ''A Compendium of Kisses'', Harlequin Publ.

Author [[Lana Citron]] writes that \"men were perceived as the kissers and women the receivers. Should the roles ever be reversed, women were regarded as vamps . . .\"<ref name=Citron /> According to Citron, [[Mae West]] and [[Anna May Wong]] were the only Hollywood actresses never to have been kissed on screen.<ref name=Citron /> Among the films rated for having the most romantic kisses are ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.<ref name=Citron />\n\nSociologist Eva Illouz notes that surveys taken in 1935 showed that \"love was the most important theme represented in movies.

''Consuming the Romantic Utopia'', Univ. of Calif. Press (1997) p. 31</ref>\n\nIn early Japanese films, kissing and sexual expression were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), but when the film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested \"we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?\" Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were \"sneaky\", claiming that \"if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too.\"<ref>Kyoko Hirano, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: The Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945\u20131952'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1992), pp 154\u201357, 162</ref>\n\n=== Non-sexual kisses ===\n[[File:Fanciful_sketch_by_Marguerite_Martyn_of_a_New_Years_Eve_celebration.jpg|thumb|right|People kissing in this sketch by reporter and artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of a [[New Year's Eve]] celebration in 1914]]\nIn some Western cultures it is considered [[luck|good luck]] to kiss someone on [[Christmas]] or on [[New Year's Eve]], especially beneath a sprig of [[mistletoe]].

A kiss can be \"blown\" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term ''flying kiss'' is used in India to describe a blown kiss.

The division was named after the [[Wannon River]]. For the first half-century after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], it regularly traded hands between the [[Australian Labor Party]] and the conservative parties. However, a 1955 redistribution removed most of the seat's Labor-friendly territory, and it has been a safe [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] seat for most of its history since then.\n\nThe seat's most notable member was [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]], to date the last prime minister from a country seat.  His successor, [[David Hawker]], was [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives]] during the last term of the [[John Howard|Howard]] Government.  Hawker retired in 2010 and was succeeded by [[Dan Tehan]].\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe division is located in the south-west of the state, and encompasses most of the [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District]] of the state. It adjoins the [[South Australia]]n border in the west, and the [[Bass Strait]] coast in the south. The division encompasses the towns of [[Warrnambool]], [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]], [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]] and [[Halls Gap]]. The [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]] and the [[Port Campbell National Park]]s are in the division. [[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]] and [[Avoca, Victoria|Avoca]] became part of Wannon at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] due to a redistribution that took place on 24 December 2010.\n\n==Members==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!
