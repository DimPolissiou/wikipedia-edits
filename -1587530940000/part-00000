His mother Indera was a housewife, and his father Andrew Sivam was a store supervisor. His ancestors hailed from [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]] and also [[Coimbatore]], [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. He is the eldest of two siblings in a family consisting a sister (Patricia Sivagamy).\n\nSHESHA had his primary education at the '''Sekolah Kebangsaan Tunku Abdul Malik''' in Kulim. As a child he had a great interest in badminton and chess. After his primary, SHESHA was enrolled at the '''Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Kulim'''. Upon completion of his school education, SHESHA performed several jobs like telemarketer, waiting staff, bartender and disc jockey while pursuing his studies in engineering in Penang. Quitting his studies in Penang, SHESHA left to Kuala Lumpur to pursue his music career. Performing several jobs like manual labour and customer service representative. Later on decided to take up sound & music course in [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]]. His relative and friends motivated him to join the university and supported him during this phase. SHESHA graduated with a full scholarship aid given by Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Sri Paduka Dr Limkokwing.\n\n==Career==\n===2005\u20132008===\nSHESHA under the moniker Fadeproof together with his comrades, Avathara and MC Hesh formed a band called '''Pistah Few''', influenced by the Malaysian Hip hop Group, [[Poetic Ammo]]. For two years, they ventured out as a band and serenaded local events like prom nights and cultural shows. This provided them with the opportunity to further sharpen their showmanship, emceeing skills and songwriting. Their first break rose when [[Gang Starz]], a reality television show of [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] Malaysia held its audition at Sheraton Hotel, Penang in 2007. Pistah Few was judged by Cat Farish, a popular actor, singer and record producer and also Juliza Adzlizan, a popular actor, singer and vocal teacher. Pistah Few\u2019s performance of self-written and composed song '''Flamethrowah''' truly awed the judges, thus enabling them to represent the northern region for the national level audition in [[Istana Budaya]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\nThough they failed to proceed further, competing among groups from South East Asia provided the trio with the much needed exposure and experience to further hone musical skills and learn what\u2019s required to succeed professionally.Meeting DJ Chaoz at Gang Starz audition further led them to be introduced to the Penang Urban music scene and to perform gigs around Penang. They had the golden chances of performing at Urban Volume 2 by DJ Laze, Urban Showdown by Muneer of Urban Method along artistes like Altimet, Northsyde, Royal Maximus and many more.Soon, Pistah Few became a duo. Avathara and SHESHA continued. In 2008, Pistah Few won the competition held by ECHO PARK Penang. Hip Hop RnB Extravaganza was judged by Simon Michael (One in A Million - season 3 - finalist). In the same year, they performed for a notable charity event called 30 Hour Famine 2008 by [[World Vision International|World Vision]] Malaysia in KL.
