It is a member municipality of [[Metro Vancouver]] and the location of the [[Vancouver International Airport]]. During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] was a venue for the [[long track speed skating]] events.\n\nAs of 2016, the city has an estimated population of 198,309 people with 60% being [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants]]<nowiki/>, the highest proportion of immigrants in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/demographics.htm |title=City of Richmond BC \u2013 History and Demographics |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\nRichmond is located on [[Lulu Island]] at the [[River mouth|mouth]] of the [[Fraser River]]. It encompasses adjacent [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]] and some smaller uninhabited [[islets]] to the north and south. Neighbouring communities are [[Vancouver]] and [[Burnaby]] to the north, [[New Westminster]] to the east, and [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]] to the south. The [[Strait of Georgia]] forms its western border.\n\n==History==\n[[Coast Salish]] bands had temporary camps on the island, to fish and collect berries, which were scattered and moved from year to year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/history.htm |title=City of Richmond BC \u2013 History |publisher=Richmond.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref>  Certain Coast Salish summer camps were located at Garry Point, and Woodward's Landing, along with the site of the Terra Nova cannery, which had at one time been a Musqueam village.<ref>Wayne Suttles, \u201cNames of Places and Peoples\u201d from Musqueam Reference Grammar (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2004), 566\u201376.</ref>\n\nThere is no definitive historical account as to how Richmond was named. There are several possibilities that have been proposed, including:\n* The first family to settle in Richmond, that of Hugh McRoberts, had formerly lived in Australia. Their home there was called \u201cRichmond View\u201d and that is what they named their homestead in Richmond.\n* W.D. Ferris drafted the original petition for the incorporation of The Township of Richmond. He was originally from [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey, England]].\n* Another early settler was Hugh Boyd. He was also the first Reeve of the township. His wife had been born in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond, Yorkshire, England]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=Mary |title=A bridge to the world : the life and times of Sea Island |publisher=City of Richmond Archives |isbn=0-9690031-5-3 |url=https://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/abridgetotheworld38325.pdf |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Township of Richmond, British Columbia incorporated on November 10, 1879. The Township of Richmond was modeled after Ontario's political townships \u2013 an incorporated municipality, consisting of communities that are united as a single entity with a single municipal administration. Each community was represented on the municipal council through a ward electoral system with five wards until 1946 when the ward electoral system was replaced with the at large electoral system that is currently in place.\n\nOn December 3, 1990, Richmond was designated as a City.\n\nThe first Town Hall, the Agricultural Hall and the Methodist Church (now Minoru Chapel), were built at the corner of No. 17 (River) Rd and No. 20 (Cambie) Rd near the main settlement on the northwestern tip of Lulu Island at North Arm.\n\nThe old fishing village of [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] on the southwestern tip of [[Lulu Island]] is now home to several museums and heritage sites, as well as a working harbour for fishing boats. Currently, London Heritage Farm, the [[Gulf of Georgia Cannery]] and the Britannia Shipyard National Historic Site in Steveston highlight these parts of Richmond's diverse history.\n\n==Geography==\nRichmond is made up of most of the islands in the [[Fraser River]] delta, the largest and most populated island being [[Lulu Island]]. The city of Richmond includes all but a small portion of Lulu Island (the Queensborough neighbourhood at the far eastern tip is part of the city of New Westminster). The next largest island, [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]], is home to the [[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR). In addition to Lulu and Sea Islands, 15 smaller islands make up the city's {{convert|129.66|km2|sqmi}} land area, including:\n* [[Mitchell Island]], an industrial island accessed via the Knight Street Bridge, a bridge which connects Richmond and Vancouver.\n* Richmond Island, a former sand bar that is has been turned into a peninsula that can only be reached from Vancouver, but technically is within Richmond's city limits. \n* Shady Island, an uninhabited island covered with trees, which can be reached over land by foot at low tide from near Steveston.\n\nThe city also includes the fishing village of Steveston, located in the far southwest corner of the city, and [[Burkeville, British Columbia|Burkeville]], which shares Sea Island with the airport. Both Steveston and Burkeville were independent villages until they were annexed by Richmond.\n\nSince all of Richmond occupies islands in a [[river delta]], the city has plenty of rich, [[alluvial soil]] for agriculture, and was one of the first areas in British Columbia to be farmed by Europeans in the 19th century. The drawback of Richmond's geographical location was that since all the land averages just one metre above [[sea level]], it was prone to flooding, especially during [[high tide]]. As a result, all the major islands are now surrounded by a system of [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], which, although not as massive as those in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[levee]]s of [[New Orleans]], serve to protect the town from anticipated sources of flooding. There is a possibility that, during an [[earthquake]], the dykes could rupture and the alluvial soil may [[soil liquefaction|liquefy]], causing extensive damage. Richmond is also at risk of a major flood if the [[Fraser River]] has an unusually high spring [[freshet]]. Recreational trails run along the tops of many of the dykes, and Richmond also supports about {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} of parkland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/profile.htm |title=City of Richmond Profile |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the high [[groundwater]] table, very few houses in Richmond have [[basement]]s and until the late 1980s, very few buildings were above 3 storeys high. Also, because of proximity to the airport, current [[building code]]s limit the height of buildings to {{convert|150|ft|m}}.\n\n===Climate===\nRichmond enjoys a temperate climate. Because it is not as close to the mountains, it actually receives 30% less rain than neighbouring Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welcomebc.ca/wbc/immigration/regions/vancouver/cities/vancouver.page?#richmond |title=Vancouver: Richmond |publisher=welcomebc.ca}}</ref> It rarely snows in winter and the summer temperatures are mild to warm. Richmond is also very prone to fog in the cooler months.\n\n{{weather box \n|single line = yes \n|metric first = yes \n|location = Richmond Nature Park (1981\u20132010 Normals)\n|Jan record high C =

A [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rail line called the [[Canada Line]], connecting both Richmond Centre and the airport to Downtown Vancouver and to points in between, opened on Monday, 17 August 2009. The Canada Line provides travel to Downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes with a frequency of 3 to 12 minutes, 20 hours per day. Major transit hubs are the [[Richmond\u2013Brighouse Station]], which is the hub for almost all Richmond bus routes, and the [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport Station]] which is the hub for all bus routes from outlying suburbs. After the Canada Line closes at night, 24/7 service is provided by the [[List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver#NightBus|N10 Nightbus]] every day of the week.

It is a member municipality of [[Metro Vancouver]] and the location of the [[Vancouver International Airport]]. During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] was a venue for the [[long track speed skating]] events.\n\nAs of 2016, the city has an estimated population of 198,309 people with 60% being [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants]]<nowiki/>, the highest proportion of immigrants in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/demographics.htm |title=City of Richmond BC \u2013 History and Demographics |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\nRichmond is located on [[Lulu Island]] at the [[River mouth|mouth]] of the [[Fraser River]]. It encompasses adjacent [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]] and some smaller uninhabited [[islets]] to the north and south. Neighbouring communities are [[Vancouver]] and [[Burnaby]] to the north, [[New Westminster]] to the east, and [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]] to the south. The [[Strait of Georgia]] forms its western border.\n\n==History==\n[[Coast Salish]] bands had temporary camps on the island, to fish and collect berries, which were scattered and moved from year to year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/history.htm |title=City of Richmond BC \u2013 History |publisher=Richmond.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref>  Certain Coast Salish summer camps were located at Garry Point, and Woodward's Landing, along with the site of the Terra Nova cannery, which had at one time been a Musqueam village.<ref>Wayne Suttles, \u201cNames of Places and Peoples\u201d from Musqueam Reference Grammar (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2004), 566\u201376.</ref>\n\nThere is no definitive historical account as to how Richmond was named. There are several possibilities that have been proposed, including:\n* The first family to settle in Richmond, that of Hugh McRoberts, had formerly lived in Australia. Their home there was called \u201cRichmond View\u201d and that is what they named their homestead in Richmond.\n* W.D. Ferris drafted the original petition for the incorporation of The Township of Richmond. He was originally from [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey, England]].\n* Another early settler was Hugh Boyd. He was also the first Reeve of the township. His wife had been born in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond, Yorkshire, England]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=Mary |title=A bridge to the world : the life and times of Sea Island |publisher=City of Richmond Archives |isbn=0-9690031-5-3 |url=https://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/abridgetotheworld38325.pdf |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Township of Richmond, British Columbia incorporated on November 10, 1879. The Township of Richmond was modeled after Ontario's political townships \u2013 an incorporated municipality, consisting of communities that are united as a single entity with a single municipal administration. Each community was represented on the municipal council through a ward electoral system with five wards until 1946 when the ward electoral system was replaced with the at large electoral system that is currently in place.\n\nOn December 3, 1990, Richmond was designated as a City.\n\nThe first Town Hall, the Agricultural Hall and the Methodist Church (now Minoru Chapel), were built at the corner of No. 17 (River) Rd and No. 20 (Cambie) Rd near the main settlement on the northwestern tip of Lulu Island at North Arm.\n\nThe old fishing village of [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] on the southwestern tip of [[Lulu Island]] is now home to several museums and heritage sites, as well as a working harbour for fishing boats. Currently, London Heritage Farm, the [[Gulf of Georgia Cannery]] and the Britannia Shipyard National Historic Site in Steveston highlight these parts of Richmond's diverse history.\n\n==Geography==\nRichmond is made up of most of the islands in the [[Fraser River]] delta, the largest and most populated island being [[Lulu Island]]. The city of Richmond includes all but a small portion of Lulu Island (the Queensborough neighbourhood at the far eastern tip is part of the city of New Westminster). The next largest island, [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]], is home to the [[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR). In addition to Lulu and Sea Islands, 15 smaller islands make up the city's {{convert|129.66|km2|sqmi}} land area, including:\n* [[Mitchell Island]], an industrial island accessed via the Knight Street Bridge, a bridge which connects Richmond and Vancouver.\n* Richmond Island, a former sand bar that is has been turned into a peninsula that can only be reached from Vancouver, but technically is within Richmond's city limits. \n* Shady Island, an uninhabited island covered with trees, which can be reached over land by foot at low tide from near Steveston.\n\nThe city also includes the fishing village of Steveston, located in the far southwest corner of the city, and [[Burkeville, British Columbia|Burkeville]], which shares Sea Island with the airport. Both Steveston and Burkeville were independent villages until they were annexed by Richmond.\n\nSince all of Richmond occupies islands in a [[river delta]], the city has plenty of rich, [[alluvial soil]] for agriculture, and was one of the first areas in British Columbia to be farmed by Europeans in the 19th century. The drawback of Richmond's geographical location was that since all the land averages just one metre above [[sea level]], it was prone to flooding, especially during [[high tide]]. As a result, all the major islands are now surrounded by a system of [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], which, although not as massive as those in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[levee]]s of [[New Orleans]], serve to protect the town from anticipated sources of flooding. There is a possibility that, during an [[earthquake]], the dykes could rupture and the alluvial soil may [[soil liquefaction|liquefy]], causing extensive damage. Richmond is also at risk of a major flood if the [[Fraser River]] has an unusually high spring [[freshet]]. Recreational trails run along the tops of many of the dykes, and Richmond also supports about {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} of parkland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/profile.htm |title=City of Richmond Profile |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the high [[groundwater]] table, very few houses in Richmond have [[basement]]s and until the late 1980s, very few buildings were above 3 storeys high. Also, because of proximity to the airport, current [[building code]]s limit the height of buildings to {{convert|150|ft|m}}.\n\n===Climate===\nRichmond enjoys a temperate climate. Because it is not as close to the mountains, it actually receives 30% less rain than neighbouring Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welcomebc.ca/wbc/immigration/regions/vancouver/cities/vancouver.page?#richmond |title=Vancouver: Richmond |publisher=welcomebc.ca}}</ref> It rarely snows in winter and the summer temperatures are mild to warm. Richmond is also very prone to fog in the cooler months.\n\n{{weather box \n|single line = yes \n|metric first = yes \n|location = Richmond Nature Park (1981\u20132010 Normals)\n|Jan record high C =

Three bridges (one of them twinned) connect Lulu Island to Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport; one bridge connects Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport to Vancouver; two bridges connect Lulu Island to Vancouver; one bridge connects Queensborough (on eastern Lulu Island) to New Westminster; one bridge connects Queensborough to Annacis Island in Delta; one twinned bridge connects Richmond to Annacis Island; and one of the few [[George Massey Tunnel|underwater tunnels]] in British Columbia connects Richmond to Delta.\n\n[[File:Dinsmore Bridge aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dinsmore Bridge]] (foreground) is one of three road connections between [[Lulu Island]] (at right) and [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]] (at left).]]\nRichmond is served by two freeways: [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]], which connects to [[Interstate 5]] at the border with the United States, and [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]], which connects Delta, New Westminster, and Richmond.\n\nRailway bridges connect Lulu Island to Vancouver, New Westminster, and [[Annacis Island]], and serve the [[Canadian National]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]s, as well as the Southern Railway of British Columbia (although the latter railway's Lulu Island trackage is entirely within Queensborough).\n\nThe public transit system in Metro Vancouver, planned and funded by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], currently has bus and rail connections from Richmond to [[Downtown Vancouver]], Surrey, New Westminster, Burnaby, Delta and the [[University of British Columbia]]. A [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rail line called the [[Canada Line]], connecting both Richmond Centre and the airport to Downtown Vancouver and to points in between, opened on Monday, 17 August 2009. The Canada Line provides travel to Downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes with a frequency of 3 to 12 minutes, 20 hours per day. Major transit hubs are the [[Richmond\u2013Brighouse Station]], which is the hub for almost all Richmond bus routes, and the [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport Station]] which is the hub for all bus routes from outlying suburbs. After the Canada Line closes at night, 24/7 service is provided by the [[List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver#NightBus|N10 Nightbus]] every day of the week. The bus runs every 30 minutes with one exception of a north bound trip (2{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}3{{nbsp}}am) when services is at 60 minutes; service returns to 30 minutes after the northbound trip at 3{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn September 2018, U-bicycle will launch a dockless [[bicycle sharing system]] in the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/1110381/dockless-bike-sharing-coming-port-moody-port-coquitlam-and-richmond-summer|title=Dockless bike-sharing coming to Port Moody, Port Coquitlam, and Richmond this summer|last=Lau|first=Lucy|date=31 July 2018|work=[[The Georgia Straight]]|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR), located on Sea Island, which is part of Richmond, to the north of Lulu Island, provides most of the air access to the region. Several [[float plane]] companies (including [[Salt Spring Air]], [[Harbour Air]] and [[Seair Seaplanes]]) operate from the south terminal, providing service to the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island. The airport is the second busiest in Canada and one of the busiest international airports on the West Coast of North America.\n\n===Health care===\nHealth care in Richmond is overseen by the [[Vancouver Coastal Health Authority]], which also covers the City of [[Vancouver]], District of [[West Vancouver]], [[North Vancouver (city)|City of North Vancouver]], and [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]] as well as coastal regions of [[British Columbia]]. \nThe only hospital in Richmond is [[Richmond Hospital]], located on the southeast corner of Westminster Highway and Gilbert Road.\nThe city is known internationally as the headquarters of the [[Canadian Hemochromatosis Society]], and also as the city where the National Annual Hemochromatosis Awareness Month was initiated by former Mayor G. H. Blair in 1987.\n\n===Emergency services===\n[[File:Rfd-truck1.jpg|thumb|right|Richmond Fire-Rescue]]\nThe [[Richmond Fire Rescue Department]], established in 1897, is responsible for providing both fire and extrication services in Richmond.

The minimum definition describes what [[Michael Freeden]] has called the \"core concept\"{{Efn|Freeden has developed in 1996 the idea that every ideology has \"core\" and \"peripheral\" concepts. Building on his work, Terance Ball (1999) has given the following definition: \"A core concept is one that is both central to, and constitutive of, a particular ideology and therefore of the ideological community to which it gives inspiration and identity. For example, the concept of 'class' (and of course 'class struggle') is a key or core concept in Marxism, as 'gender' is in feminism, and 'liberty' (or 'individual liberty') is in liberalism, and so on through the list of leading ideologies.\"|name=|group=}} of the right-wing populist ideology, that is the concept shared by all parties generally included in the family. Looking at the primary literature, Mudde concludes that the core concept of right-populism \"is undoubtedly the \"[[nation]]\". \"This concept\", he explains, \"also certainly functions as a \"coat-hanger\" for most other ideological features. Consequently, the minimum definition of the party family should be based on the key concept, the nation\". He however rejects the use of \"[[nationalism]]\" as a \"core ideology\" of right-wing populism on the ground that there are also purely \"civic\" or \"liberal\" forms of nationalism, preferring instead the term \"[[nativism (politics)|nativism]]\": a xenophobic form of nationalism asserting that \"states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (\"the nation\"), and that non-native elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state\". Mudde further argues that \"while nativism could include racist arguments, it can also be non-racist (including and excluding on the basis of culture or even religion)\", and that the term nativism does not reduce the parties to mere single-issue parties, such as the term \"anti-immigrant\" does. In the maximum definition, to nativism is added [[authoritarianism]]\u2014an attitude, not necessary anti-democratic or automatic, to prefer \"[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" and the submission to authority{{Efn|[[Cas Mudde|Mudde]]: authoritarianism \"is the belief in a strictly ordered society, in which infringements of authority are to be punished severely.

Right-wing populism has been fostered by RSS which stands against persecution of Hindus by various [[History of India|invading forces over the centuries]] and have also been attributed to the concept of  [[Hindutva]]. It vows to protect the ancient religion and culture of [[Hinduism]] and have strong views against destruction of its ancient heritage, in India.  BJP became a significant force in the state legislative assemblies and in the parliament in the 1990s by raising the issue of  Ram Mandir (temple) establishment  by demolishing the existing Babri Masjid (allegedly constructed by demolishing a Hindu temple) in [[Ayodhya]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. BJP and other conservative right wing organization such as [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]], [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] etc. argues that the Masjid was built by [[Babur]], the first Mughal emperor in India in 1526, by demolishing a Ram temple. This issue is known as the [[Ayodhya dispute|Ayodhya Dispute]] for which the final judgement was declared by the Supreme Court of India on 9 November 2019. The Supreme Court of India ordered the disputed land (2.77 acres) to be handed over to a trust (to be created by Government of India) to build the Ram Janmabhoomi (revered as the birthplace of Hindu deity, Ram) temple. The court also ordered the government to give an alternate 5 acres (almost double that of the Ram Janmabhumi) of land in another place to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.\n\nIn recently concluded [[2019 Indian general election]], the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP have swept across the elections with unprecedented majority of 353 seats by gaining popularity across India and reducing the United Progressive Alliance led by Indian National Congress to only 91 seats.\n\n==== Japan ====\nPrime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] and former Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] are both right-wing nationalists and populists.\n\nIn a speech to [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] lawmakers in Tokyo on March 8, 2019, [[Steve Bannon]] said that \u201cPrime Minister Abe is a great hero to the grassroots, the populist, and the nationalist movement throughout the world.\u201d<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/08/national/politics-diplomacy/ex-adviser-steve-bannon-confident-donald-trump-win-2020-despite-probes/#.XILevy2ZPOR], Ex-adviser Steve Bannon says Abe was 'Trump before Trump,' urges him to play hardball with China, Japan Times, 8 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==== Pakistan ====\nThe recent wave of right-wing populism is in Pakistan in the form of [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf]] (PTI).<ref name=\"Daily Times\">{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/284544/populism-visits-pakistan/|title=Populism visits Pakistan - Daily Times|date=17 August 2018|work=Daily Times|access-date=29 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Its leader [[Imran Khan]] has furiously attacked traditional politicians and made people believe that only he has the solutions.<ref name=\"Daily Times\"/> British journalist Ben Judah, in an interview, compared Imran Khan with Donald Trump on his populist rhetoric.<ref name=\"The limits of populism\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/282706-the-limits-of-populism|title=The limits of populism|access-date=29 October 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== South Korea ====\n[[File:Shinz\u014d Abe and Hong Jun-pyo at the Japanese Prime Minister's Office (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Hong Jun-pyo]], former leader of [[Liberty Korea Party|LKP]]]]\n[[Conservatism in South Korea]] has traditionally been more inclined toward [[elitism]] than [[populism]].

The same pattern emerged in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], in which those that saw the price of their house rise, voted to Remain. Whereas those that saw it flatline or drop, voted to Leave.\n\n====Austria====\nThe Austrian [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6) established in 1955 by a former [[Nazi]] functionary claims to represent a \"Third Camp\" (''Drittes Lager''), beside the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist Party]] and the social Catholic [[Austrian People's Party]]. It succeeded the [[Federation of Independents]] founded after World War II, adopting the pre-war heritage of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]]. Though it did not gain much popularity for decades, it exercised considerable [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] by supporting several [[Austrian Federal Government|federal governments]], be it right-wing or left-wing, e.g. the Socialist [[Bruno Kreisky|Kreisky]] cabinet of 1970 (see [[Kreisky\u2013Peter\u2013Wiesenthal affair]]).\n\n[[File:GuentherZ 2012-07-03 0158 Wien01 Parlament Hans-Christian Strache.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Heinz-Christian Strache]], former leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]]]]\nFrom 1980, the Freedom Party adopted a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance. Upon the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 federal election]], it entered a [[coalition government]] with the Socialist Party, whereby party chairman [[Norbert Steger]] served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice-Chancellor]]. The liberal interlude however ended, when [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] was elected chairman in 1986. By his down-to-earth manners and [[patriotism|patriotic]] attitude, Haider re-integrated the party's nationalist base voters. Nevertheless, he was also able to obtain votes from large sections of population disenchanted with politics by publicly denouncing corruption and [[nepotism]] of the Austrian ''[[Proporz]]'' system. The electoral success was boosted by Austria's [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] in 1995.\n\nUpon the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 federal election]], the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) with 26.9% of the votes cast became the second strongest party in the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament. Having entered a coalition government with the People's Party, Haider had to face the disability of several FP\u00d6 ministers, but also the impossibility of agitation against members of his own cabinet. In 2005, he finally countered the FP\u00d6's loss of reputation by the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) relaunch in order to carry on his government. The remaining FP\u00d6 members elected [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] chairman, but since the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 federal election]] both right-wing parties have run separately. After Haider was killed in a car accident in 2008, the BZ\u00d6 has lost a measurable amount of support.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 regained much of its support in subsequent elections. Its candidate [[Norbert Hofer]] made it into the runoff in the [[2016 Austrian presidential election|2016 presidential election]], though he narrowly lost the election. After the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 legislative elections]], the FP\u00d6 formed a [[First Kurz government|government coalition]] with the [[Austrian People's Party]], but lost seats in [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019]].\n\n====Belgium====\n[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag used by the now-defunct [[Vlaams Blok]]]]\n[[Vlaams Blok]], established in 1978, operated on a platform of law and order, anti-immigration (with particular focus on Islamic immigration) and secession of the [[Flanders]] region of the country.

Unlike traditional parties, they also do not belong to international organizations of like-minded parties, and they do not use similar terms to describe themselves.{{sfn|Norris|2005|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n[[Cas Mudde]] argues that two definitions can be given of the \"populist radical right\": a maximum and a minimum one, with the \"maximum\" group being a subgroup of the \"minimum\" group. The minimum definition describes what [[Michael Freeden]] has called the \"core concept\"{{Efn|Freeden has developed in 1996 the idea that every ideology has \"core\" and \"peripheral\" concepts. Building on his work, Terance Ball (1999) has given the following definition: \"A core concept is one that is both central to, and constitutive of, a particular ideology and therefore of the ideological community to which it gives inspiration and identity. For example, the concept of 'class' (and of course 'class struggle') is a key or core concept in Marxism, as 'gender' is in feminism, and 'liberty' (or 'individual liberty') is in liberalism, and so on through the list of leading ideologies.\"|name=|group=}} of the right-wing populist ideology, that is the concept shared by all parties generally included in the family. Looking at the primary literature, Mudde concludes that the core concept of right-populism \"is undoubtedly the \"[[nation]]\". \"This concept\", he explains, \"also certainly functions as a \"coat-hanger\" for most other ideological features. Consequently, the minimum definition of the party family should be based on the key concept, the nation\". He however rejects the use of \"[[nationalism]]\" as a \"core ideology\" of right-wing populism on the ground that there are also purely \"civic\" or \"liberal\" forms of nationalism, preferring instead the term \"[[nativism (politics)|nativism]]\": a xenophobic form of nationalism asserting that \"states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (\"the nation\"), and that non-native elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state\". Mudde further argues that \"while nativism could include racist arguments, it can also be non-racist (including and excluding on the basis of culture or even religion)\", and that the term nativism does not reduce the parties to mere single-issue parties, such as the term \"anti-immigrant\" does. In the maximum definition, to nativism is added [[authoritarianism]]\u2014an attitude, not necessary anti-democratic or automatic, to prefer \"[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" and the submission to authority{{Efn|[[Cas Mudde|Mudde]]: authoritarianism \"is the belief in a strictly ordered society, in which infringements of authority are to be punished severely. In this interpretation, [it] includes law and order and \u201cpunitive conventional moralism.\u201d It does not necessarily mean an anti-democratic attitude, but neither does it preclude one. In addition, the authoritarian\u2019s submission to authority, established or not, is \u201cnot absolute, automatic, nor blind\u201d.

Right-wing populism has been fostered by RSS which stands against persecution of Hindus by various [[History of India|invading forces over the centuries]] and have also been attributed to the concept of  [[Hindutva]]. It vows to protect the ancient religion and culture of [[Hinduism]] and have strong views against destruction of its ancient heritage, in India.  BJP became a significant force in the state legislative assemblies and in the parliament in the 1990s by raising the issue of  Ram Mandir (temple) establishment  by demolishing the existing Babri Masjid (allegedly constructed by demolishing a Hindu temple) in [[Ayodhya]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. BJP and other conservative right wing organization such as [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]], [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] etc. argues that the Masjid was built by [[Babur]], the first Mughal emperor in India in 1526, by demolishing a Ram temple. This issue is known as the [[Ayodhya dispute|Ayodhya Dispute]] for which the final judgement was declared by the Supreme Court of India on 9 November 2019.

The same pattern emerged in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], in which those that saw the price of their house rise, voted to Remain.

It succeeded the [[Federation of Independents]] founded after World War II, adopting the pre-war heritage of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]]. Though it did not gain much popularity for decades, it exercised considerable [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] by supporting several [[Austrian Federal Government|federal governments]], be it right-wing or left-wing, e.g. the Socialist [[Bruno Kreisky|Kreisky]] cabinet of 1970 (see [[Kreisky\u2013Peter\u2013Wiesenthal affair]]).\n\n[[File:GuentherZ 2012-07-03 0158 Wien01 Parlament Hans-Christian Strache.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Heinz-Christian Strache]], former leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]]]]\nFrom 1980, the Freedom Party adopted a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance. Upon the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 federal election]], it entered a [[coalition government]] with the Socialist Party, whereby party chairman [[Norbert Steger]] served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice-Chancellor]]. The liberal interlude however ended, when [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] was elected chairman in 1986. By his down-to-earth manners and [[patriotism|patriotic]] attitude, Haider re-integrated the party's nationalist base voters. Nevertheless, he was also able to obtain votes from large sections of population disenchanted with politics by publicly denouncing corruption and [[nepotism]] of the Austrian ''[[Proporz]]'' system. The electoral success was boosted by Austria's [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] in 1995.\n\nUpon the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 federal election]], the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) with 26.9% of the votes cast became the second strongest party in the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament. Having entered a coalition government with the People's Party, Haider had to face the disability of several FP\u00d6 ministers, but also the impossibility of agitation against members of his own cabinet. In 2005, he finally countered the FP\u00d6's loss of reputation by the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) relaunch in order to carry on his government. The remaining FP\u00d6 members elected [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] chairman, but since the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 federal election]] both right-wing parties have run separately. After Haider was killed in a car accident in 2008, the BZ\u00d6 has lost a measurable amount of support.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 regained much of its support in subsequent elections. Its candidate [[Norbert Hofer]] made it into the runoff in the [[2016 Austrian presidential election|2016 presidential election]], though he narrowly lost the election. After the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 legislative elections]], the FP\u00d6 formed a [[First Kurz government|government coalition]] with the [[Austrian People's Party]], but lost seats in [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019]].\n\n====Belgium====\n[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag used by the now-defunct [[Vlaams Blok]]]]\n[[Vlaams Blok]], established in 1978, operated on a platform of law and order, anti-immigration (with particular focus on Islamic immigration) and secession of the [[Flanders]] region of the country.

He started listening to [[Gnawa music]] since his young age, influenced by his father. After finishing his studies, he moved by the 1990's to [[Paris]] where he co-founded the National Orchestra of Barb\u00e8s (in [[French language|French]]: ''l'Orchestre National de Barb\u00e8s'' - ONB)<ref>[https://www.afro.video/en/artist/aziz-sahmaoui/ Aziz Sahmaoui - Afro Video]</ref>, which mixed [[Reggae]] and [[Ra\u00ef]] with North African incluences<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/aziz-sahmaoui-university-of-gnawa-review Aziz Sahmaoui and University of Gnawa \u2013 review - The Guardian (2011).]</ref>.\n\nAfter releasing two albums with ONB, he joined the pianist [[Joe Zawinul]] and collaborated with him in a number of songs<ref>[https://www.azizsahmaoui.com/ Biography of Aziz Sahmaoui]</ref>. In [[2010]], Sahmaoui founded his own band, The University of Gnawa, having members from various countries including [[France]], [[Senegal]] and North Africa. Inspired by its founder's experience, the band shows traces of many genres: North African Paris, ethno-Jazz Fusion, [[Ra\u00ef]], [[Chaabi]] and [[Music of West Africa|traditional West African music]]. Its core curriculum remains though: The deep exploration of Gnawa trance music<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/8331ccfc-ed5c-11e0-be97-00144feab49a University of Gnawa: University of Gnawa ft.

His emphasis on the social nature of Europe is been central to a important exceptionalism narrative that became central to the self identification of the European Union. <ref>Alessandra Bitumi, \"\u2018An uplifting tale of Europe\u2019.

A germanium diode in the AGC circuit had been replaced by a silicon diode, following an instruction by RN stores that all germanium diodes had to be replaced by silicon diodes.

The E variant was not long in service due to problems with its programming. This led to several of the [[frigate]]s that were intended to have used them ([[Rothesay-class frigate|''Rothesay'']] and [[Whitby-class frigate|''Whitby'']] classes) never being fitted with torpedo tubes or having them removed.\n\nIt was replaced in the submarine service in the 1980s by [[Mark 24 Tigerfish|Tigerfish]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== Mark 21 Pentane ==\nA project for an autonomous active/passive sonar torpedo to be carried by the [[Short Sturgeon]] anti-submarine aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skomer.u-net.com/projects/missiles.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601171206/http://www.skomer.u-net.com/projects/missiles.htm |archivedate=1 June 2009 }}</ref> It was cancelled after protracted work but the seeker development was used in Tigerfish.\n\n== Mark 22 ==\nA wire-guided version of the Mark 20 produced by [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering]] (VSEL) as a private venture.\n\n== Mark 23 Grog ==\nA wire-guided version of the Mark 20. Entered service in 1971 although already obsolescent, serving only as an interim before Tigerfish entered service.\n\nThe MK23 was fitted with a 10,000 &nbsp;m outboard dispenser that contains a control wire to guide the weapon, During 1973, all of the RN torpedoes had to be taken out of service as the control system was failing at extreme range.\n\nAfter months of investigation, it was discovered that the fault lay in the Guidance Unit made by GEC. A germanium diode in the AGC circuit had been replaced by a silicon diode, following an instruction by RN stores that all germanium diodes had to be replaced by silicon diodes. Unfortunately, the silicon diode's different characteristics caused the automatic gain control circuit to fail. Once the mistake was found, replacing the diode with the original type cured the problem.\n\n== Mark 24 Tigerfish ==\n{{Main|Mark 24 Tigerfish}}\n\nThe first Tigerfish (Mod 0) entered service in 1980. Tigerfish was removed from service in 2004.\n\nThere were several models of Tigerfish due to the modifications made to tackle deficiencies.\n* Mark 24 Mod 0 Tigerfish\n* Mark 24 Mod 1 Tigerfish\n* Mark 24(N) Tigerfish\n* Mark 24 Mod 2 Tigerfish\n\n== Spearfish ==\n{{Main|Spearfish torpedo}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[British 18-inch torpedo]]\n* [[List of torpedoes]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web |last=Tony DiGiulian |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PreWWII.htm |title=British torpedoes Pre World War II}}\n* {{cite web |last=Tony DiGiulian |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_WWII.htm |title=British Torpedoes of World War II}}\n* {{cite web |last=Tony DiGiulian |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PostWWII.htm |title=British Torpedoes post World War II}}\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20100311033414/http://middle-watch.com/Torpedoes.htm\n\n{{Royal Navy torpedoes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Torpedoes of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Axe99au", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMark 23 Grog:The source for this (Tony DiGuilan's article referenced on the page, which draws heavily on an article in Warship Volume V by Antony Preston) notes that the Mk 23 entered service in 1966, not 1971, but did not become fully operational until 1971.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_21-inch_torpedo"}
