In 1988, he was the campaign manager for [[Alan Keyes]]'s unsuccessful [[Maryland]] Senatorial campaign against [[Paul Sarbanes]].\n\nAfter teaching [[political philosophy]] and U.S. politics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Harvard's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School of Government]], Kristol went to work in government in 1985, serving as chief of staff to [[United States Secretary of Education|United States secretary of education]] [[William Bennett]] during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], and then as [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff to the vice president]] under [[Dan Quayle]] in the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush administration]]. ''[[The New Republic]]'' dubbed Kristol \"Dan Quayle's brain\" when he was appointed the vice president's chief of staff.\n\nHe served as chairman of the Project for the Republican Future from 1993 to 1994, and as the director of the Bradley Project at the [[Bradley Foundation]] in Milwaukee in 1993. In 1993, he led conservative opposition to the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]].\n\nIn 2003, Kristol and [[Lawrence F. Kaplan]] wrote ''The War Over Iraq: America's Mission and [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]]'s Tyranny'' (ISBN), in which the authors analyzed the [[Bush Doctrine]] and the history of Iraqi-U.S. relations.

In the first of what would become many strategy memos written for Republican policymakers, Kristol said the party should \"kill,\" not amend, President Clinton's health care plan. A later memo used the phrase \"There is no health care crisis,\" which Senate Minority Leader [[Bob Dole]] used in his response to Clinton's 1994 [[State of the Union]] address.\n\nKristol was a leading proponent of the [[Iraq War]]. In 1998, he joined other foreign policy analysts in sending a letter to President Clinton urging a stronger posture against Iraq.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/20/iraq.war.presser/ | title= Overthrow Hussein, U.S. group advises |date= February 20, 1998| website= CNN.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9_TPXLXEl8C&pg=PA139 | title=A Faustian Foreign Policy from Woodrow Wilson to George W.

In 2003, he and Lawrence Kaplan wrote ''The War Over Iraq,'' in which he described reasons for removing Saddam. Kristol rejected comparisons to Vietnam and predicted a \"two-month war, not an eight-year war\" during a March 28 [[C-SPAN]] appearance.<ref>{{cite web| title= The Rachel Maddow Show' for Monday, January 7th, 2013| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50397453/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/ |date= January 7, 2013|work= The Rachel Maddow Show |publisher= [[NBC News]] | access-date= 2014-01-30}}</ref>\n\nAs the military situation in Iraq began to deteriorate in 2004, Kristol argued for an increase in the number of U.S. troops in Iraq. He also wrote an op-ed strongly criticizing [[United States Secretary of Defense|United States secretary of defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], saying he \"breezily dodged responsibility\" for planning mistakes made in the Iraq War, including insufficient troop levels.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A132-2004Dec14.html The Defense Secretary We Have], William Kristol, December 15, 2004</ref> In September 2006, he and fellow commentator [[Rich Lowry]] wrote, \"There is no mystery as to what can make the crucial difference in the battle of Baghdad: American troops.\"<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/11/AR2006091100879.html | title= Reinforce Baghdad| first1= William |last1= Kristol |first2= Rich |last2= Lowry| work= Washington Post|date= September 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThis was one of the early calls for what became the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] four months later.

Miers is undoubtedly a decent and competent person. But her selection will unavoidably be judged as reflecting a combination of [[cronyism]] and capitulation on the part of the president.\"\n\nHe was a vocal supporter of the [[2006 Lebanon War]], stating that the war is \"our war too\", referring to the [[United States]].\n\nKristol was an ardent promoter of [[Sarah Palin]], advocating for her selection as the running mate of [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election]] months before McCain chose her.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mayer |first=Jane |authorlink=Jane Mayer |journal=[[The New Yorker]] | title=The Insiders: How John McCain came to pick Sarah Palin |date=October 27, 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=1 |access-date=2009-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |subject=Horton, Scott |subjectlink=Scott Horton (attorney) |interviewer=[[Glenn Greenwald]] | title=Salon Radio: Scott Horton |type=Transcript and link to Audio |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/radio/2008/10/15/horton/index1.html |date=October 15, 2008 |access-date=2009-06-21}}</ref> However, he later recanted his support for her, saying: \"I'm perfectly willing to say that given what I now know about her, she would not have been a good vice president.\"<ref>Reed, Elspeth (Aug 20, 2013).

In the near term, this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power.

In 2003, he and Lawrence Kaplan wrote ''The War Over Iraq,'' in which he described reasons for removing Saddam.

The Committee proposed that development should take place in three stages:\n* Stage one, which was to take three years, would see the transfer of Parliament and key administrative staff moved from Melbourne to Canberra.\n* Stage two, also to take three years, would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings\n* Stage three would create character and permanence in the capital.\n\nThe Committee was largely unsuccessful in achieving its aims, for example Parliament did not move to Canberra until 1927, and no permanent rail connection between [[Sydney]], Canberra and [[Melbourne]] was ever completed. However Sulman was instrumental in developing the [[garden city movement|garden city]] aspects of Canberra, he declared that the development of Canberra should take the form of \u2018a garden town, with simple, pleasing, but unpretentious buildings\u2019.\n\nIn 1924 the Committee was abolished due to the slow pace of development, it was replaced by the more successful Federal Capital Commission in 1925.\n\n== 1925\u20131930: Federal Capital Commission (FCC) ==\nThe FCC was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1 January 1925. The Chief Commissioner of the body was Sir [[John Butters]]. The FCC was to prepare Canberra for the arrival of 1,100 civil servants and their families.\n\nDuring the first 2 years of FCC operation [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]], [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], the [[Albert Hall, Canberra|Albert Hall]], the Institute of Anatomy, and the Australian School of Forestry and an Observatory on Mount Stromlo were completed. The FCC also oversaw construction of the Sydney and Melbourne commercial buildings in the [[City, Australian Capital Territory|City]] and significant residential development.\n\nThe FCC was disbanded on 1 May 1930 following the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Development after this point was not centrally planned until the establishment of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938.\n\n=== Federal Capital Architectural Style ===\n[[Image:11LaPerouseStFCCHouse.jpg|thumb|House in Griffith built by the Commission in the 1920s]]\nFederal Capital Commission architects designed houses in the new city and public buildings using a mixture of elements from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean]] and [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Architectural style|styles]]. The result is known as the FCC style and is unique to Canberra. FCC style houses can be found in the suburbs of [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory|Barton]], [[Braddon, Australian Capital Territory|Braddon]], [[Forrest, Australian Capital Territory|Forrest]] and [[Reid, Australian Capital Territory|Reid]].\n\nSir [[John Sulman]] began the development of Federal Capital Architecture.  Before emigrating to Australia in 1885, he had been a friend of [[William Morris]] and active in the Arts and Crafts movement.  Other than Sulman's leadership, the influences on the architects employed by the Federal Capital Authority and Commission were reflecting the thinking after the peak of the nationalistic Australian Federation style and looking to America for inspiration and seeking to practically respond to the Australian climate.\n\nBy the time Canberra was being built, the popularity of the uniquely Australian Federation style architecture was waning.  The architect [[William Hardy Wilson]] led the reaction against the ornateness of the Federation style and advocated adopting approaches from the United States.  When [[Leslie Wilkinson]] arrived in Australia in 1918 to take up his position as the first Professor of Architecture at an Australian university, he reinforced Wilson's view and advocated building appropriately for the climate, suggesting the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Spanish Mission style]] of architecture in California and Mexico as being an appropriate style for Australia.  When [[Walter Burley Griffin]] arrived in 1913, there was interest in the [[Prairie School|Prairie Style]] of mid-western America with which Griffin was associated.  The Classical revival style was popular in America, reflected in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  There was also interest in [[Neoclassical architecture|Classicism]] by English architects, including [[Edwin Lutyens]], who was responsible for many of the public buildings in [[New Delhi]] built from 1912 to 1929 in the wake of the decision to replace Calcutta as the seat of the British Indian government.\n\n==== Examples of FCC style ====\n<gallery>\nImage:Old Parliament House.jpg|Provisional Parliament House\nImage:Hotel Canberra.JPG|Hotel Canberra\nImage:Calthorpes House.jpg|Calthorpes' House\nImage:AlbertHallMildenhall.jpg|Albert Hall\nImage:CapitolTheatreManukapic583Alb827.jpg|Capitol Theatre, Manuka\nImage:ManukaPoolNLApic583alb827.jpg|Manuka Pool\nFile:Telopea park school-NLA01.jpg|Telopea Park school\nFile:ANU School of Art.jpg|Former Canberra High School (now the ANU School of Art)\nImage:SydneyAndMelbourneBuildingsCivic1929.jpg|Sydney and Melbourne buildings, Civic\n</gallery>\n\n== 1938\u20131957: National Capital Planning and Development Committee (NCPDC) ==\nThe NCPDC was formed in 1938 to oversee the development of Canberra. The NCPDC was to advise the Minister of the Interior to safeguard the Griffin plan and maintain high aesthetic and architectural standards worthy of a National Capital. The Committee had no executive power, and was unable to direct development of the Capital.\n\nDissatisfied with progress, the government established a Senate Select Committee in 1954 to inquire into Canberra's development. In 1958 it was replaced by the well funded and authoritative National Capital Development Commission.\n\n== 1958\u20131989: National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) ==\nThe NCDC was created to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government. It was created in 1957 through the ''National Capital Development Commission Act 1957''.\n\nUnder the control of the NCDC Canberra grew from a population of 40,000 to 300,000. The NCDC was responsible for the development of Canberra's satellite cities; [[Woden Valley]], [[Belconnen]], [[Tuggeranong]] and [[Gungahlin]]. The NCDC also oversaw construction of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and New Parliament House.\n\nThe NCDC had four Commissioners:\n* Sir [[John Overall (architect)|John Overall]], Commissioner, 1958\u20131972\n* W.C. Andrews, Commissioner, 1972\u20131974\n* Tony Powell, Commissioner, 1974\u20131985\n* Malcolm Latham, Commissioner, 1985\u20131989\n\nThe NCDC was advised by the National Capital Planning Committee which was chaired by the NCDC Commissioner and composed of six nominated representatives of the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]], the Institution of Engineers, Australia and the [[Royal Australian Planning Institute]] plus two other members with special knowledge and experience in cultural matters.\n\nThe NCDC was abolished after the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]'', and most of its functions passed to the new [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] government and the National Capital Authority.\n\n== 1989\u2013Present: National Capital Authority (NCA) ==\nThe National Capital Authority was established in 1989 when the [[Australian Capital Territory]] was granted self-government. The Authority consists of a Chairman and four other members, all members are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]].

The Committee proposed that development should take place in three stages:\n* Stage one, which was to take three years, would see the transfer of Parliament and key administrative staff moved from Melbourne to Canberra.\n* Stage two, also to take three years, would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings\n* Stage three would create character and permanence in the capital.\n\nThe Committee was largely unsuccessful in achieving its aims, for example Parliament did not move to Canberra until 1927, and no permanent rail connection between [[Sydney]], Canberra and [[Melbourne]] was ever completed. However Sulman was instrumental in developing the [[garden city movement|garden city]] aspects of Canberra, he declared that the development of Canberra should take the form of \u2018a garden town, with simple, pleasing, but unpretentious buildings\u2019.\n\nIn 1924 the Committee was abolished due to the slow pace of development, it was replaced by the more successful Federal Capital Commission in 1925.\n\n== 1925\u20131930: Federal Capital Commission (FCC) ==\nThe FCC was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1 January 1925. The Chief Commissioner of the body was Sir [[John Butters]]. The FCC was to prepare Canberra for the arrival of 1,100 civil servants and their families.\n\nDuring the first 2 years of FCC operation [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]], [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], the [[Albert Hall, Canberra|Albert Hall]], the Institute of Anatomy, and the Australian School of Forestry and an Observatory on Mount Stromlo were completed. The FCC also oversaw construction of the Sydney and Melbourne commercial buildings in the [[City, Australian Capital Territory|City]] and significant residential development.\n\nThe FCC was disbanded on 1 May 1930 following the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Development after this point was not centrally planned until the establishment of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938.\n\n=== Federal Capital Architectural Style ===\n[[Image:11LaPerouseStFCCHouse.jpg|thumb|House in Griffith built by the Commission in the 1920s]]\nFederal Capital Commission architects designed houses in the new city and public buildings using a mixture of elements from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean]] and [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Architectural style|styles]]. The result is known as the FCC style and is unique to Canberra. FCC style houses can be found in the suburbs of [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory|Barton]], [[Braddon, Australian Capital Territory|Braddon]], [[Forrest, Australian Capital Territory|Forrest]] and [[Reid, Australian Capital Territory|Reid]].\n\nSir [[John Sulman]] began the development of Federal Capital Architecture.  Before emigrating to Australia in 1885, he had been a friend of [[William Morris]] and active in the Arts and Crafts movement.  Other than Sulman's leadership, the influences on the architects employed by the Federal Capital Authority and Commission were reflecting the thinking after the peak of the nationalistic Australian Federation style and looking to America for inspiration and seeking to practically respond to the Australian climate.\n\nBy the time Canberra was being built, the popularity of the uniquely Australian Federation style architecture was waning.  The architect [[William Hardy Wilson]] led the reaction against the ornateness of the Federation style and advocated adopting approaches from the United States.  When [[Leslie Wilkinson]] arrived in Australia in 1918 to take up his position as the first Professor of Architecture at an Australian university, he reinforced Wilson's view and advocated building appropriately for the climate, suggesting the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Spanish Mission style]] of architecture in California and Mexico as being an appropriate style for Australia.  When [[Walter Burley Griffin]] arrived in 1913, there was interest in the [[Prairie School|Prairie Style]] of mid-western America with which Griffin was associated.  The Classical revival style was popular in America, reflected in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  There was also interest in [[Neoclassical architecture|Classicism]] by English architects, including [[Edwin Lutyens]], who was responsible for many of the public buildings in [[New Delhi]] built from 1912 to 1929 in the wake of the decision to replace Calcutta as the seat of the British Indian government.\n\n==== Examples of FCC style ====\n<gallery>\nImage:Old Parliament House.jpg|Provisional Parliament House\nImage:Hotel Canberra.JPG|Hotel Canberra\nImage:Calthorpes House.jpg|Calthorpes' House\nImage:AlbertHallMildenhall.jpg|Albert Hall\nImage:CapitolTheatreManukapic583Alb827.jpg|Capitol Theatre, Manuka\nImage:ManukaPoolNLApic583alb827.jpg|Manuka Pool\nFile:Telopea park school-NLA01.jpg|Telopea Park school\nFile:ANU School of Art.jpg|Former Canberra High School (now the ANU School of Art)\nImage:SydneyAndMelbourneBuildingsCivic1929.jpg|Sydney and Melbourne buildings, Civic\n</gallery>\n\n== 1938\u20131957: National Capital Planning and Development Committee (NCPDC) ==\nThe NCPDC was formed in 1938 to oversee the development of Canberra. The NCPDC was to advise the Minister of the Interior to safeguard the Griffin plan and maintain high aesthetic and architectural standards worthy of a National Capital. The Committee had no executive power, and was unable to direct development of the Capital.\n\nDissatisfied with progress, the government established a Senate Select Committee in 1954 to inquire into Canberra's development. In 1958 it was replaced by the well funded and authoritative National Capital Development Commission.\n\n== 1958\u20131989: National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) ==\nThe NCDC was created to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government. It was created in 1957 through the ''National Capital Development Commission Act 1957''.\n\nUnder the control of the NCDC Canberra grew from a population of 40,000 to 300,000. The NCDC was responsible for the development of Canberra's satellite cities; [[Woden Valley]], [[Belconnen]], [[Tuggeranong]] and [[Gungahlin]]. The NCDC also oversaw construction of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and New Parliament House.\n\nThe NCDC had four Commissioners:\n* Sir [[John Overall (architect)|John Overall]], Commissioner, 1958\u20131972\n* W.C. Andrews, Commissioner, 1972\u20131974\n* Tony Powell, Commissioner, 1974\u20131985\n* Malcolm Latham, Commissioner, 1985\u20131989\n\nThe NCDC was advised by the National Capital Planning Committee which was chaired by the NCDC Commissioner and composed of six nominated representatives of the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]], the Institution of Engineers, Australia and the [[Royal Australian Planning Institute]] plus two other members with special knowledge and experience in cultural matters.\n\nThe NCDC was abolished after the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]'', and most of its functions passed to the new [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] government and the National Capital Authority.\n\n== 1989\u2013Present: National Capital Authority (NCA) ==\nThe National Capital Authority was established in 1989 when the [[Australian Capital Territory]] was granted self-government. The Authority consists of a Chairman and four other members, all members are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. Under the '' Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'', the NCA has the authority to prepare and administer a National Capital Plan.\n\n== References ==\n*National Capital Authority.

He was the only Royal Governor of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to regain control of his colony during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJames Wright was born in [[London]] to Robert Wright junior, son of Sir  [[Robert Wright (judge, died 1689)|Robert Wright]],  [[Lord Chief Justice of England]], and Isabella Pitts, a widow. In 1730 his father accompanied [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] to the [[Province of South Carolina]] and served as its Chief Justice until 1739.  James followed soon after and began the practice of law in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].  In 1747 James was named [[Attorney General of South Carolina|colonial attorney-general]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deaton|first1=Stan|title=James Wright (1716-1785)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/james-wright-1716-1785|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> He also began amassing plantation lands.\n\nWright returned to London as an agent for the South Carolina colony in 1757. Then, in May 1760, he was named as Lieutenant Governor to [[Henry Ellis (governor)|Henry Ellis]] in Georgia. He returned to America and took up residence in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. When Ellis resigned he was appointed Governor in November 1760.  He was the third, and arguably most popular, Royal Governor of the colony. He sold many of his holdings in South Carolina, acquired land in Georgia, and moved his financial operations as well. With peace temporarily established with the [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]], he successfully negotiated with the [[First Nations|Indians]] and the Crown to open new lands to development. In his early administration, the new lands and economic improvement fostered the development of the Georgia colony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title=Answers to queries sent by the Lords of Trade [in] 1761, 1762|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:jwr001|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis first troubles came with the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765. But, in spite of efforts by the [[Sons of Liberty]] to block its implementation, Georgia was the only colony to import and actually use the revenue stamps. In 1768, Wright established the 12,000 acre settlement known as [[Wrightsboro, Georgia]]. Wrightsboro was set aside for displaced [[Quakers]] from [[North Carolina]]<ref>[http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro Historic Wrightsboro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313215224/http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro |date=13 March 2014 }}. exploregeorgia.org. Retrieved July 22, 2013.</ref> and became home to [[William Few]] when his family fled North Carolina after their farm had been burned and [[James Few]], William's brother had been hanged without a trial. As the [[American Revolution]] gathered momentum, Georgia remained the most [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyal]] colony\u2014due in part to its recent settlement, with many residents having direct ties through [[kinship]] in Great Britain, and, in part as well, to Wright's able administration. Georgia did not send delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] in 1774. That same year saw the death of his wife, Sarah.\n\nBy 1775, the revolutionary spirit had reached Georgia through the ''[[Committees of correspondence]]'' and he dismissed the assembly. But a revolutionary congress met that summer in Savannah and elected delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. Then, in early 1776, following [[Battle of the Rice Boats|the arrival of a small British fleet]], rebel forces entered his home and briefly took him prisoner. Wright escaped on February 11, 1776, via [[Bonaventure Plantation]] and with the assistance of two compatriots, Colonel John Mullryne and [[Josiah Tattnall, Sr.|Josiah Tattnall]],<ref>[https://www.telfair.org/article/bonaventure-a-historical-sketch/ \"BONAVENTURE: A HISTORICAL SKETCH\"] - [[Telfair Museums]], July 27, 2018</ref> to the safety of HMS ''Scarborough'', and sent a letter to his council. The congress and the Council adjourned without answering him.\n\nFor a time, Wright continued negotiations. He was even able to trade with the rebels to keep his offshore troops and ships supplied. But the differences continued to escalate. When his attempt to retake Savannah with naval forces failed, he returned to England.\n\nBy 1778, Governor Wright convinced the government to lend him enough troops to once again attempt to take Savannah. After some short but sharp fights, he [[Capture of Savannah|regained control of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778. While never fully in control of the state, he did restore large areas within Georgia to colonial rule, making this the only colony that was regained by the British once they had been expelled. He led a successful defense against several American and French attempts to capture the city. When the war was lost, he withdrew on July 11, 1782 and retired to England.\n\nWright's extensive properties were seized by the revolutionary governments in South Carolina and Georgia. He died in London, and is interred at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n== Wright's offspring==\nJames F. Cook in his book ''The Governors of Georgia 1754-2004'' states that Sir James Wright (1716-1785) and Sarah Maidman (died 1763) had nine children. They were:\n\n* Sir James Wright (1747&ndash;1816), the 2nd Baronet.

He was the only Royal Governor of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to regain control of his colony during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJames Wright was born in [[London]] to Robert Wright junior, son of Sir  [[Robert Wright (judge, died 1689)|Robert Wright]],  [[Lord Chief Justice of England]], and Isabella Pitts, a widow. In 1730 his father accompanied [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] to the [[Province of South Carolina]] and served as its Chief Justice until 1739.  James followed soon after and began the practice of law in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].  In 1747 James was named [[Attorney General of South Carolina|colonial attorney-general]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deaton|first1=Stan|title=James Wright (1716-1785)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/james-wright-1716-1785|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> He also began amassing plantation lands.\n\nWright returned to London as an agent for the South Carolina colony in 1757. Then, in May 1760, he was named as Lieutenant Governor to [[Henry Ellis (governor)|Henry Ellis]] in Georgia. He returned to America and took up residence in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. When Ellis resigned he was appointed Governor in November 1760.  He was the third, and arguably most popular, Royal Governor of the colony. He sold many of his holdings in South Carolina, acquired land in Georgia, and moved his financial operations as well. With peace temporarily established with the [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]], he successfully negotiated with the [[First Nations|Indians]] and the Crown to open new lands to development. In his early administration, the new lands and economic improvement fostered the development of the Georgia colony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title=Answers to queries sent by the Lords of Trade [in] 1761, 1762|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:jwr001|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis first troubles came with the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765. But, in spite of efforts by the [[Sons of Liberty]] to block its implementation, Georgia was the only colony to import and actually use the revenue stamps. In 1768, Wright established the 12,000 acre settlement known as [[Wrightsboro, Georgia]]. Wrightsboro was set aside for displaced [[Quakers]] from [[North Carolina]]<ref>[http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro Historic Wrightsboro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313215224/http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro |date=13 March 2014 }}. exploregeorgia.org.

As the [[American Revolution]] gathered momentum, Georgia remained the most [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyal]] colony\u2014due in part to its recent settlement, with many residents having direct ties through [[kinship]] in Great Britain, and, in part as well, to Wright's able administration. Georgia did not send delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] in 1774. That same year saw the death of his wife, Sarah.\n\nBy 1775, the revolutionary spirit had reached Georgia through the ''[[Committees of correspondence]]'' and he dismissed the assembly. But a revolutionary congress met that summer in Savannah and elected delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. Then, in early 1776, following [[Battle of the Rice Boats|the arrival of a small British fleet]], rebel forces entered his home and briefly took him prisoner. Wright escaped on February 11, 1776, via [[Bonaventure Plantation]] and with the assistance of two compatriots, Colonel John Mullryne and [[Josiah Tattnall, Sr.|Josiah Tattnall]],<ref>[https://www.telfair.org/article/bonaventure-a-historical-sketch/ \"BONAVENTURE: A HISTORICAL SKETCH\"] - [[Telfair Museums]], July 27, 2018</ref> to the safety of HMS ''Scarborough'', and sent a letter to his council. The congress and the Council adjourned without answering him.\n\nFor a time, Wright continued negotiations. He was even able to trade with the rebels to keep his offshore troops and ships supplied. But the differences continued to escalate. When his attempt to retake Savannah with naval forces failed, he returned to England.\n\nBy 1778, Governor Wright convinced the government to lend him enough troops to once again attempt to take Savannah. After some short but sharp fights, he [[Capture of Savannah|regained control of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778. While never fully in control of the state, he did restore large areas within Georgia to colonial rule, making this the only colony that was regained by the British once they had been expelled. He led a successful defense against several American and French attempts to capture the city. When the war was lost, he withdrew on July 11, 1782 and retired to England.\n\nWright's extensive properties were seized by the revolutionary governments in South Carolina and Georgia. He died in London, and is interred at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n== Wright's offspring==\nJames F. Cook in his book ''The Governors of Georgia 1754-2004'' states that Sir James Wright (1716-1785) and Sarah Maidman (died 1763) had nine children.
