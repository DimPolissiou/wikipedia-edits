Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

It was announced during the PlayStation 4 press conference on 20 February 2013, and, after several delays, was released worldwide in October 2014.\n\n''Driveclub'' is a racing game in which players compete in racing events around the world in a variety of different fashions. Players can compete in clubs with other players, earning a reputation as one of the best clubs, and leveling up to unlock better items. Another game mode is tour, essentially a campaign mode. Players can compete in standard races, as well as time trials, drifting events, and championship tournaments, which may take place in [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Scotland]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and [[Chile]]. Players may customize their car, their club, or their driver, and may complete optional challenges during events. A weather system and day-night cycle is also included as [[downloadable content]].\n\n''Driveclub'' was released to a fairly mixed critical reception. Critics praised the visuals, sound design, and the controls, but criticized the online playability, the inconsistent AI and a lack of gameplay variety. As of July 2015, the game has reached 2 million copies sold, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling PlayStation 4 video games|best-selling PlayStation 4 video games]].\n\nThe online servers for Driveclub were shutdown on 31 March 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashgear.com/ps4s-driveclub-will-shut-down-be-taken-offline-in-2020-31571657/|title=PS4's Driveclub will shut down in 2020|work=SlashGear|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=20 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Driveclub'' is a [[Racing video game|racing game]] in which players compete in races around the world in several different game modes. A major focus of the game is the club aspect. Players may join a club or create their own and will compete against other clubs to ultimately see whose club is the best. Clubs consist of up to six players. Players complete challenges together representing their club and earn fame and XP. The player earns fame by driving well and completing challenges. Fame determines the player's level as well as the club level. As the player levels up, they automatically unlock items, such as new vehicles, accolades, or colour schemes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/05/22/delving-into-the-user-interface-and-social-gaming-of-driveclub/|title=Delving Into The User Interface And Social Gaming Of Driveclub|work=TheSixthAxis|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> Every team member's action contributes to the club's overall success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/feature/a572687/how-ps4-racer-driveclub-puts-social-front-and-centre.html#~pcRyOdq77oy2UQ|title=How PS4 racer DRIVECLUB puts social front and centre|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe game's tracks and environments are inspired by real places in diverse regions across the globe, such as Norway and India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/769849-14-things-might-know-driveclub#/slide/13|title=14 Things You Might Not Know About Driveclub|first=Jonathon|last=Leack|work=[[CraveOnline]]|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> ''Driveclub'' features dynamic weather system such as rain and snowfall and a day-night cycle.

racing game to have enough faith in its core handling to eschew driving assists.\" He criticized the weak damage and characterized crashes as unsatisfying. He also discouraged playing unconnected, adding \"Never have I seen such a dull, lifeless and formulaic single-player mode transformed so spectacularly by online connectivity.\"<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dale North from [[Destructoid]] gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its responsive, satisfying control and impressive sounds, as well as highly detailed environments, while criticizing the lack of replay value, constant [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] car bashing and crashing in single-player and infrequent weird visual bugs in the in-car views, but still summarized the game as \"has enough to offer over other new and upcoming racing alternatives out there.\"<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nLudwig Kietzmann of [[Joystiq]] also praised the stunning environments and excellent sound design. However, he also criticized the abusive AI cars and considered them ruin the whole single-player experience because players often get bumped, smashed and shoved off the road repeatedly. He also criticized the lack of difficulty options.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> Luke Reilly of [[IGN]] gave the game a 7.9/10. He praised its great sense of speed and graphics, which is described as \"the best-looking racing game ever seen on a console\", but criticized the overly aggressive and frustrating AI grates and the difficult drifting when compared to the accessible handling, but still summarized the game as \"a modest, conventional arcade racer rather than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> John Robertson from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game an 8/10, also praising its graphics and the Clubs system, but criticizing the lack of variety in race types and challenges, as well as the arcade-handling, as he described it \"sits at odds with the purity of available events\".<ref name=\"CVG\"/>\n\nHowever, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 5/10. He praised the attractive cars and race tracks featured, but criticized the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the game. He also praised the graphics of the game, but stated that the environment and the surroundings are \"as lifeless as postcards\".<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]'s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly grippy car handling and lack of fun element.

A major focus of the game is the club aspect. Players may join a club or create their own and will compete against other clubs to ultimately see whose club is the best. Clubs consist of up to six players. Players complete challenges together representing their club and earn fame and XP. The player earns fame by driving well and completing challenges. Fame determines the player's level as well as the club level.

racing game to have enough faith in its core handling to eschew driving assists.\" He criticized the weak damage and characterized crashes as unsatisfying. He also discouraged playing unconnected, adding \"Never have I seen such a dull, lifeless and formulaic single-player mode transformed so spectacularly by online connectivity.\"<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dale North from [[Destructoid]] gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its responsive, satisfying control and impressive sounds, as well as highly detailed environments, while criticizing the lack of replay value, constant [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] car bashing and crashing in single-player and infrequent weird visual bugs in the in-car views, but still summarized the game as \"has enough to offer over other new and upcoming racing alternatives out there.\"<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n\nLudwig Kietzmann of [[Joystiq]] also praised the stunning environments and excellent sound design.

He also criticized the lack of difficulty options.<ref name=\"Joystiq\"/> Luke Reilly of [[IGN]] gave the game a 7.9/10. He praised its great sense of speed and graphics, which is described as \"the best-looking racing game ever seen on a console\", but criticized the overly aggressive and frustrating AI grates and the difficult drifting when compared to the accessible handling, but still summarized the game as \"a modest, conventional arcade racer rather than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> John Robertson from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game an 8/10, also praising its graphics and the Clubs system, but criticizing the lack of variety in race types and challenges, as well as the arcade-handling, as he described it \"sits at odds with the purity of available events\".<ref name=\"CVG\"/>\n\nHowever, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 5/10. He praised the attractive cars and race tracks featured, but criticized the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the game. He also praised the graphics of the game, but stated that the environment and the surroundings are \"as lifeless as postcards\".<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]'s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly grippy car handling and lack of fun element.

According to the [[Gospel]]s, [[Jesus]] was a [[rabbi|Jewish teacher]] and healer who proclaimed the imminent [[Kingdom of God]], and was crucified [[circa|c.]]30&#x2011;33&nbsp;[[AD]]. His followers believed that he was then [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised from the dead]] and exalted by God, and would return soon at the inception of God's Kingdom.\n\nThe earliest followers of [[Jesus]] were [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[Jewish Christian]]s. Due to the inclusion of [[gentile]]s, the developing [[Early Christianity|early Christian Church]] gradually [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|grew apart]] from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish Christianity]] during the first two centuries of the [[Christian Era]].\n\nIn 313, Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] legalizing Christian worship. In 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its state religion, and Christianity established itself as a predominantly [[gentile]] religion in the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].\n\nChristological debates about the human and divine nature of Jesus consumed the Christian Church for a couple of centuries, and seven eucumenical councils were called to resolve these debates. [[Arianism]] was condemned at the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325), which supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, missionary activities spread Christianity towards the west among German peoples. During the [[High Middle Ages]], eastern and western Christianity grew apart, leading to the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. Growing criticism of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[ecclesiological]] structure and its behaviour, led to the [[Protestant]] movement of the 16th century and the split of western Christianity.\n\nSince the [[Renaissance era]], with western [[colonialism]], Christianity has expanded throughout the world.<ref>Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']</ref> Today there are more than two billion Christians worldwide, and Christianity has become the world's largest religion.<ref>[[BBC]] documentary: A History of Christianity by [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], [[Oxford University]]</ref> Within the last century, as the influence of Christianity has waned in the West, it has also rapidly grown in the East and the [[Global South]] in China, South Korea and much of sub-Saharan Africa. There has been recent growth of Christianity in Iran.{{cn|date=May 2037}}\n\n==Origins==\n=== Jewish-Hellenistic background ===\n{{See also|Historical background of the New Testament|Second Temple Period|Second Temple Judaism|Judea (Roman province)}}\nThe religious climate of 1st century Judea was diverse, with numerous Judaic sects. The ancient historian [[Josephus]] described four prominent groups in the Judaism of the time: [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]] and [[Zealots]]. This led to unrest, and the 1st century BC and 1st century AD saw a number of charismatic religious leaders, contributing to what would become the [[Mishnah]] of [[rabbinic Judaism]], including [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] and [[Hanina ben Dosa]].\n\n[[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish messianism]], and the Jewish messiah concept, has its [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|roots]] in the [[apocalyptic literature]] of the 2nd century BC to 1st century BC, promising a future \"anointed\" leader ([[messiah]] or [[monarch|king]]) from the [[Davidic line]] to resurrect the Israelite [[Kingdom of God]], in place of the foreign rulers of the time.\n\n===Ministry of Jesus===\n{{Main|Jesus|Ministry of Jesus|Chronology of Jesus|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus|Life of Jesus in the New Testament}}\nThe main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four [[canonical gospels]], and to a lesser extent the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]]. According to the Gospels, Jesus was a Jewish teacher and healer who was crucified c.30\u201333 AD. His followers believed that he was raised from death and exalted by God due to his faithfulness.\n\n==Early Christianity (c. 31/33\u2013324)==\n[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Funerary [[stele]] of Licinia Amias on marble, in the [[National Roman Museum]].

It is typically divided into two periods: [[Christianity in the 1st century]] which is known as the ''Apostolic Age'' ({{circa}} 30\u2013100, when the first apostles were still alive) and the ''[[Ante-Nicene Period]]'' ({{circa}} 100\u2013325).<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Schaff | first1 = Philip | author-link1 = Philip Schaff | orig-year = 1858-1890 | title = History of the Christian Church | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6fBpjjN64sC | volume = 2: Ante-Nicene Christianity.

It holds special significance in Christian tradition as the age of the direct apostles of Jesus. A [[primary source]] for the Apostolic Age is the [[Acts of the Apostles]], but [[Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles|its historical accuracy is questionable]] and its coverage is partial, focusing especially from {{bibleverse||Acts|15:36|NKJV}} onwards on the ministry of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and ending around 62 AD with Paul preaching in [[Rome]] under [[house arrest]].\n\nThe earliest followers of [[Jesus]] were [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[Jewish Christian]]s. The [[Early Christian]] groups were strictly Jewish, such as the [[Ebionites]] and the early Christian community in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], led by [[James, brother of Jesus|James, the brother of Jesus]]. According to {{bibleverse||Acts|9:1\u20132|NKJV}}, they described themselves as 'disciples of the Lord' and [followers] 'of the Way', and according to {{bibleverse||Acts|11:26|NKJV}} a settled community of disciples at [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] were the first to be called 'Christians'.\n\nSome of the early Christian communities also attracted gentile [[God-fearers]], who already visited Jewish synagogues. The inclusion of gentiles posed a problem, as they could not fully observe the [[Halakha]]. Saul of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], commonly known as [[Paul the Apostle]], persecuted the early Jewish Christians, then [[Conversion of Paul|converted]] and started his mission among the gentiles. The main concern of Paul's letters is the inclusion of gentiles into God's [[New Covenant]], deeming faith in Christ sufficient for righteousness. Due to this inclusion of gentiles, early Christianity changed of character, and gradually [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|grew apart]] from Judaism and Jewish Christianity during the first two centuries of the [[Christian Era]]; eventually Christianity established itself as a predominantly gentile religion in the [[state church of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|left|Christ Jesus,<ref>\"The figure (\u2026) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd\" [[Andr\u00e9 Grabar]], ''Christian iconography, a study of its origins'', {{ISBN|0-691-01830-8}}</ref> the Good Shepherd, [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].]]\n\nThe Gospels and [[New Testament]] [[epistles]] contain early [[creed]]s and [[hymns]], as well as accounts of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the empty tomb, and Resurrection appearances.<ref>On the Creeds, see Oscar Cullmann, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'', trans.

By the beginning of the Nicene period, the Christian faith had spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and to [[North Africa]] and the East. A more formal Church-structure grew out of the early communities, and a number of variant Christianities developed. Christianity grew apart from Judaism, creating its own identity by an increasingly harsh [[Anti-Judaism|rejection of Judaism]], of [[Judaizers|Jewish practices]], and an acceptance of what some{{which|date=March 2020}} scholars have called [[religious anti-semitism]], however, many{{which|date=March 2020}} modern day Christian theologians reject this accusation. <ref name =\"Michael\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5G3feplFBYUC&pg=PA101&dq=religious+anti+semitism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv9OCW9OzMAhVIOz4KHTLvAhgQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=religious%20anti%20semitism&f=false| title = A Concise History of American Antisemitism | author= Robert Michael |publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | page = 101 | year = 2005 }}</ref>\n\n====Developing Church-structure====\nThe number of Christians grew by approximately 40% a decade during the first and second centuries.<ref name=\"Stark1997\">{{cite book|first=Rodney |last=Stark |title=The Rise of Christianity|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofchristiani00star|url-access=registration |accessdate=28 October 2012|date=9 May 1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-067701-5}}</ref> In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of ''[[bishop|episkopos]]'' (overseers, inspectors; and the origin of the term [[bishop]]) and ''[[presbyter]]s'' ([[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; and the origin of the term [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]), and then ''[[deacons]]'' (servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times in different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.<ref>Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [https://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [https://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]</ref>\n\n====Variant Christianities====\n{{Main|Proto-orthodox Christianity|l1=Proto-orthodox Christianity|Diversity in early Christian theology|l2=Diversity in early Christianity|Christian heresy#Early Christian heresies|l3=Early Christian heresies}}\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period.

Many variations in this time defy neat categorizations, as various forms of Christianity interacted in a complex fashion to form the dynamic character of Christianity in this era. The Post-Apostolic period was extremely diverse both in terms of beliefs and practices.

They produced two sorts of works: theological and \"[[Christian apologetics|apologetic]]\", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]].\n\n====Early art====\n[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child.

Moran Cruz 2004 p. 55\">R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55</ref> but his accession of was a turning point for the Christian Church.

Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nConstantine also played an active role in the leadership of the Church. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the [[Donatism|Donatist]] controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], the first [[ecumenical council]]. Constantine thus established a precedent for the emperor as responsible to [[God]] for the spiritual health of their subjects, and thus with a duty to maintain [[orthodoxy]]. The emperor was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.<ref>Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476\u2013752'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nConstantine's son's successor, his nephew [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], under the influence of his adviser [[Mardonius (philosopher)|Mardonius]], renounced Christianity and embraced a [[Neoplatonism|Neo-platonic]] and mystical form of paganism shocking the Christian establishment.<ref name=\"Ricciotti\">{{harvnb|Ricciotti|1999|p=}}</ref> He began reopening pagan temples, modifying them to resemble Christian traditions such as the episcopal structure and public charity (previously unknown in Roman paganism). Julian's short reign ended when he died while campaigning in the East.\n\n===Arianism and the first ecumenical councils===\n[[File:Christian states 495 AD (en).svg|thumb|Spread of Arianism in the Western Europe]]\n{{Main|Arianism|First seven ecumenical councils}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\nA popular doctrine of the 4th century was [[Arianism]], the denial of the divinity of Christ, as propounded by [[Arius]]. Although this doctrine was condemned as [[heresy]] and eventually eliminated by the Roman Church it remained popular underground for some time. In the late 4th century [[Ulfilas]], a Roman bishop and an Arian, was appointed as the first bishop to the [[Goths]], the Germanic peoples in much of Europe at the borders of and within the Empire. Ulfilas spread Arian Christianity among the Goths firmly establishing the faith among many of the Germanic tribes, thus helping to keep them culturally distinct.<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\">Padberg 1998, 26</ref>\n\nDuring this age, the first ecumenical councils were convened. They were mostly concerned with [[Christology|Christological]] disputes. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) resulted in condemning Arian teachings as heresy and producing the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\n===Christianity as Roman state religion (380)===\n{{Further|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Orient m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de l'Empire romain - Mosa\u00efque byzantine -2.JPG|thumb|An [[Eastern Roman]] [[mosaic]] showing a [[basilica]] with towers, mounted with [[Christian cross]]es, 5th century AD, [[Louvre]]]]\nOn 27 February 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], [[Gratian]], and [[Valentinian II]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its [[state religion]]. Prior to this date, [[Constantius II#Christianity under Constantius|Constantius II]] (337\u2013361) and [[Valens#Struggles with the religious nature of the Empire|Valens]] (364\u2013378) had personally favoured Arian or [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] forms of Christianity, but Valens' successor Theodosius I supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nAfter its establishment, the Church adopted the same organisational boundaries as the Empire: geographical provinces, called [[diocese]]s, corresponding to imperial governmental territorial division. The bishops, who were located in major urban centres as per pre-legalisation tradition, thus oversaw each diocese. The bishop's location was his \"seat\", or \"[[Episcopal see|see]]\". Among the sees, [[Pentarchy|five]] came to hold special eminence: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]]. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors. Though the bishop of Rome was still held to be the [[First among equals]], Constantinople was second in precedence as the new capital of the empire.\n\nTheodosius I decreed that others not believing in the preserved \"faithful tradition\", such as the Trinity, were to be considered to be practitioners of illegal [[heresy]],<ref>It is our desire that all the various nations... should continue to profess that religion which... has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness.

A particular consequence of this perspective was that Mary could not be properly called the mother of God, but could only be considered the mother of Christ. The most widely known proponent of this viewpoint was the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Nestorius]]. Since referring to Mary as the mother of God had become popular in many parts of the Church this became a divisive issue.\n\nThe Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&nbsp;II]] called for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431), with the intention of settling the issue. The councils ultimately rejected Nestorius' view. Many churches who followed the Nestorian viewpoint broke away from the Roman Church, causing a major schism. The Nestorian churches were persecuted and many followers fled to the Sasanian Empire where they were accepted.\n\nThe [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian (Persian) Empire]] had many Christian converts early in its history tied closely to the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] branch of Christianity. The Empire was officially [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and maintained a strict adherence to this faith in part to distinguish itself from the religion of the Roman Empire (originally the pagan Roman religion and then Christianity). Christianity became tolerated in the Sasanian Empire and as the Roman Empire increasingly exiled ''heretics'' during the 4th and 6th centuries, the Sasanian Christian community grew rapidly.<ref name=\"culture-61\">''Culture and customs of Iran'', p. 61</ref> By the end of the 5th century the Persian Church was firmly established and had become independent of the Roman Church. This church evolved into what is today known as the [[Church of the East]].\n\n===Miaphysitism===\n{{Further|Oriental Orthodoxy}}\nIn 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was held to further clarify the Christological issues surrounding Nestorianism. The council ultimately stated that Christ's divine and human nature were separate but both part of a single entity, a viewpoint rejected by many churches who called themselves [[miaphysites]]. The resulting schism created a communion of churches, including the Armenian, Syrian, and Egyptian churches.<ref>Bussell (1910), p. 346.</ref> Though efforts were made at reconciliation in the next few centuries the schism remained permanent resulting in what is today known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].\n\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main|Christian monasticism}}\n[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]] is a form of [[asceticism]] whereby one renounces worldly pursuits and goes off alone as a [[hermit]] or joins a tightly organized community. It began early in the Church as a family of similar traditions, modelled upon Scriptural examples and ideals, and with roots in certain strands of Judaism. [[John the Baptist]] is seen as an archetypical monk, and monasticism was also inspired by the organisation of the Apostolic community as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts 2]].\n\nEremetic monks, or [[hermit]]s, live in solitude, whereas [[cenobitic]]s live in communities, generally in a [[monastery]], under a rule (or code of practice) and are governed by an [[abbot]]. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits, following the example of [[Anthony the Great]]. However, the need for some form of organised spiritual guidance lead [[Pachomius]] in 318 to organise his many followers in what was to become the first monastery. Soon, similar institutions were established throughout the Egyptian desert as well as the rest of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Women were especially attracted to the movement.<ref>Jeffrey F. Hamburger et al. ''Crown and Veil: Female Monasticism from the Fifth to the Fifteenth Centuries'' (2008)</ref>\n\nCentral figures in the development of monasticism were [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]] in the East and, in the West, [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]], who created the famous [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages, and starting point for other monastic rules.<ref>Marilyn Dunn, ''Emergence of Monasticism: From the Desert Fathers to the Early Middle Ages'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[mosaic]] of [[Justinian I]] in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy.]]\n{{Main|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 6th century|Christianity in the 7th century|Christianity in the 8th century}}\nThe transition into the Middle Ages was a gradual and localised process. Rural areas rose as power centres whilst urban areas declined. Although a greater number of Christians remained in the [[Orthodox Church|East]] (Greek areas), important developments were underway in the [[Western Christianity|West]] (Latin areas) and each took on distinctive shapes.\n\nThe [[Bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]], the Popes, were forced to adapt to drastically changing circumstances. Maintaining only nominal allegiance to the Emperor, they were forced to negotiate balances with the \"barbarian rulers\" of the former Roman provinces. In the East the Church maintained its structure and character and evolved more slowly.\n\n===Western missionary expansion===\nThe stepwise loss of [[Western Roman Empire]] dominance, replaced with [[foederati]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas not controlled by the collapsing empire.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''A history of the expansion of Christianity: vol. 2, The thousand years of uncertainty: A.D. 500 \u2013 A.D. 1500''</ref> Already as early as in the 5th century, missionary activities from [[Roman Britain]] into the Celtic areas (current [[Scotland]], Ireland and [[Wales]]) produced competing early traditions of [[Celtic Christianity]], that was later reintegrated under the [[Holy See|Church in Rome]].\n\nProminent missionaries were Saints [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribes that invaded southern Britain some time after the Roman abandonment, were initially pagan, but converted to Christianity by [[Augustine of Canterbury]] on the mission of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. Soon becoming a missionary centre, missionaries such as [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Lullus]] and [[Boniface]] would begin converting their [[Saxons|Saxon]] relatives in [[Germania]].\n\nThe largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of [[Gaul]] (modern France) were overrun by the [[Franks]] in the early 5th century. The native inhabitants were persecuted until the Frankish king [[Clovis I]] converted from paganism to [[Roman Catholic]]ism in 496. Clovis insisted that his fellow nobles follow suit, strengthening his newly established kingdom by uniting the faith of the rulers with that of the ruled.<ref name=\"Janet L. Nelson 1996\">Janet L. Nelson, ''The Frankish world, 750\u2013900'' (1996)</ref>\n\nAfter the rise of the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and the stabilizing political conditions, the Western part of the Church increased the missionary activities, supported by the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kingdom as a means to pacify troublesome neighbour peoples. After the foundation of a church in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] by [[Willibrord]], backlashes occurred when the pagan [[Frisians|Frisian]] king [[Radbod, king of the Frisians|Radbod]] destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary [[Boniface]] was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia continuing missions in Germany.<ref name=\"Janet L. Nelson 1996\"/>\n\n===Byzantine iconoclasm===\n[[File:Andrej Rubl\u00ebv 001.jpg|thumb|[[Andrei Rublev]]'s [[Trinity]].]]\n{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}\nFollowing a series of heavy military reverses against the [[Islam|Muslims]], the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]] emerged in the early 8th century. In the 720s the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] banned the pictorial representation of Christ, saints, and biblical scenes. In the West, [[Pope Gregory III]] held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. The Byzantine [[Council of Hieria|Iconoclast Council]], held at [[Hieria]] in 754, ruled that holy portraits were heretical.<ref>Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754</ref>\n\nThe movement destroyed much of the Christian church's early artistic history. The iconoclastic movement itself was later defined as heretical in 787 under the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (the seventh ecumenical council), but enjoyed a brief resurgence between 815 and 842.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)==\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 9th century|Christianity in the 10th century|Christianity in the 11th century|Christianity in the 12th century|Christianity in the 13th century}}\n\n===Carolingian Renaissance===\nThe [[Carolingian Renaissance]] was a period of intellectual and cultural revival of literature, arts, and scriptural studies during the late [[Christianity in the 8th century|8th]] and [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th centuries]], mostly during the reigns of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers. To address the problems of illiteracy among clergy and court scribes, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court.\n\n===Monastic reform===\n[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|right|125px|thumb|A view of the Abbey of Cluny.]]\n\n====Cluny====\nFrom the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]] onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine rule]], the abbey of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church, at its height from the second half of the [[Christianity in the 10th century|10th centuries]] through the early [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th]].\n\n====C\u00eeteaux====\nThe next wave of monastic reform came with the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Movement]]. The first Cistercian [[abbey]] was founded in 1098, at [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]]. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine rule]], rejecting the developments of the [[Benedictines]]. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work.\n\nInspired by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]] the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the [[Christianity in the 15th century|15th century]] the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation\n<gallery>\nFile:Mapa cister.svg|The spread of the Cistercians from their original sites during the Middle Ages\nFile:Bernhard von Clairvaux (Initiale-B).jpg|[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Mendicant orders====\nA third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the [[Mendicant orders]]. Commonly known as friars, mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they emphasise preaching, missionary activity, and education, in a secluded monastery. Beginning in the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]], the [[Franciscan]] order was instituted by the followers of [[Francis of Assisi]], and thereafter the [[Dominican order]] was begun by [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]].\n\n===Investiture Controversy===\n{{Main|Investiture Controversy}}\n[[File:Canossa-gate.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at the gate of Canossa, by August von Heyden.]]\nThe [[Investiture Controversy]], or Lay investiture controversy, was the most significant [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|conflict between secular and religious]] powers in [[medieval Europe]]. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Pope Gregory VII]] concerning who would appoint bishops ([[investiture]]). The end of lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Empire and the ambitions of noblemen.\n\nBishoprics being merely lifetime appointments, a king could better control their powers and revenues than those of hereditary noblemen. Even better, he could leave the post vacant and collect the revenues, theoretically in trust for the new bishop, or give a bishopric to pay a helpful noble. The Church wanted to end lay investiture to end this and other abuses, to reform the episcopate and provide better [[pastoral care]].\n\nPope Gregory VII issued the ''[[Dictatus Papae]]'', which declared that the pope alone could appoint bishops. Henry IV's rejection of the decree led to his excommunication and a ducal revolt. Eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance (see [[Road to Canossa]]), though the [[Great Saxon Revolt]] and conflict of investiture continued.\n\nA similar controversy occurred in England between [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and episcopal vacancy. The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London, 1107, where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty.\n\nThis was a partial model for the [[Concordat of Worms]] (''Pactum Calixtinum''), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their [[canon (priest)|cathedral canons]]. As a symbol of the compromise, both ecclesiastical and lay authorities invested bishops with respectively, the [[Crozier|staff]] and the [[Ecclesiastical ring|ring]].\n\n===Medieval Inquisition===\n{{Main|Medieval Inquisition}}\nThe Medieval Inquisition is a series of Inquisitions ([[Roman Catholic]] Church bodies charged with suppressing [[heresy]]) from around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s). It was in response to movements within Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[Christian heresy|heretical]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]], in particular the [[Catharism|Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]] in southern France and northern Italy. These were the first inquisition movements of many that would follow. The inquisitions in combination with the [[Albigensian Crusade]] were fairly successful in ending heresy. Historian Thomas F. Madden has written about popular myths regarding the Inquisition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |title=The Real Inquisition: Investigating the popular myth |accessdate=6 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731045745/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |archivedate=31 July 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Conversion of the Scandinavians===\n{{main|Christianization of Scandinavia}}\nEarly evangelisation in Scandinavia was begun by [[Ansgar]], [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Bremen]], \"Apostle of the North\". Ansgar, a native of [[Amiens]], was sent with a group of monks to Jutland Denmark in around 820 at the time of the pro-Christian Jutish king Harald Klak. The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom.\n\nIn 829 Ansgar went to [[Birka]] on [[Lake M\u00e4laren]], Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's own steward Hergeir. Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianised at the time of rulers such as [[Saint Canute IV]] of Denmark and [[Olaf I of Norway]] in the years following AD&nbsp;1000.\n\n===Conversion of the Slavs===\n{{main|Christianization of the Slavs}}\n[[File:Sevastopol Chersonesus Saint Vladimir Cathedral IMG 0723 1725.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Korsun ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) [[Crimea]], a place where Russian historiography claims that East Slavic Christianity was born.]]\n[[File:Cyril Metodej.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Saint Cyril the Philosopher|St. Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|St. Methodius]] monument on [[Radho\u0161\u0165|Mt.

For example, in the 9th century [[Cyril and Methodius]] had extensive missionary success in the region among the [[Slavic peoples]], translating the Bible and liturgy into [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]. The [[Baptism of Kiev]] in 988 spread Christianity throughout [[Kievan Rus']], establishing Christianity among [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia.\n<gallery>\nFile:Kievan-rus-1015-1113-(en).png|Conversion of the Kievan Rus', the unified Rus' empire\nFile:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|The Baptism of Vladimir (Emperor of the Kievan Rus')\n</gallery>\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Bulgaria]] and [[Kievan Rus']]. The evangelisation, or Christianisation, of the Slavs was initiated by one of Byzantium's most learned churchmen\u2014the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (Photius). The Byzantine emperor [[Michael III]] chose Cyril and Methodius in response to a request from [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], the king of Moravia who wanted missionaries that could minister to the Moravians in their own language.\n\nThe two brothers spoke the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular and translated the Bible and many of the prayer books.<ref name=Pravmir>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |title=Sts.

The reasons for that decision were complex; the most important factors were that Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and [[East Francia]]; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth, while Boris also saw it as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs.<ref>Andreev, J., ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'', Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, pp. 73\u201374</ref><ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans.

These doctrinal issues were first openly discussed in Photius's patriarchate.\n\nThe Eastern churches viewed Rome's understanding of the nature of episcopal power as being in direct opposition to the Church's essentially conciliar structure and thus saw the two ecclesiologies as mutually antithetical.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Orthodox Church London |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-913836-58-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/orthodoxway0000ware }}</ref>\n\nThe other major irritant to Eastern Christendom was the Western use of the ''Filioque'' clause\u2014meaning \"and the Son\"\u2014in the Nicene Creed . This too developed gradually and entered the Creed over time. The issue was the addition by the West of the Latin clause ''Filioque'' to the Creed, as in \"the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father ''and the Son''\", where the original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today by the Eastern Orthodox simply states \"the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\" The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally, and therefore illegitimately, since the East had never been consulted.<ref>History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky {{ISBN|978-0-8236-8074-0}} Quoting [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] p. 87.</ref> In addition to this ecclesiological issue, the Eastern Church also considered the'' Filioque'' clause unacceptable on dogmatic grounds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by [[Vladimir Lossky]], SVS Press, 1997.

Photios was refused an apology by the pope for previous points of dispute between the East and West. Photios refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Eastern matters or accept the ''Filioque'' clause. The Latin delegation at the council of his consecration pressed him to accept the clause in order to secure their support.\n\nThe controversy also involved Eastern and Western ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church, as well as a doctrinal dispute over the ''Filioque'' (\"and from the Son\") clause. That had been added to the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Latin church, which was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great [[East-West Schism]] in the 11th century.\n\nPhotios did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]], the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims.\n\n===East-West Schism (1054)===\n{{Main|East-West Schism}}\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|The East-West Schism]]{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Crusades ===\n{{Main|Crusades}}\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The Crusader states of Jerusalem]]\nGenerally, the Crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of [[Teutonic Knights]] against pagan strongholds in North-eastern Europe (see [[Northern Crusades]]). A few crusades were waged within Christendom against groups that were considered heretical and schismatic (also see the [[Battle of the Ice]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade]]).\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Krak des Chevaliers]] was built in the [[County of Tripoli]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the Crusades.]]\n\nThe Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the [[Seljuk Turks]] closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].\n\nEmperor [[Alexius I]] asked for aid from [[Pope Urban II]] (1088\u20131099) for help against Islamic aggression. He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries. Instead, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the [[Council of Clermont]] on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels.\n\nThe [[First Crusade]] captured Antioch in 1099 and then Jerusalem. The [[Second Crusade]] occurred in 1145 when [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was retaken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem would be held until 1187 and the [[Third Crusade]], famous for the battles between [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]], begun by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by Venetians who used the forces to sack the Christian city of [[Zadar|Zara]].<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\">For such an analysis, see Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, ''Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300\u20131475''. 6th ed.

The City of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church patroned such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\nIn addition to being the head of the Church, the Pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of [[aqueducts in Rome]] that still function today.\n\nFrom 1505 to 1626, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], perhaps the most recognised Christian church, was built on the site of the old Constantinian basilica. It was also a time of increased contact with Greek culture, opening up new avenues of learning, especially in the fields of [[philosophy]], poetry, [[classics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[political science]], fostering a spirit of [[humanism]]\u2013all of which would influence the Church.\n\n==Reformation and Counter-Reformation==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century}}\n\n===Protestant Reformation (1521\u20131610)===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Protestantism}}\n[[File:Reformation.gif|thumb|Approximate spread of Protestantism after the Reformation, and following the Counter-Reformation.]]\n\nthe Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' by [[Martin Luther]] in 1517, there was no [[schism]] until the 1521 [[Edict of Worms]].

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments|The Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which [[Leo X|Pope Leo X]] awarded him the title ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the [[Church of England|English Church]]. England would later experience periods of reform and also Counter-Reformation. Monarchs such as [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[William Laud]] pushed the Church of England in different directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] and a state church that considered itself both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\" but not \"Roman\" (and hesitated from the title \"Protestant\"), and other \"unofficial\" more radical movements such as the [[Puritan]]s. In terms of politics, the English Reformation included heresy trials, the exiling of Catholic populations to Spain and other Catholic lands, censorship and prohibition of books, etc.<ref>Literature and censorship in Renaissance England, Andrew Hadfield, Palgrave Books, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Counter-Reformation (1545\u20131837)===\n{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}\nThe Counter-Reformation was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. In terms of meetings and documents, it consisted of the ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]'', the [[Council of Trent]], the ''[[Roman Catechism]]'', and the ''[[Defensio Tridentin\u00e6 fidei]]''. In terms of politics, the Counter-Reformation included heresy trials, the [[Huguenots#Exodus|exiling of Protestant]] populations from Catholic lands, the [[Salzburg Protestants#Defereggen Valley expulsion|seizure of children]] from their Protestant parents for institutionalized Catholic upbringing, a series of [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|wars]], the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (the list of prohibited books), and the [[Spanish Inquisition#Protestants and Anglicans|Spanish Inquisition]].\n\nThe Counter-Reformation also included the Catholic Reformation, which aimed at improving the Church from within.\n\n====The Council of Trent====\n{{Main|Council of Trent}}\n[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Council in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento]]\nThe [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563), initiated by [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as [[simony]], [[absenteeism]], [[nepotism]], the holding of multiple church offices by one person, and other abuses, as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, [[clerical celibacy]], the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|seven Sacraments]], [[transubstantiation]] (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences, etc. In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected. The Council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. [[Milan]]'s Archbishop [[Saint Charles Borromeo]] (1538\u20131584) set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.\n\n====Catholic Reformation====\nAlso part of this general effort, the simultaneous [[Catholic Reformation]] consisted of improvements in art and culture, anti-corruption measures, the founding of the [[Society of Jesus#Early works|Jesuits]], the establishment of [[seminaries]], a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. Also part of this was the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]].\n\nThe Papacy of [[Pope Pius V|St. Pius V]] (1566\u20131572) was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick, and supporting missionaries. The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] stated, \"Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism.\"<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch|MacCulloch, Diarmaid]], ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 404</ref>\n\nCatholic missions were carried to new places beginning with the new [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] in the Americas.\n\n==Church and the Enlightenment (1610\u20131800)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}\n\n===Trial of Galileo===\n[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|350px|''Galileo before the Holy Office'', a 19th-century painting by [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]]]]\nThe [[Galileo affair]], in which [[Galileo Galilei]] came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over his support of [[heliocentrism|Copernican astronomy]], is often considered a defining moment in the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]].\n\nIn 1610, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]]. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the [[Heaven]]s that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].\n\nIn reaction, many scholars maintained that the motion of the Earth and immobility of the Sun were [[heresy|heretical]], as they contradicted some accounts given in the [[Bible]] as understood at that time. Galileo's part in the controversies over [[theology]], astronomy and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633, on a grave suspicion of heresy.\n\n===Puritans in North America===\n{{Main|Puritan migration to New England (1620\u201340)}}\n{{See also|History of the Puritans}}\nThe most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540</ref> The Puritans, or [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism [[established religion|established]] as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, and thus they set out for the New World and the hopes of a Puritan utopia.\n\n==Early Modern era==\nThis is the period from the [[Industrial revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] until the mid 19th century.\nSee the [[French Republican Calendar]] and [[anti-clerical]] measures. See also the Holy League, the [[Battle of Vienna]], [[Cardinal Richelieu]], and [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\n===Revivalism (1720\u20131906)===\n{{Main|Revivalism}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century}}\nRevivalism refers to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and Wesleyan revival, called the [[Great Awakening]], in North America which saw the development of evangelical [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], and new [[Methodist]] churches.\n\n===Great Awakenings===\n[[File:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Philipp Spener]] the founder of [[Pietism]] ]]\n{{Main|First Great Awakening|Second Great Awakening|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies c. 1730\u20131740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263</ref> It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].\n\n===Restorationism===\n{{Main|Restoration Movement}}\n{{See also|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}\nRestorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the [[Early Christianity|early church]] as a model.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Models of Restoration\">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B.

Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. \"Restorationism\" is often used to describe the [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].\n\n====Jehovah's Witnesses====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]]\n\n====Latter Day Saint movement====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Community of Christ]] and numerous other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints sects]]. [[Latter Day Saints]], also known as Mormons, believe that [[Joseph Smith]] was chosen to restore the original organization established by Jesus, now \"in its fullness\", rather than to reform the church.<ref>{{Citation |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=B.H |title=History of the Church |place=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher=Deseret News |year=1904 |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m2bEVgSvbS8C&printsec=frontcover&q |isbn=1-152-94824-5}}</ref><ref>[[Doctrine and Covenants]] (LDS Church edition) [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.11?lang=eng 21:11] (Apr. 1830); [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.78?lang=eng 42:78] (Feb. 1831); [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.59?lang=eng 107:59] (Mar. 1835).</ref>\n\n==Late Modern era==\n{{main|History of Christianity of the Late Modern era}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 20th century}}\nThe history of the Church from the mid 19th century around period of the [[revolutions of 1848]] to today.\n\n===Modern Eastern Orthodoxy===\n\n====Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire====\n[[File:2003-04-18 Moscow Kremlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Churches of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], as seen from the [[Balchug]] ]]\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the [[Russian Empire]], expressed in the motto of the late Empire from 1833: [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism]].

The word \"liberal\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\n====Fundamentalism====\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian.\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"[[The Fundamentals|fundamentals]]\": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|return of Jesus Christ]].\n\n====Under/During Nazism====\n[[File:Papst Pius XI. 1JS.jpg|thumb|150px|Pope Pius XI]]\nThe position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.\nRegarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, \"There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.</ref> [[Pope Pius XI]] declared \u2013 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' \u2013 that Fascist governments had hidden \"pagan intentions\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and [[Totalitarian]] Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God, fundamental [[human rights]] and dignity. His declaration that \"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCatholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in [[Dachau]], and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37.</ref> Many Catholic laymen and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876\u20131958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2008), p. 332.</ref> A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the [[German Lutheran Church]], was complex. Though many<ref>http://www.catholicarrogance.org/Catholic/Hitlersfaith-1.html</ref> Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\n\n===Second Vatican Council===\n{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}\nOn 11 October 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was \"pastoral\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin.\n\n===Ecumenism===\n{{Main|Ecumenism}}\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"''Ecumenism''\" is derived from Greek {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness.\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\n\n====Catholic ecumenism====\n{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}\nOver the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]]. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.\n\nOn 30 November 1894, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published ''Orientalium Dignitas''. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\n\nSome of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. ''Filioque'', [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.\n\nWith respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.\n\n=== Pentecostal movement ===\n{{Main|Pentecostalism}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=300\n|image1=Countries by percentage of Protestants 1938.svg\n|image2=Countries by percentage of Protestants (2010).svg\n|caption2=Countries by percentage of Protestants in 1938 and 2010. Pentecostal and [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations fueled much of the growth in Africa and Latin America.}}\nIn reaction to these developments, [[Christian fundamentalism]] was a movement to reject the radical influences of philosophical humanism, as this was affecting the Christian religion. Especially targeting critical approaches to the interpretation of the Bible, and trying to blockade the inroads made into their churches by atheistic scientific assumptions, the fundamentalists began to appear in various denominations as numerous independent movements of resistance to the drift away from historic Christianity. Over time, the Fundamentalist Evangelical movement has divided into two main wings, with the label Fundamentalist following one branch, while [[Evangelical]] has become the preferred banner of the more moderate movement. Although both movements primarily originated in the English-speaking world, the majority of Evangelicals now live elsewhere in the world.\n\n====Ecumenism within Protestantism====\n[[Ecumenical]] movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church.\" This [[ecclesiology]] is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church.\" The \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the [[Trinity]], belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], and that He died and rose again bodily.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History|Bible|Saints|Religion}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Christianity: A History}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Christ myth theory]]\n* [[Christian anarchism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christianization]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[History of Christian theology]]\n* [[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[History of Oriental Orthodoxy]]\n* [[History of Protestantism]]\n* [[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Protestantism]]\n* [[Restoration Movement]]\n* [[Rise of Christianity during the Fall of Rome]]\n* [[Role of the Christian Church in civilization]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Timeline of Christian missions]]\n* [[Timeline of Christianity]]\n* [[Timeline of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Christianity by century}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[John Bowden (theologian)|Bowden, John]].

According to the [[Gospel]]s, [[Jesus]] was a [[rabbi|Jewish teacher]] and healer who proclaimed the imminent [[Kingdom of God]], and was crucified [[circa|c.]]30&#x2011;33&nbsp;[[AD]]. His followers believed that he was then [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised from the dead]] and exalted by God, and would return soon at the inception of God's Kingdom.\n\nThe earliest followers of [[Jesus]] were [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[Jewish Christian]]s. Due to the inclusion of [[gentile]]s, the developing [[Early Christianity|early Christian Church]] gradually [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|grew apart]] from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish Christianity]] during the first two centuries of the [[Christian Era]].\n\nIn 313, Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] legalizing Christian worship. In 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its state religion, and Christianity established itself as a predominantly [[gentile]] religion in the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].\n\nChristological debates about the human and divine nature of Jesus consumed the Christian Church for a couple of centuries, and seven eucumenical councils were called to resolve these debates. [[Arianism]] was condemned at the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325), which supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, missionary activities spread Christianity towards the west among German peoples. During the [[High Middle Ages]], eastern and western Christianity grew apart, leading to the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. Growing criticism of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[ecclesiological]] structure and its behaviour, led to the [[Protestant]] movement of the 16th century and the split of western Christianity.\n\nSince the [[Renaissance era]], with western [[colonialism]], Christianity has expanded throughout the world.<ref>Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']</ref> Today there are more than two billion Christians worldwide, and Christianity has become the world's largest religion.<ref>[[BBC]] documentary: A History of Christianity by [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], [[Oxford University]]</ref> Within the last century, as the influence of Christianity has waned in the West, it has also rapidly grown in the East and the [[Global South]] in China, South Korea and much of sub-Saharan Africa.

The ancient historian [[Josephus]] described four prominent groups in the Judaism of the time: [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]] and [[Zealots]]. This led to unrest, and the 1st century BC and 1st century AD saw a number of charismatic religious leaders, contributing to what would become the [[Mishnah]] of [[rabbinic Judaism]], including [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] and [[Hanina ben Dosa]].\n\n[[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish messianism]], and the Jewish messiah concept, has its [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|roots]] in the [[apocalyptic literature]] of the 2nd century BC to 1st century BC, promising a future \"anointed\" leader ([[messiah]] or [[monarch|king]]) from the [[Davidic line]] to resurrect the Israelite [[Kingdom of God]], in place of the foreign rulers of the time.\n\n===Ministry of Jesus===\n{{Main|Jesus|Ministry of Jesus|Chronology of Jesus|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus|Life of Jesus in the New Testament}}\nThe main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four [[canonical gospels]], and to a lesser extent the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]]. According to the Gospels, Jesus was a Jewish teacher and healer who was crucified c.30\u201333 AD. His followers believed that he was raised from death and exalted by God due to his faithfulness.\n\n==Early Christianity (c. 31/33\u2013324)==\n[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Funerary [[stele]] of Licinia Amias on marble, in the [[National Roman Museum]].

It is typically divided into two periods: [[Christianity in the 1st century]] which is known as the ''Apostolic Age'' ({{circa}} 30\u2013100, when the first apostles were still alive) and the ''[[Ante-Nicene Period]]'' ({{circa}} 100\u2013325).<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Schaff | first1 = Philip | author-link1 = Philip Schaff | orig-year = 1858-1890 | title = History of the Christian Church | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6fBpjjN64sC | volume = 2: Ante-Nicene Christianity.

It holds special significance in Christian tradition as the age of the direct apostles of Jesus. A [[primary source]] for the Apostolic Age is the [[Acts of the Apostles]], but [[Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles|its historical accuracy is questionable]] and its coverage is partial, focusing especially from {{bibleverse||Acts|15:36|NKJV}} onwards on the ministry of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and ending around 62 AD with Paul preaching in [[Rome]] under [[house arrest]].\n\nThe earliest followers of [[Jesus]] were [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[Jewish Christian]]s. The [[Early Christian]] groups were strictly Jewish, such as the [[Ebionites]] and the early Christian community in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], led by [[James, brother of Jesus|James, the brother of Jesus]]. According to {{bibleverse||Acts|9:1\u20132|NKJV}}, they described themselves as 'disciples of the Lord' and [followers] 'of the Way', and according to {{bibleverse||Acts|11:26|NKJV}} a settled community of disciples at [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] were the first to be called 'Christians'.\n\nSome of the early Christian communities also attracted gentile [[God-fearers]], who already visited Jewish synagogues. The inclusion of gentiles posed a problem, as they could not fully observe the [[Halakha]]. Saul of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], commonly known as [[Paul the Apostle]], persecuted the early Jewish Christians, then [[Conversion of Paul|converted]] and started his mission among the gentiles. The main concern of Paul's letters is the inclusion of gentiles into God's [[New Covenant]], deeming faith in Christ sufficient for righteousness. Due to this inclusion of gentiles, early Christianity changed of character, and gradually [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|grew apart]] from Judaism and Jewish Christianity during the first two centuries of the [[Christian Era]]; eventually Christianity established itself as a predominantly gentile religion in the [[state church of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|left|Christ Jesus,<ref>\"The figure (\u2026) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd\" [[Andr\u00e9 Grabar]], ''Christian iconography, a study of its origins'', {{ISBN|0-691-01830-8}}</ref> the Good Shepherd, [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].]]\n\nThe Gospels and [[New Testament]] [[epistles]] contain early [[creed]]s and [[hymns]], as well as accounts of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the empty tomb, and Resurrection appearances.<ref>On the Creeds, see Oscar Cullmann, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'', trans.

By the beginning of the Nicene period, the Christian faith had spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and to [[North Africa]] and the East. A more formal Church-structure grew out of the early communities, and a number of variant Christianities developed. Christianity grew apart from Judaism, creating its own identity by an increasingly harsh [[Anti-Judaism|rejection of Judaism]], of [[Judaizers|Jewish practices]], and an acceptance of what some{{which|date=March 2020}} scholars have called [[religious anti-semitism]], however, many{{which|date=March 2020}} modern day Christian theologians reject this accusation. <ref name =\"Michael\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5G3feplFBYUC&pg=PA101&dq=religious+anti+semitism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv9OCW9OzMAhVIOz4KHTLvAhgQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=religious%20anti%20semitism&f=false| title = A Concise History of American Antisemitism | author= Robert Michael |publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | page = 101 | year = 2005 }}</ref>\n\n====Developing Church-structure====\nThe number of Christians grew by approximately 40% a decade during the first and second centuries.<ref name=\"Stark1997\">{{cite book|first=Rodney |last=Stark |title=The Rise of Christianity|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofchristiani00star|url-access=registration |accessdate=28 October 2012|date=9 May 1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-067701-5}}</ref> In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of ''[[bishop|episkopos]]'' (overseers, inspectors; and the origin of the term [[bishop]]) and ''[[presbyter]]s'' ([[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; and the origin of the term [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]), and then ''[[deacons]]'' (servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times in different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.<ref>Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [https://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [https://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]</ref>\n\n====Variant Christianities====\n{{Main|Proto-orthodox Christianity|l1=Proto-orthodox Christianity|Diversity in early Christian theology|l2=Diversity in early Christianity|Christian heresy#Early Christian heresies|l3=Early Christian heresies}}\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]], particularly the [[Christology|divinity of Jesus]] and the nature of the [[Trinity]]. Many variations in this time defy neat categorizations, as various forms of Christianity interacted in a complex fashion to form the dynamic character of Christianity in this era. The Post-Apostolic period was extremely diverse both in terms of beliefs and practices. In addition to the broad spectrum of general branches of Christianity, there was constant change and diversity that variably resulted in both internecine conflicts and syncretic adoption.<ref>Siker (2000).

They produced two sorts of works: theological and \"[[Christian apologetics|apologetic]]\", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]].\n\n====Early art====\n[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child.

Moran Cruz 2004 p. 55\">R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55</ref> but his accession of was a turning point for the Christian Church. Constantine supported the Church financially, built various [[basilicas]], granted privileges (e.g., exemption from certain taxes) to clergy, promoted Christians to some high offices, and returned confiscated property.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nConstantine also played an active role in the leadership of the Church. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the [[Donatism|Donatist]] controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], the first [[ecumenical council]]. Constantine thus established a precedent for the emperor as responsible to [[God]] for the spiritual health of their subjects, and thus with a duty to maintain [[orthodoxy]]. The emperor was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.<ref>Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476\u2013752'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nConstantine's son's successor, his nephew [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], under the influence of his adviser [[Mardonius (philosopher)|Mardonius]], renounced Christianity and embraced a [[Neoplatonism|Neo-platonic]] and mystical form of paganism shocking the Christian establishment.<ref name=\"Ricciotti\">{{harvnb|Ricciotti|1999|p=}}</ref> He began reopening pagan temples, modifying them to resemble Christian traditions such as the episcopal structure and public charity (previously unknown in Roman paganism). Julian's short reign ended when he died while campaigning in the East.\n\n===Arianism and the first ecumenical councils===\n[[File:Christian states 495 AD (en).svg|thumb|Spread of Arianism in the Western Europe]]\n{{Main|Arianism|First seven ecumenical councils}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\nA popular doctrine of the 4th century was [[Arianism]], the denial of the divinity of Christ, as propounded by [[Arius]]. Although this doctrine was condemned as [[heresy]] and eventually eliminated by the Roman Church it remained popular underground for some time. In the late 4th century [[Ulfilas]], a Roman bishop and an Arian, was appointed as the first bishop to the [[Goths]], the Germanic peoples in much of Europe at the borders of and within the Empire. Ulfilas spread Arian Christianity among the Goths firmly establishing the faith among many of the Germanic tribes, thus helping to keep them culturally distinct.<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\">Padberg 1998, 26</ref>\n\nDuring this age, the first ecumenical councils were convened. They were mostly concerned with [[Christology|Christological]] disputes. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) resulted in condemning Arian teachings as heresy and producing the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\n===Christianity as Roman state religion (380)===\n{{Further|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Orient m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de l'Empire romain - Mosa\u00efque byzantine -2.JPG|thumb|An [[Eastern Roman]] [[mosaic]] showing a [[basilica]] with towers, mounted with [[Christian cross]]es, 5th century AD, [[Louvre]]]]\nOn 27 February 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], [[Gratian]], and [[Valentinian II]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its [[state religion]]. Prior to this date, [[Constantius II#Christianity under Constantius|Constantius II]] (337\u2013361) and [[Valens#Struggles with the religious nature of the Empire|Valens]] (364\u2013378) had personally favoured Arian or [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] forms of Christianity, but Valens' successor Theodosius I supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nAfter its establishment, the Church adopted the same organisational boundaries as the Empire: geographical provinces, called [[diocese]]s, corresponding to imperial governmental territorial division. The bishops, who were located in major urban centres as per pre-legalisation tradition, thus oversaw each diocese. The bishop's location was his \"seat\", or \"[[Episcopal see|see]]\". Among the sees, [[Pentarchy|five]] came to hold special eminence: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]]. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors. Though the bishop of Rome was still held to be the [[First among equals]], Constantinople was second in precedence as the new capital of the empire.\n\nTheodosius I decreed that others not believing in the preserved \"faithful tradition\", such as the Trinity, were to be considered to be practitioners of illegal [[heresy]],<ref>It is our desire that all the various nations... should continue to profess that religion which... has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching... let us believe in the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. ...others... shall be branded... heretics, and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. \u2014Henry Bettenson, ed., ''Documents of the Christian Church'', (London: Oxford University Press, 1943), p. 31</ref> and in 385, this resulted in the first case of capital punishment of a heretic, namely [[Priscillian]].<ref name=\"TheodosiusDecree\">{{cite web |title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=23 November 2006}}</ref><ref name = \"HereticsExecuted\">{{cite web | year = 2009 | url = http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/lecture27b.html | title= Lecture 27: Heretics, Heresies and the Church | accessdate =24 April 2010}} Review of Church policies towards heresy, including capital punishment (see Synod at Saragossa).</ref>\n\n===Nestorianism and the Sasanian Empire===\n{{Further|Christianity in the 5th century|Nestorian schism|Syriac Christianity|Church of the East}}\n[[File:Church of the East in the Middle Ages.svg|thumb|right|260px|Largely extinct [[Church of the East]] and its largest extent during the Middle Ages.]]\nDuring the early 5th century the [[School of Edessa]] had taught a Christological perspective stating that Christ's divine and human nature were distinct persons. A particular consequence of this perspective was that Mary could not be properly called the mother of God, but could only be considered the mother of Christ. The most widely known proponent of this viewpoint was the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Nestorius]]. Since referring to Mary as the mother of God had become popular in many parts of the Church this became a divisive issue.\n\nThe Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&nbsp;II]] called for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431), with the intention of settling the issue. The councils ultimately rejected Nestorius' view. Many churches who followed the Nestorian viewpoint broke away from the Roman Church, causing a major schism. The Nestorian churches were persecuted and many followers fled to the Sasanian Empire where they were accepted.\n\nThe [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian (Persian) Empire]] had many Christian converts early in its history tied closely to the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] branch of Christianity. The Empire was officially [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and maintained a strict adherence to this faith in part to distinguish itself from the religion of the Roman Empire (originally the pagan Roman religion and then Christianity). Christianity became tolerated in the Sasanian Empire and as the Roman Empire increasingly exiled ''heretics'' during the 4th and 6th centuries, the Sasanian Christian community grew rapidly.<ref name=\"culture-61\">''Culture and customs of Iran'', p. 61</ref> By the end of the 5th century the Persian Church was firmly established and had become independent of the Roman Church. This church evolved into what is today known as the [[Church of the East]].\n\n===Miaphysitism===\n{{Further|Oriental Orthodoxy}}\nIn 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was held to further clarify the Christological issues surrounding Nestorianism. The council ultimately stated that Christ's divine and human nature were separate but both part of a single entity, a viewpoint rejected by many churches who called themselves [[miaphysites]]. The resulting schism created a communion of churches, including the Armenian, Syrian, and Egyptian churches.<ref>Bussell (1910), p. 346.</ref> Though efforts were made at reconciliation in the next few centuries the schism remained permanent resulting in what is today known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].\n\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main|Christian monasticism}}\n[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]] is a form of [[asceticism]] whereby one renounces worldly pursuits and goes off alone as a [[hermit]] or joins a tightly organized community. It began early in the Church as a family of similar traditions, modelled upon Scriptural examples and ideals, and with roots in certain strands of Judaism. [[John the Baptist]] is seen as an archetypical monk, and monasticism was also inspired by the organisation of the Apostolic community as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts 2]].\n\nEremetic monks, or [[hermit]]s, live in solitude, whereas [[cenobitic]]s live in communities, generally in a [[monastery]], under a rule (or code of practice) and are governed by an [[abbot]]. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits, following the example of [[Anthony the Great]]. However, the need for some form of organised spiritual guidance lead [[Pachomius]] in 318 to organise his many followers in what was to become the first monastery. Soon, similar institutions were established throughout the Egyptian desert as well as the rest of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Women were especially attracted to the movement.<ref>Jeffrey F. Hamburger et al. ''Crown and Veil: Female Monasticism from the Fifth to the Fifteenth Centuries'' (2008)</ref>\n\nCentral figures in the development of monasticism were [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]] in the East and, in the West, [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]], who created the famous [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages, and starting point for other monastic rules.<ref>Marilyn Dunn, ''Emergence of Monasticism: From the Desert Fathers to the Early Middle Ages'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[mosaic]] of [[Justinian I]] in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy.]]\n{{Main|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 6th century|Christianity in the 7th century|Christianity in the 8th century}}\nThe transition into the Middle Ages was a gradual and localised process. Rural areas rose as power centres whilst urban areas declined. Although a greater number of Christians remained in the [[Orthodox Church|East]] (Greek areas), important developments were underway in the [[Western Christianity|West]] (Latin areas) and each took on distinctive shapes.\n\nThe [[Bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]], the Popes, were forced to adapt to drastically changing circumstances. Maintaining only nominal allegiance to the Emperor, they were forced to negotiate balances with the \"barbarian rulers\" of the former Roman provinces. In the East the Church maintained its structure and character and evolved more slowly.\n\n===Western missionary expansion===\nThe stepwise loss of [[Western Roman Empire]] dominance, replaced with [[foederati]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas not controlled by the collapsing empire.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''A history of the expansion of Christianity: vol. 2, The thousand years of uncertainty: A.D. 500 \u2013 A.D. 1500''</ref> Already as early as in the 5th century, missionary activities from [[Roman Britain]] into the Celtic areas (current [[Scotland]], Ireland and [[Wales]]) produced competing early traditions of [[Celtic Christianity]], that was later reintegrated under the [[Holy See|Church in Rome]].\n\nProminent missionaries were Saints [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribes that invaded southern Britain some time after the Roman abandonment, were initially pagan, but converted to Christianity by [[Augustine of Canterbury]] on the mission of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. Soon becoming a missionary centre, missionaries such as [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Lullus]] and [[Boniface]] would begin converting their [[Saxons|Saxon]] relatives in [[Germania]].\n\nThe largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of [[Gaul]] (modern France) were overrun by the [[Franks]] in the early 5th century. The native inhabitants were persecuted until the Frankish king [[Clovis I]] converted from paganism to [[Roman Catholic]]ism in 496. Clovis insisted that his fellow nobles follow suit, strengthening his newly established kingdom by uniting the faith of the rulers with that of the ruled.<ref name=\"Janet L. Nelson 1996\">Janet L. Nelson, ''The Frankish world, 750\u2013900'' (1996)</ref>\n\nAfter the rise of the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and the stabilizing political conditions, the Western part of the Church increased the missionary activities, supported by the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kingdom as a means to pacify troublesome neighbour peoples. After the foundation of a church in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] by [[Willibrord]], backlashes occurred when the pagan [[Frisians|Frisian]] king [[Radbod, king of the Frisians|Radbod]] destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary [[Boniface]] was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia continuing missions in Germany.<ref name=\"Janet L. Nelson 1996\"/>\n\n===Byzantine iconoclasm===\n[[File:Andrej Rubl\u00ebv 001.jpg|thumb|[[Andrei Rublev]]'s [[Trinity]].]]\n{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}\nFollowing a series of heavy military reverses against the [[Islam|Muslims]], the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]] emerged in the early 8th century. In the 720s the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] banned the pictorial representation of Christ, saints, and biblical scenes. In the West, [[Pope Gregory III]] held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. The Byzantine [[Council of Hieria|Iconoclast Council]], held at [[Hieria]] in 754, ruled that holy portraits were heretical.<ref>Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754</ref>\n\nThe movement destroyed much of the Christian church's early artistic history. The iconoclastic movement itself was later defined as heretical in 787 under the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (the seventh ecumenical council), but enjoyed a brief resurgence between 815 and 842.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)==\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 9th century|Christianity in the 10th century|Christianity in the 11th century|Christianity in the 12th century|Christianity in the 13th century}}\n\n===Carolingian Renaissance===\nThe [[Carolingian Renaissance]] was a period of intellectual and cultural revival of literature, arts, and scriptural studies during the late [[Christianity in the 8th century|8th]] and [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th centuries]], mostly during the reigns of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers. To address the problems of illiteracy among clergy and court scribes, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court.\n\n===Monastic reform===\n[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|right|125px|thumb|A view of the Abbey of Cluny.]]\n\n====Cluny====\nFrom the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]] onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine rule]], the abbey of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church, at its height from the second half of the [[Christianity in the 10th century|10th centuries]] through the early [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th]].\n\n====C\u00eeteaux====\nThe next wave of monastic reform came with the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Movement]]. The first Cistercian [[abbey]] was founded in 1098, at [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]]. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine rule]], rejecting the developments of the [[Benedictines]]. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work.\n\nInspired by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]] the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the [[Christianity in the 15th century|15th century]] the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation\n<gallery>\nFile:Mapa cister.svg|The spread of the Cistercians from their original sites during the Middle Ages\nFile:Bernhard von Clairvaux (Initiale-B).jpg|[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Mendicant orders====\nA third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the [[Mendicant orders]]. Commonly known as friars, mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they emphasise preaching, missionary activity, and education, in a secluded monastery. Beginning in the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]], the [[Franciscan]] order was instituted by the followers of [[Francis of Assisi]], and thereafter the [[Dominican order]] was begun by [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]].\n\n===Investiture Controversy===\n{{Main|Investiture Controversy}}\n[[File:Canossa-gate.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at the gate of Canossa, by August von Heyden.]]\nThe [[Investiture Controversy]], or Lay investiture controversy, was the most significant [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|conflict between secular and religious]] powers in [[medieval Europe]]. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Pope Gregory VII]] concerning who would appoint bishops ([[investiture]]). The end of lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Empire and the ambitions of noblemen.\n\nBishoprics being merely lifetime appointments, a king could better control their powers and revenues than those of hereditary noblemen. Even better, he could leave the post vacant and collect the revenues, theoretically in trust for the new bishop, or give a bishopric to pay a helpful noble. The Church wanted to end lay investiture to end this and other abuses, to reform the episcopate and provide better [[pastoral care]].\n\nPope Gregory VII issued the ''[[Dictatus Papae]]'', which declared that the pope alone could appoint bishops. Henry IV's rejection of the decree led to his excommunication and a ducal revolt. Eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance (see [[Road to Canossa]]), though the [[Great Saxon Revolt]] and conflict of investiture continued.\n\nA similar controversy occurred in England between [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and episcopal vacancy. The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London, 1107, where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty.\n\nThis was a partial model for the [[Concordat of Worms]] (''Pactum Calixtinum''), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their [[canon (priest)|cathedral canons]]. As a symbol of the compromise, both ecclesiastical and lay authorities invested bishops with respectively, the [[Crozier|staff]] and the [[Ecclesiastical ring|ring]].\n\n===Medieval Inquisition===\n{{Main|Medieval Inquisition}}\nThe Medieval Inquisition is a series of Inquisitions ([[Roman Catholic]] Church bodies charged with suppressing [[heresy]]) from around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s). It was in response to movements within Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[Christian heresy|heretical]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]], in particular the [[Catharism|Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]] in southern France and northern Italy. These were the first inquisition movements of many that would follow. The inquisitions in combination with the [[Albigensian Crusade]] were fairly successful in ending heresy. Historian Thomas F. Madden has written about popular myths regarding the Inquisition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |title=The Real Inquisition: Investigating the popular myth |accessdate=6 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731045745/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |archivedate=31 July 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Conversion of the Scandinavians===\n{{main|Christianization of Scandinavia}}\nEarly evangelisation in Scandinavia was begun by [[Ansgar]], [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Bremen]], \"Apostle of the North\". Ansgar, a native of [[Amiens]], was sent with a group of monks to Jutland Denmark in around 820 at the time of the pro-Christian Jutish king Harald Klak. The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom.\n\nIn 829 Ansgar went to [[Birka]] on [[Lake M\u00e4laren]], Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's own steward Hergeir. Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianised at the time of rulers such as [[Saint Canute IV]] of Denmark and [[Olaf I of Norway]] in the years following AD&nbsp;1000.\n\n===Conversion of the Slavs===\n{{main|Christianization of the Slavs}}\n[[File:Sevastopol Chersonesus Saint Vladimir Cathedral IMG 0723 1725.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Korsun ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) [[Crimea]], a place where Russian historiography claims that East Slavic Christianity was born.]]\n[[File:Cyril Metodej.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Saint Cyril the Philosopher|St. Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|St. Methodius]] monument on [[Radho\u0161\u0165|Mt.

For example, in the 9th century [[Cyril and Methodius]] had extensive missionary success in the region among the [[Slavic peoples]], translating the Bible and liturgy into [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]. The [[Baptism of Kiev]] in 988 spread Christianity throughout [[Kievan Rus']], establishing Christianity among [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia.\n<gallery>\nFile:Kievan-rus-1015-1113-(en).png|Conversion of the Kievan Rus', the unified Rus' empire\nFile:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|The Baptism of Vladimir (Emperor of the Kievan Rus')\n</gallery>\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Bulgaria]] and [[Kievan Rus']]. The evangelisation, or Christianisation, of the Slavs was initiated by one of Byzantium's most learned churchmen\u2014the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (Photius). The Byzantine emperor [[Michael III]] chose Cyril and Methodius in response to a request from [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], the king of Moravia who wanted missionaries that could minister to the Moravians in their own language.\n\nThe two brothers spoke the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular and translated the Bible and many of the prayer books.<ref name=Pravmir>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |title=Sts.

The reasons for that decision were complex; the most important factors were that Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and [[East Francia]]; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth, while Boris also saw it as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs.<ref>Andreev, J., ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'', Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, pp. 73\u201374</ref><ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans.

These doctrinal issues were first openly discussed in Photius's patriarchate.\n\nThe Eastern churches viewed Rome's understanding of the nature of episcopal power as being in direct opposition to the Church's essentially conciliar structure and thus saw the two ecclesiologies as mutually antithetical.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Orthodox Church London |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-913836-58-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/orthodoxway0000ware }}</ref>\n\nThe other major irritant to Eastern Christendom was the Western use of the ''Filioque'' clause\u2014meaning \"and the Son\"\u2014in the Nicene Creed . This too developed gradually and entered the Creed over time. The issue was the addition by the West of the Latin clause ''Filioque'' to the Creed, as in \"the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father ''and the Son''\", where the original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today by the Eastern Orthodox simply states \"the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\" The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally, and therefore illegitimately, since the East had never been consulted.<ref>History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky {{ISBN|978-0-8236-8074-0}} Quoting [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] p. 87.</ref> In addition to this ecclesiological issue, the Eastern Church also considered the'' Filioque'' clause unacceptable on dogmatic grounds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by [[Vladimir Lossky]], SVS Press, 1997.

Photios was refused an apology by the pope for previous points of dispute between the East and West. Photios refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Eastern matters or accept the ''Filioque'' clause. The Latin delegation at the council of his consecration pressed him to accept the clause in order to secure their support.\n\nThe controversy also involved Eastern and Western ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church, as well as a doctrinal dispute over the ''Filioque'' (\"and from the Son\") clause. That had been added to the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Latin church, which was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great [[East-West Schism]] in the 11th century.\n\nPhotios did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]], the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims.\n\n===East-West Schism (1054)===\n{{Main|East-West Schism}}\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|The East-West Schism]]{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Crusades ===\n{{Main|Crusades}}\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The Crusader states of Jerusalem]]\nGenerally, the Crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of [[Teutonic Knights]] against pagan strongholds in North-eastern Europe (see [[Northern Crusades]]). A few crusades were waged within Christendom against groups that were considered heretical and schismatic (also see the [[Battle of the Ice]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade]]).\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Krak des Chevaliers]] was built in the [[County of Tripoli]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the Crusades.]]\n\nThe Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the [[Seljuk Turks]] closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].\n\nEmperor [[Alexius I]] asked for aid from [[Pope Urban II]] (1088\u20131099) for help against Islamic aggression. He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries. Instead, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the [[Council of Clermont]] on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels.\n\nThe [[First Crusade]] captured Antioch in 1099 and then Jerusalem. The [[Second Crusade]] occurred in 1145 when [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was retaken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem would be held until 1187 and the [[Third Crusade]], famous for the battles between [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]], begun by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by Venetians who used the forces to sack the Christian city of [[Zadar|Zara]].<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\">For such an analysis, see Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, ''Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300\u20131475''. 6th ed.

He was a precursor of the Protestant Reformation. He emphasized the supremacy of the Bible, and called for a direct relationship between man and God, without interference by priests and bishops. His followers, called [[Lollards]], faced persecution by the Church of England. They went underground for over a century and played a role in the English Reformation.<ref>G. R.

The City of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church patroned such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\nIn addition to being the head of the Church, the Pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of [[aqueducts in Rome]] that still function today.\n\nFrom 1505 to 1626, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], perhaps the most recognised Christian church, was built on the site of the old Constantinian basilica. It was also a time of increased contact with Greek culture, opening up new avenues of learning, especially in the fields of [[philosophy]], poetry, [[classics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[political science]], fostering a spirit of [[humanism]]\u2013all of which would influence the Church.\n\n==Reformation and Counter-Reformation==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century}}\n\n===Protestant Reformation (1521\u20131610)===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Protestantism}}\n[[File:Reformation.gif|thumb|Approximate spread of Protestantism after the Reformation, and following the Counter-Reformation.]]\n\nthe Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' by [[Martin Luther]] in 1517, there was no [[schism]] until the 1521 [[Edict of Worms]].

They considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal, rather than simply a matter of moral weakness or lack of ecclesiastical discipline, and thus advocated for [[monergism|God's autonomy in redemption]], and against [[Voluntarism (philosophy)#Medieval theological voluntarism|voluntaristic]] notions that salvation could be earned by people. \n\nThe word ''Protestant'' is derived from the Latin ''protestatio'', meaning ''declaration'', which refers to the [[Protestation at Speyer|letter of protestation]] by [[Lutheran]] princes against the decision of the [[Second Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the [[Diet of Worms]] ordering the seizure of all property owned by persons guilty of advocating Lutheranism.<ref name=\"TECGlossary\">[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm Definition of Protestantism at the Episcopal Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815180519/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm |date=15 August 2007 }}</ref> The term \"Protestant\" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders; instead, they called themselves \"evangelical\", emphasising the \"return to the true gospel (Greek: ''euangelion'').\"<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. xx</ref>\n\nEarly protest was against corruptions such as [[simony]], the holding of multiple church offices by one person at the same time, episcopal vacancies, and the sale of [[indulgence]]s. The Protestant position also included [[sola scriptura]], [[sola fide]], the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]], [[Law and Gospel]], and the [[two kingdoms doctrine]]. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]], [[Presbyterian]], etc.), and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] traditions, though the latter group identifies as both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\", and some subgroups reject the classification as \"Protestant.\"\n\nChurches with Reformation confessions of faith spread almost entirely within the confines of Northern Europe, but this was checked by the Catholic response to the Reformation. This is known as the [[Counter Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]]. Although Protestants were excommunicated in an attempt to reduce their influence within the Catholic Church, at the same time they were also persecuted during the Counter-Reformation, prompting some to live as [[crypto-protestantism|crypto-Protestants]] (also termed [[Nicodemite]]s, against the urging of John Calvin who urged them to live their faith openly.<ref>Eire, Carlos M.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments|The Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which [[Leo X|Pope Leo X]] awarded him the title ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the [[Church of England|English Church]]. England would later experience periods of reform and also Counter-Reformation. Monarchs such as [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[William Laud]] pushed the Church of England in different directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] and a state church that considered itself both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\" but not \"Roman\" (and hesitated from the title \"Protestant\"), and other \"unofficial\" more radical movements such as the [[Puritan]]s. In terms of politics, the English Reformation included heresy trials, the exiling of Catholic populations to Spain and other Catholic lands, censorship and prohibition of books, etc.<ref>Literature and censorship in Renaissance England, Andrew Hadfield, Palgrave Books, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Counter-Reformation (1545\u20131837)===\n{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}\nThe Counter-Reformation was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. In terms of meetings and documents, it consisted of the ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]'', the [[Council of Trent]], the ''[[Roman Catechism]]'', and the ''[[Defensio Tridentin\u00e6 fidei]]''. In terms of politics, the Counter-Reformation included heresy trials, the [[Huguenots#Exodus|exiling of Protestant]] populations from Catholic lands, the [[Salzburg Protestants#Defereggen Valley expulsion|seizure of children]] from their Protestant parents for institutionalized Catholic upbringing, a series of [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|wars]], the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (the list of prohibited books), and the [[Spanish Inquisition#Protestants and Anglicans|Spanish Inquisition]].\n\nThe Counter-Reformation also included the Catholic Reformation, which aimed at improving the Church from within.\n\n====The Council of Trent====\n{{Main|Council of Trent}}\n[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Council in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento]]\nThe [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563), initiated by [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as [[simony]], [[absenteeism]], [[nepotism]], the holding of multiple church offices by one person, and other abuses, as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, [[clerical celibacy]], the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|seven Sacraments]], [[transubstantiation]] (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences, etc. In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected. The Council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. [[Milan]]'s Archbishop [[Saint Charles Borromeo]] (1538\u20131584) set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.\n\n====Catholic Reformation====\nAlso part of this general effort, the simultaneous [[Catholic Reformation]] consisted of improvements in art and culture, anti-corruption measures, the founding of the [[Society of Jesus#Early works|Jesuits]], the establishment of [[seminaries]], a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. Also part of this was the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]].\n\nThe Papacy of [[Pope Pius V|St. Pius V]] (1566\u20131572) was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick, and supporting missionaries. The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] stated, \"Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism.\"<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch|MacCulloch, Diarmaid]], ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 404</ref>\n\nCatholic missions were carried to new places beginning with the new [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] in the Americas.\n\n==Church and the Enlightenment (1610\u20131800)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}\n\n===Trial of Galileo===\n[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|350px|''Galileo before the Holy Office'', a 19th-century painting by [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]]]]\nThe [[Galileo affair]], in which [[Galileo Galilei]] came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over his support of [[heliocentrism|Copernican astronomy]], is often considered a defining moment in the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]].\n\nIn 1610, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]]. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the [[Heaven]]s that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].\n\nIn reaction, many scholars maintained that the motion of the Earth and immobility of the Sun were [[heresy|heretical]], as they contradicted some accounts given in the [[Bible]] as understood at that time. Galileo's part in the controversies over [[theology]], astronomy and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633, on a grave suspicion of heresy.\n\n===Puritans in North America===\n{{Main|Puritan migration to New England (1620\u201340)}}\n{{See also|History of the Puritans}}\nThe most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America.

The Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].\n\n===Restorationism===\n{{Main|Restoration Movement}}\n{{See also|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}\nRestorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the [[Early Christianity|early church]] as a model.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Models of Restoration\">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. \"Restorationism\" is often used to describe the [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].\n\n====Jehovah's Witnesses====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]]\n\n====Latter Day Saint movement====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Community of Christ]] and numerous other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints sects]].

The word \"liberal\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\n====Fundamentalism====\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian.\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"[[The Fundamentals|fundamentals]]\": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|return of Jesus Christ]].\n\n====Under/During Nazism====\n[[File:Papst Pius XI. 1JS.jpg|thumb|150px|Pope Pius XI]]\nThe position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.\nRegarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, \"There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.</ref> [[Pope Pius XI]] declared \u2013 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' \u2013 that Fascist governments had hidden \"pagan intentions\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and [[Totalitarian]] Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God, fundamental [[human rights]] and dignity. His declaration that \"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCatholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in [[Dachau]], and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37.</ref> Many Catholic laymen and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876\u20131958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2008), p. 332.</ref> A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the [[German Lutheran Church]], was complex. Though many<ref>http://www.catholicarrogance.org/Catholic/Hitlersfaith-1.html</ref> Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\n\n===Second Vatican Council===\n{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}\nOn 11 October 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was \"pastoral\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin.\n\n===Ecumenism===\n{{Main|Ecumenism}}\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"''Ecumenism''\" is derived from Greek {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness.\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\n\n====Catholic ecumenism====\n{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}\nOver the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]]. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.\n\nOn 30 November 1894, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published ''Orientalium Dignitas''. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\n\nSome of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. ''Filioque'', [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.\n\nWith respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.\n\n=== Pentecostal movement ===\n{{Main|Pentecostalism}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=300\n|image1=Countries by percentage of Protestants 1938.svg\n|image2=Countries by percentage of Protestants (2010).svg\n|caption2=Countries by percentage of Protestants in 1938 and 2010. Pentecostal and [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations fueled much of the growth in Africa and Latin America.}}\nIn reaction to these developments, [[Christian fundamentalism]] was a movement to reject the radical influences of philosophical humanism, as this was affecting the Christian religion. Especially targeting critical approaches to the interpretation of the Bible, and trying to blockade the inroads made into their churches by atheistic scientific assumptions, the fundamentalists began to appear in various denominations as numerous independent movements of resistance to the drift away from historic Christianity. Over time, the Fundamentalist Evangelical movement has divided into two main wings, with the label Fundamentalist following one branch, while [[Evangelical]] has become the preferred banner of the more moderate movement. Although both movements primarily originated in the English-speaking world, the majority of Evangelicals now live elsewhere in the world.\n\n====Ecumenism within Protestantism====\n[[Ecumenical]] movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church.\" This [[ecclesiology]] is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church.\" The \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the [[Trinity]], belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], and that He died and rose again bodily.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History|Bible|Saints|Religion}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Christianity: A History}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Christ myth theory]]\n* [[Christian anarchism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christianization]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[History of Christian theology]]\n* [[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[History of Oriental Orthodoxy]]\n* [[History of Protestantism]]\n* [[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Protestantism]]\n* [[Restoration Movement]]\n* [[Rise of Christianity during the Fall of Rome]]\n* [[Role of the Christian Church in civilization]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Timeline of Christian missions]]\n* [[Timeline of Christianity]]\n* [[Timeline of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Christianity by century}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[John Bowden (theologian)|Bowden, John]].

Murugesan and Arivazhagan are Sundarapandian's close friends from the same town. Arivu had failed in his board exams twice and is now in college final year, while Sundarapandian completed college two years ago and is now living freely. Arivu falls in love with Archana, who lives in a small village near Usilampatti and sees daily on the bus from Madurai to Theni. Arivu is scared to propose his love and decides to get the help of Sundarapandian in expressing love.\n\nSundarapandian, Murugesan, and Arivu board the route bus daily in which Archana travels to her college. Bhuvaneshwaran also loves Archana and travels in the same bus, also trying to propose to her. There arises a clash between Arivu and Bhuvanesh. They resolve it, as Bhuvanesh's native close friend is Sundarapandian's classmate Paranjothi. They give Bhuvanesh 31 days to woo Archana, without any of them intervening, failing which he should not disturb her anymore ever. Bhuvanesh fails and seemingly leaves way for Arivu. There, it is revealed that three years ago, Sundarapandian had proposed to Archana, and she had rejected him. Upon Arivu's urging, Sundarapandian goes to Archana to give his proposal. The next day, Archana suddenly proposes to Sundarapandian, which shocks everyone. Archana likes Sundarapandian and was waiting to meet him to convey her love towards him. Arivu accepts to leave his love, and Sundarapandian accepts Archana, but her parents wanted her to marry their close relative Jegan, although she is not interested.\n\nArchana had asked Sundarapandian not to contact her as she has exams coming. Bhuvanesh uses this time and verbally harasses Archana in the bus. Sundarapandian catches him and warns him not to repeat it. Sundarapandian asks Bhuvanesh to stop following Archana. The next day, Bhuvanesh comes with two of his friends and again insults Archana. Sundarapandian and his friends board the bus halfway, and a clash erupts between Sundarapandian and Bhuvanesh while travelling in the bus. Suddenly, Bhuvanesh is pushed out of the moving bus, which leads to his death. Sundarapandian is arrested for the murder but gets bailed from the case as it was termed as an accident. Raghupathi agrees to take care of Bhuvanesh's ailing parents and give money for his sister's marriage, but some of Bhuvanesh's friends wait for the right time to take revenge on Sundarapandian. Paranjothi is also angry on Sundarapandian but does not express it. Instead, he behaves normally and waits for the right time to take revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Archana's parents try to force her to marry Jegan. Raghupathi comes to Archana's home with a marriage proposal between Archana and Sundarapandian. Raghupathi requests Archana's father Pandi to set aside the ego and fulfill his daughter's wish by getting her married to Sundarapandian. Pandi is convinced by Raghupathi's speech and agrees for the wedding with Sundarapandian. Jegan gets furious knowing that Archana is about to get married to someone else. He is even more shocked to know that Sundarapandian is none other than his close friend in college but has lost contact after college days. Jegan decides to kill Sundarapandian, and Paranjothi decides to help him.\n\nParanjothi meets Sundarapandian and informs about Jegan's love towards Archana. He also lies that Jegan is transforming into a drunkard, worrying about his love in the outskirts of the town. Sundarapandian decides to meet Jegan and try to bring back him to normal. In the meantime, Paranjothi and Jegan have planned to kill Sundarapandian while he comes to meet Jegan. Arivu accompanies Sundarapandian while on the way to meet Jegan. In the outskirts forests of the town, Sundarapandian meets Jegan and requests him to behave normally. He apologizes, saying that he never knew about his love towards Archana before, but Jegan does not listen to Sundarapandian and tries attacking him along with Paranjothi. Sundarapandian pushes them away and tries to escape from the place. Unfortunately, to his shock, Arivu stabs Sundarapandian in his back because has vengeance regarding his love for Archana.\n\nSundarapandian feels bad that all his friends betrayed him. However, he retaliates and hits back at Paranjothi, Jegan and Arivu with the help of weapons. All three are badly hurt and fall on the ground. Sundarapandian reveals that he knew long before that Paranjothi sought revenge on him for Bhuvanesh's death (a group had a man wearing Paranjothi's shirt who had come to kill Sundapandian before). He also  reveals that Arivu pushed Bhuvanesh from the moving bus during the clash, but everyone misunderstood that it was Sundarapandian. Sundarapandian decided to take the blame as he does not want his poor friend Arivu's life to be spoiled. He also scolds Jegan for forcefully trying to marry Archana, despite knowing that she is not interested.\n\nSundarapandian and Archana later get married. The movie ends showing that Sundarapandian did not disclose the betrayal committed by his friends to anyone but instead ended his friendship with them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[M.
