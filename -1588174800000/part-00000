Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} From this point on, argue Candlin and Pybus, \"the British reoccupied Grenada with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to send a clear message of racial superiority and religious intolerance\".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=22}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} In the early days of the revolution, French planters appear to have remained resistant to the revolution's call to violence; in August 1790 for example, F\u00e9don himself signed a petition against growing radicalism on the island, which claimed that both French and English planters were at risk.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \"found cowering in their plantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nAt the time of the rebellion, Grenada had a population of approximately 1,125 free coloured\nresidents\u2014including 940 French free coloureds\u2014and 185 British citizens.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman|free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}} The long term origin of the revolt, argues Jacobs, was \"more than a century of slave resistance and also in French discontent over British rule\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} \n\nBritish ([[Protestant]]){{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} especially against the French\u2014Catholic{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\u2014inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The [[French language]] had been all but eradicated officially, and vestiges of [[French law]] also.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}{{refn|Britain's harsh treatment of the Grenadans, suggest Candlin, can be compared to that of the Spanish who \"showed a particularly lenient attitude to people of mixed race\" and encouraged emigration to their [[Trinidad]] lands.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}|group=note}} The large number of French coloureds worried the British, who, says Candlin \"regarded them first with deep suspicion then actively\ntried to oppress them through legislation, each law underscoring further the inherent dif\ufb01culty members of the white community had at distinguishing friend from foe\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}{{refn|Legislation included restrictions on the holding of unregulated ceremonies, coloureds being forbidden to walk at night without a lantern to light them, a [[curfew]] and weapons restrictions.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} On one occasion, F\u00e9don's wife had been arrested for breaching a restriction and had been imprisoned for some weeks before he could secure her release.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} Marie-Rose F\u00e9don had been unable to prove she was a free woman under a ruling enacted the previous year. Those unable to do so within six weeks were to be sold into slavery.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=21}}{{refn|Candlin and Pybus describe Marie rose as{{blockquote|text=contemptuous of such laws...She understood the law and its implications, but she was proud of her French heritage and the liberties she had previously enjoyed.\nShe saw no reason to travel the fourteen or so miles from [their estate] to the capital to prove who she was to the Anglo interlopers.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=21}}}}|group=note}}\n\nFor their part, the British\u2014who knew what had happened in other islands\u2014expected \"anarchy, confusion and killings...Increasingly the governor\u2019s correspondence was \ufb01lled with worries for security and his fear of the island's French inhabitants, especially the free coloureds\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n===Planning===\nPlanning of the rebellion began in 1793, possibly as a direct result of the appointment of Ninian Home as governor:{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} Home, a Scotsman,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} was an established persecutor of Catholics.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}}{{refn|Note that this was a year before the arrival of Victor Hugues in Guadeloupe, bringing news of the [[National Convention]]'s abolishment of slavery in, and extension of citizenship to, [[Overseas France|French overseas territories]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}}|group=note}}  The conspiracy was composed of a [[kernal]] of around 50 individuals and of diverse social composition, including white [[bourgeoise]] and free-French blacks. No slaves, however, appear to have been involved in the planning stages of the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nSupplies were initially received by French revolutionaries in [[Guadeloupe]]\u2014including [[materiel]] and financing\u2014under [[Victor Hugues]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The conspiracy had been successfully hidden from the authorities, notes Martin, and \"it wasn't until the day leading up to the rebellion that some British residents began to notice unusual activities among the rebels, but by then it was too late to act\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nThe conspirators' headquarters was F\u00e9don's remote [[plantation]] in Belvidere Estate.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} This was situated up a mountain in the middle of a cocoa and coffee plantation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} In February, F\u00e9don despatched Nogues and Lavalee to Guadeloupe, seeking the assistance of the new French republican government under [[Victor Huges]]. Only absent a few days, when they returned it was bearing the rank of captain in the French revolutionary army and a large supply of arms, tricolour [[cockade]]s and [[Phrygian cap|liberty caps]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} They brought F\u00e9don a [[Commission (document)|commission]] for the rank of commandant-general in the French revolutionary army,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}} and instructions to promulgate the revolution through Grenada and then to the rest of the archipelago.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=71}}\n\n===Participants===\nCandlin has estimated that around 12,500 slaves took an active role in the rebellion, or half the island's slave population.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}{{refn|Many others, she notes, \"hedged their bets or took opportunities as they came\", for instance, to escape the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}|group=note}} Although the slaves who revolted were doing so for with the aim of their own emancipation as their primary goal, they appear to have had a longer-term intention of abolishing the system itself.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The French white and freedmen probably only amounted to around 150 individuals, however,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} while the leadership cadre possessed a \"stark diversity of ideas and personalities\" among them.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Many had been business associates of F\u00e9don and his brothers-in-law, or legal witnesses to deeds and charters.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}} Of the rebel army in the field on the rebellion's outbreak, Craton has estimated its size at around 350 who possessed firearms, 250 with pikes or swords, and the remainder awaiting weapons.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\n\nLeaders included F\u00e9don's brother-in-law [[Charles Nogues]]{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[Jean Pierre Lavallee]],{{refn|Ocassionally Lavelette.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=14\u201315}}|group=note}} who were close friends with Victor Hughes; Hughes looked protected Nogues' son while the rebellion was ongoing.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Nogues wasa prominent [[tailor]] on the island,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} and was also Philip's brother-in-law.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Prominent whites included [[Clozier d'Arcuiel]], [[Jean Baptiste Olliviere]] and the [[Chevalier du Suze]] who were important strategists in the military campaign as well as its administration.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} As well as Nogue, leading freed men included [[Stanislaus Besson]], [[Etienne Ventour]]\u2014a \"hothead\", suggests Candlin{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}\u2014and [[Joachim Phillip]],{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} a coloured free [[Coloniser|planter]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} F\u00e9don appears to have come under internal criticism for a having a dictatorial approach.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\n====Leadership====\nF\u00e9don was both [[General]] of the army and head of the revolutionary council, known as the \"Commission of the 24\", which, despite concerns as to his dictatorial attitude, F\u00e9don does seem to have regularly requested advice from.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}{{refn|F\u00e9don may have been related through his mother to [[Henri Christophe]], deputy to the Haitian General L'Ouverture.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=71\u201372}}|group=note}} The leadership element was particularly concentrated in residents of the parishes of [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|St John]] and [[Gouyave]]. F\u00e9don, for example, was from the latter, as were a number of \"prominent whites\" he associated with.{{sfn|Martin|2017|pp=13\u201314}} Much of F\u00e9don's immediate support came from his relatives, either by blood or by marriage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Prominent amongst them was his wife, Marie Rose, whom eyewitnesses later testified to being an \"active and engaging presence\" alongside F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} Another leading figure, [[Joachim Philip]], was, according to Candlin, a \"most interesting man\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} From a large and extremely prosperous family of Grenadian planters, with much standing in the community,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} he felt that he had been repeatedly ignored for office or patronage by the British administration.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}{{refn|His family was also already known to the governor, Home. In 1793 his father Michael had submitted a request to the administration for small arms to defend [[Petite Martinique]]; \"unable to countenance such an idea, in the margin of the request Ninian Home scribbled 'not complied with'\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} The rebellion's leadership, suggests Candlin, was composed of \"tightly knit series of free coloured families who all intermarried\". F\u00e9don's deputy in the rebellion, Besson, was a local [[silversmith]]; Philip was a carpenter. Personally, F\u00e9don was heavily [[mortgage]]d.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n==Outbreak and the first week of operations==\nBy 1 March 1795, Governor home, Candlin argues, was \"increasingly desperate and\naware that something might be afoot\". The [[militia]] was raised, but\u2014in a continuance of the heavy-handed treatment of the island's coloured population\u2014the coloured members of the militia were excluded from the general call to arms. This created further ill-feeling, and may, suggest Candlin, encouraged those members to join, rather than resist, the rebels. Home's actions may have forced F\u00e9don's hand in the timing of the rebellion: \"On an island where distrust and disloyalty were salient features, keeping covert plans secret was impossible\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Governor Home was not in St George's at the time but was on his estate in [[Paraclete, Grenada|Paraclete]] in the northeast of the island. He heard exaggerated rumours that the rebels were already in control of the island, so, believing the roads to be unsafe, he took a [[sloop]] to Gouyave.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\n\n===Massacre at Grenville and Marquis=== \nIn the east, at the small village of Grenville, the insurgents attacked and overran the small towns of Grenville{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} and [[Marquis, Grenada|Marquis]].{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}}{{refn|F\u00e9don later blamed this massacre on a non-existent French Revolutionary army he claimed had invaded.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} about seven miles from Belvidere.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=15, 16}} At midnight F\u00e9don and Besson, leading a group of about 100 freedmen{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}}\u2014some of whom guarded the entrances to the village to prevent anyone escaping\u2014attacked. They forced 20 white residents from their houses and into the market place, where they were all shot and the bodies then cut up with cutlasses. This, says Candlin, was done to \"the cheers of their free coloured neighbours\". Two whites escaped, and the town was looted.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don and his force withdrew with hostages to their headquarters in Belvidere.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} ''En route'', some of these\u2014including an old priest and a [[Piloting (navigation)|pilot]]\u2014were shot dead.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} They also returned to Belvidere, capturing more hostages and gathering more support as they did.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\n===Assault on Gouyave===\nGouyave was on the west coast of the island and was attacked at the same time as Grenville, although with far less violence. This force was led by Philip and Ventour, and included both white French and coloured men. Although there were no deaths in Gouyave, the town was also looted, with houses being ransacked and torched.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} Instead of killing those whites that had not had a chance to escape, Philip and Ventour took them hostage.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}} The leader of the local militia, says Candlin, Dr Hay \"and his family could expect no quarter\", although in the event they were spared. Candlin speculates that this may have been because he and Ventour were neighbours, or perhaps more likely, because of the value a medical doctor was recognised as having to the rebel army.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The [[parson]], McMahon, was also among the captured.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}} The only injury was suffered by Ventour, who shot himself in the wrist while confiscating Hay's pistols. The white men were taken hostage and marched off to Belvidere, while, says Candlin, French coloured women \"enjoyed the scene below from their balconies\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}{{refn|Candlin argues that the relative lack of violence done in Gouyave may have been due to Philip, who, she suggests, had \"more to lose\" than his comrades.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}|group=note}} \n\nSoon after the attackers left Gouyave, Home\u2014not realising that the town was in enemy hands\u2014landed at Gouyave with four others; his longboat was captured before it had even landed, and he and his men were also taken back to Belvidere.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\n\n===Marching on St George's===\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Without entering into any detail of our rights, we summon you, and all the inhabitants, of every denomination in this colony, to surrender, within the space of two hours, to the republican forces under our command...And we give you notice, that in case of your not submitting, as you are enjoined, you shall be liable to all the scourges of a disastrous war ...\nDone at our camp, the fourth of March in the third year of the French Republic, one and indivisible.\nJulien F\u00e9don, Of\ufb01cer of the Republic, appointed at Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Julien F\u00e9don, 4 March 1796|align=right|width=25em}}\n\nBy the morning of 4 March, the rebel army approached St George's. Drumming themselves on, they were heard at a distance; one commentator later wrote{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} how the local [[militia]]\u2014comprising around 150 men{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\u2014declared they would defend their lives, families and properties or die in the attempt. It was, said the observer, \"a chaotic and most melancholy scene\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} A delegation comprising Nogues and Philip demanded access to the gubernatorial council; this was granted,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} although not before Philip and Nogues had to be rescued from an angry mob that included Philip's own sister, who tried to \"tear him to pieces\".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=73}} Informing the council that they had captured \"the tyrant and former governor\",{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}} they made two proclamations. The first\u2014\"chillingly uncompromising\"\u2014was from F\u00e9don, demanding the British surrender. The next speech had been prepared by Victor Huges, emphasising the extent of his victory over the British at Guadaloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Time and the defeat of the English forces at Guadeloupe had weakened the remembrance of the heinous crimes by which the vile satellites of GEORGE had sullied the Windward Islands...that from and after the date of this our of\ufb01cial declaration, the assassination of each and every individual republican (of whatever colour he is; and in whatever island it may happen) shall be expiated by the death of two English of\ufb01cers, our prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Victor Huges to the British council in St George's, 4 March 1796|align=left|width=25em}}\n\nNogues and Philip were fed and watered by the British\u2014which \"they calmly enjoyed\"\u2014while the latter went into consultation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} Outside, meanwhile, the rest of the gang that had accompanied them was becoming increasingly fractious and was being continually augmented by supporters in St George's. The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Home, and many other hostages, were kept tied to a [[Buccan|boucan frame]] for drying coffee.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy to the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} They also declared that any assault on their Belvidere base would result in the deaths of the hostages.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The British issued a proclamation announcing an amnesty to all rebels who surrendered peaceably and returned to their duties. They also promised an \"incredible\" reward of {{Inflation|UK|40|1795|fmt=c}} for the capture\u2014[[dead or alive]]\u2014of any rebel.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}{{refn|Craton argues this was bound to be of little effect, as \"the republican offer of freedom was much more attractive to the Grenadian slaves than the mere promise of an amnesty made by the regime\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}|group=note}} McKenzie wrote to London demanding reinforcements, emphasising the precarious nature of British rule following the rebellion:\n\n{{blockquote|text=Every moment of inactivity must increase the evil within, as the Negroes are daily joining the Insurgents and desolating the Estates; all of which have been plundered, and a number in the neighbourhood of St George's...have been burnt\".{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}}}\n\nBrigadier-General Sir Colin Lyndsay was despatched to Grenada with 150 regular soldiers from Martinique,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}} as was a force comprising reinforcements from [[Barbados]] and the sailors and marines from a passing British [[frigate]]. Also present were a number of Spanish soldiers sent by the governor of [[Trinidad]] in sympathy.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|Around the same time, the Spanish also helped the British administration in Jamaica suppress the [[Second Maroon War|Trelawny Maroons]] with [[hunting dog]]s.{{sfn|Geggus|1997|p=21}}|group=note}}\n\n==Course of the rebellion==\nThe rebels received further assistance from Hughes, in the form of armed squadrons, which had sufficient success to establish an administrative ''[[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partment]]'' under the rebels' direct control.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\nThe rebellion, argues Martin, \"raged for 15 months, and saw extreme brutality and destruction\" take place.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Many of the white French rebels surrendered to the British as the rebellion increased in ferocity; they may have felt more endangered from the rebels than from the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Most British planters deserted their estates for the towns, leaving both them and any faithful slaves at the mercy of the rebels.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}} The British Army sustained continual losses, and the Chief Surgeon, called McGrigor, recorded \"frightful\" losses.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=26}} \n\nAlthough the rebels massively outnumbered the British, F\u00e9don's side lacked the experienced tacticians and strategists possessed by the British, and their assaults\u2014while large-scale and brutal\u2014were disorganised.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although controlled most of the countryside, F\u00e9don's army was unable to displace the British from St George's, while the latter also had the advantage of [[Royal Navy|superior sea power]]. This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Meanwhile, Lyndsay marched inland and attacked the Belvidere estate. He was able to capture F\u00e9don's house on 17 March after savage fighting, but then discovered that the main rebel camp was situated further up the hill.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area. The mortality rate in British garrisons in [[Jamaica]] was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.{{sfn|McNeill|2002|pp=10\u201316}} Between the years 1791 and 1797, across the entire [[archipelago]], the army lost an average of 700 me a month to the febver; this was its worst losses in its history.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=26}}|group=note}} In April, a British [[Brigadier-General]], [[Colin Lindsay]], was so distraught with the fever that he left his camp, went out into the rain, and shot himself;{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} although notes Craton, his position was worsened by \"the nightmare of heat and mosquitoes, barbarous shouts and sudden volleys from hidden assailants\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}}\n\nLittle activity from either side is known of between the initial rebel attacks and May 1795; the rebels may have spent their time consolidating the defences at Belvidere; Philip's brother was a trained [[Stone mason|mason]], notes Candlin, and this would have been a particularly useful skill in this regard.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=17\u201318}} The rebels were still disorganised, so intensive training was probably undertaken, while the presence of a large number of women and children made it necessary for them to be looked after.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} The British limited their actions to circulating bills around the anglophone community urging them to remember their duty as subjects of [[George III]], while calling on the French-speaking populace to return to the fold.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} In March, a small but decisive engagement was fought at Madame Ach\u00e9's plantation on Grand Etang, with the victory going to the rebels, while the British were also unable to clear them from Pilot Hill.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}}\n\n===Attack on Belvidere===\nIn May 1795, the British launched a surprise night-attack on F\u00e9don's Belvidere base. The army's commander, Lindsay, had killed himself, so the command fell to his inexperienced subordinate, Colonel Schaw. The British troops, in particular, were weakened by sickness, and this lost them the element of surprise they had relied on for victory.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|They were not always weak with sickness; before the assault on Belvidere was finally launched, the attack had already been cancelled twice through the troops getting plastered on good [[rum]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}|group=note}} \n\nAs the Belvidere Estate was situated on elevated ground, the British were at a severe tactical disadvantage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} Further, the rebels had spent the preceding weeks fortifying it with a number of levels of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}{{refn|The defences were good enough that, later on, British officers assumed that they had to have been a long time in the preparation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}|group=note}} The outer layer of defence\u2014known as ''Fraternit\u00e9''\u2014held the majority of the rebel army, including artillery{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}\u2014which due to a lack of cannonballs, were loaded with sugar wedges wrapped in sacking{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}\u2014behind a complex of [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} These consisted of [[Defile (geography)|defiles]] intended to lure the British into ambush.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}} Above that was ''Libert\u00e9'', which contained the estate buildings itself and the rebel headquarters. The third and last camp\u2014''Morte''\u2014was by way of being a redoubt at the last line of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} \n\nIn torrential rain,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}} the British attacked from several directions simultaneously, supported by both cannon and cavalry.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} After intense [[hand-to-hand combat]], the British army got to the gates of ''Morte'' [[redoubt]].{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} Dr Hay was responsible for the rebels' medical station in ''Libert\u00e9''.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=7, 17}} F\u00e9don's brother, Jean, was killed in the intense fighting.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} and F\u00e9don later suggested that no [[No quarter|quarter]] was given the rebels. The attack, however, had dissipated by morning. The failure was the result, says Candlin, of \"poor coordination, coupled with bad weather and mere bad luck\";{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} Jacobs describes the operation as \"bungled\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} The British lost 27 men dead and 57 wounded.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}\n\n====Murder of the hostages====\nIn retaliation for the attack on Belvidere\u2014and perhaps indicating how close it had come to victory{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}\u2014F\u00e9don had the 44 of his 47 hostages killed: \"one by one\", comments Candlin, \"the prisoners were dragged from the coffee store into the estate courtyard and shot, their blood mingling with the muddy, rain-soaked ground and running in great streams off the hillside\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=8, 18}}{{refn|Joachim Philip's brother Nicholas had been responsible for guarding the prisoners, and he was also in charge of their execution, including the provision of a [[coup de grace]] when necessary.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} This number included the island's governor, Ninian Home, upon whose killing Marie Rose F\u00e9don observed with a \"cold indifference\", as Dr Hay later wrote.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} Among those whom Fr\u00e9don allowed to live was the \"much-loved\" Parson McMahon\u2014who, Candlin suggests may have been known to F\u00e9don\u2014a Dr Hay, and a fellow named Kerr. Dr Hay was spared because, as a medical doctor, his skills would come in handy to the rebels;{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} it is also probable, suggest Candlin and Pybus, that this was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for his generous treatment of Marie Rose following her arrest.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=23\u201324}} Who Kerr was, or why he was spared, is unknown, but in his memoirs, Dr Hay asserted that Kerr was probably a rebel spy among the hostages.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n===Haitus===\nThe assault on Belvidere and the killings of the hostages was followed, comments Candlin, by a \"bizarre year-long standoff\". On F\u00e9don's part, this was because he had neither the troops nor the resources to maintain an army in the field for any length of time,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} although he was joined by a number of English-speaking slaves from British estates.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Neither, for that matter, did the British; but they were waiting for the men and supplies that were gradually reached them by sea.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} McKenzie continued to fortify St George's until it was almost as formidable a port as [[English Harbour]] in Antigua.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} He decided to conserve his forces and retreat to urban areas and forts,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} but by doing so, suggests Walvin, allowed F\u00e9don had effectively created a \"state within a state\".{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}} For most of the rest of the year, F\u00e9don relied on [[guerilla tactics]], so avoiding pitched battles. Towards the end of the year, the arrival of further French supplies enabled the rebels to launch an island-wide offensive. He drove the white militia out of Gouyave (capturing a unit of Loyal Black rangers in doing so) and overran Grenville again, this time establishing [[Artillery battery|batteries]] with which to bombard the patrolling British ships. Then in February 1796, the rebels captured Mount St Eloi, to the north of St George's.{{sfn|Craton|2009|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nThe failure of the attack on St George's meant that the British remained in control of the most important strategic site on the island, and to where they could be regularly revictualled. F\u00e9don, meanwhile, remained in command of most of the island. His army needed feeding, but he had no effective strategy for this and mainly relied on hand-to-mouth pillaging of by now-deserted estates. Although originally a rich vein of succour, these estates\u2014by now producing nothing due to the war\u2014were gradually becoming less and less profitable for the rebels. This was reflected generally: says Candlin, \"the island's produce was destroyed,\nthere were no crops and the economy completely collapsed\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nDuring their occupation of Gouyave by the rebels\u2014who made it their capital\u2014the town was renamed {{lang-fr|Port Libre}} (Free Port), from where a rudimentary government was established. Among other enactments, slavery was abolished and allegiance to the [[French Republic]] was declared.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} F\u00e9don appears to have managed to create a fledgeling bureaucracy during this period of relative calm.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=189}} \n\nFollowing the suicide of Lindsay, he was replaced by Brigadier-General [[Oliver Nicolls]] who brought 1,000 men and over-ran Pilot Hill in early May. At the same time, [[HMS Mermaid (1784)|HMS Mermaid]] captured two French ships and the 250 marines on board.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} However, Yellow Fever continued to ravage the British Army, which by summer 1795 had lost two-thirds of its regulars to the disease; further, large numbers of the white militia also deserted. By the start of 1796 Craton has estimated that the militia stood at 281 active men (when it had been 535 the same time the previous year). There was some good news for McKenzie; the creation of a Loyal Black Ranger Corp had proved popular as an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] force and now comprised 5 [[companies]] of 60 men and 25 officers.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}{{refn|Craton argues that \"ironically, without these faithful black auxiliaries, who...already outnumbered the rest of the militia, Grenada would have fallen entirely to F\u00e9don's forces\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}|group=note}}  \n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Hugues, in Guadeloupe, was particularly vociferous in spurring the F\u00e9dons on in Grenada, but found he had little sway over F\u00e9don, whom he called hot-headed.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=26, 72}} F\u00e9don, though, increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades elsewhere to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} F\u00e9don and Philip both had siblings who had emigrated to Trinidad prior to the rebellion and it is probable that they also provided external support for the rebels.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} \n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces succeeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}{{refn|Which they managed to do, says Candlin, despite having no small ships available to patrol the sea. However, there were sufficient [[ships of the line]] in the area to ensure an effective blockade of Grenada,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} as the Royal Navy had maintained a presence in the Caribbean since the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}|group=note}} Hugues appears to have distanced himself from Fr\u00e9don after the latter began executing his prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=72}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Nonetheless, as a result of the disagreements between F\u00e9don and Hugues, the rebellion effectively split into two parties. The French Republicans were based at Belvidere, while the Grenadians operated out of Gouyave.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} \n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nIn March 1796 Nicolls launched an assault on the Grenville-Marquis area. The rebels were forced to fight and were eventually expelled from the area having lost around 300 men. F\u00e9don was himself wounded and his force retired to the mountains surrounding Grand Etang and Belvidere.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}}  \n\nIn the meantime, Britain had been organising an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] under [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] to take back the island. Although \"long overdue\",{{refn|Abercromby had been appointed in June 1795.{{sfn|Divall|2019|pp=72\u201373}}|group=note}} suggests Candlin, it arrived in June 1796.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} Abercromby was a highly experienced editor{{refn|A strong supporter of the [[American Revolution]], he had buggered about in Ireland in order to avoid being sent to fight there for Britain. When war with France broke out in 1793, however, he was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}|group=note}} and now outnumbered the rebels by about 10 to 1.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}}\n\nCandlin estimates that it took only a fortnight to [[rout]] F\u00e9don's rebel army and regain the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} The French republican force in Gouyave under Captain [[Josse de Tournecy]]{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}} surrendered on 10 June 1796.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Abercromby, leading the [[57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot|57th Regiment of Foot]] approached F\u00e9don's base from the west, launching his attack from the Grand Roy Valley. Stealth units, composed of a number of ''[[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|J\u00e4gers]]'' approached the Belvidere encampment from the north.  In a number of assaults, the attackers suffered 65 casualties, but on 9 June they breached the third of F\u00e9don's hillside redoubts with little resistance.{{sfn|Craton|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} Marie Rose F\u00e9don was probably killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=29}} while F\u00e9don killed the last remaining prisoners\u2014thus strengthening inordinately the British desire to hunt him down, comments Craton\u2014and escaped. F\u00e9don was never seen again, notes Craton, and suggests that it was from this point that he and those with him were transformed from \"revolutionary soldiers into legendary outlaws\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=208}}{{refn|F\u00e9don's hide-out was sparse.

A British official later recorded that, on the last such occasion, F\u00e9don launched himself \"down a place where [no man] dare venture after him. His object and that of the few remaining in the woods was to get off in a canoe. We have...destroyed several that were preparing for that purpose\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Even so, notes Walvin, it took the British another 18 months to restore order completely.{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}\n\n==Consequences==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, a [[Bill of attainder]] was promulgated which condemned 400 people.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Two hundred rebels were enslaved{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and 50 executed,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} suffering hanging followed by decapitation.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Slaves who were captured had generally been [[Summary execution|hanged where they had been found]]; free coloureds and whites were taken to the towns, where, after a \"nominal\" trail, suggests Craton, they were publicly executed and their heads paraded through St George's and other towns.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=208}} Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt.

However, the Spanish government disallowed an investigation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Candlin inclines to the theory that\u2014\"Given the interconnectedness of relatives in Trinidad and Grenada\"\u2014it is most likely that he survived and went into hiding in the former,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} while Jacob suggests that he escaped to Cuba.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Wherever he was, suggests Craton, he was presumably \"living incognito and waiting for his chance to return and lead the ultimate rebellion\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=210}}\n\nPhilip, on the other hand, stayed in Grenada, successfully hiding from the authorities for eight years\u2014possibly as a \"maroon\" in the forest, suggested an official report\u2014when he was discovered on Petite Martinique in March 1803 and hanged St George's market place a few days later.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}}{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=73}} Candlin notes that, while those directly involved could not expect to receive mercy\u2014and did not\u2014those who managed to \"managed to keep a low pro\ufb01le away from the violence and at relative peace with their neighbours fared better\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe rebellion was defined as [[high treason]] rather than merely criminal (as it would be if deemed [[conspiracy]] or [[sedition]]).{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=209}} Rather than the usual courts of law, those suspected of complicity on the rebellion were examined under commissions of [[oyer and terminer]] which had the power to impose arbitrary sentences and confiscate property.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=209}}{{refn|This particular judicial implement was also useful because it did not require witnesses to be called; the only two responses to the charge a defendant was allowed to make was either to plead guilty or to state that they were not the named individual.

The con\ufb02ict had cleared the way for a widespread [[Anglicanization]] of the island and a dramatic increase in colonial power.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=35\u201336}}}}\n\nThe rebellion was one of what Candlin and Pybus call \"several interconnected struggles that tore through the Caribbean\" in the [[Age of Revolution]].{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=24}} It directly influenced the [[Second Carib War|revolt in St Vincent]] in 1796, in which rebels held the country for six months before being crushed by Abercromby.{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=144}}{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=211}}{{refn|Although Craton argues that the Maroon War, although much smaller than F\u00e9don's rebellion{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=209}}{{blockquote|text=\"has always been more famous...not just because it occurred in Jamaica, the chief of Britain's sugar colonies, but because it had the lineaments of a classic tale: a desperate cause, a heroic fight against odds, and a tragic outcome deeply discreditable to the winning side\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=211}}}}|group=note}}  Although by 1797, suggests Craton \"Grenada was superficially peaceful, but the effects of F\u00e9don's rebellion were never fully mended\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=209}} \n\n==Historiography==\n===Sourcing===\nThe main sources for scholars of F\u00e9don's Rebellion are original documents, mostly held at the [[National Archives (UK)|the National Archives]] in [[Kew]], and a number of contemporary books. These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} They were written by Dr Hay and the Parson, Francis McMahon, who had been captured at Grenville and Marquis; both published their accounts in 1823.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the major slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}} The majority of contemporary sources view it solely as the work of \"French revolutionary agents, traitorous francophone residents, or free persons of African descent whose liberty threatened the colonial order\", argues the scholar Caitlin Anderson. This\u2014and the fact that they are \"marked by profound silences\"\u2014makes the sources inadequate to know the fundamentals a historian wants to know: who planned it, why and what they wished to replace it with.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=202}} Anderson also notes that this is at least in part due to the nature of the subsequent trials and investigations. Because courts of oyer and terminer required neither witnesses nor defence, there is nothing in writing confirming or denying either the accusations nor the responses, only lists of names, convictions and sentence.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=209}}\n\n===Analysis===\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The participants probably viewed the rebellion differently from the beginning, the French and free coloureds seeing themselves as anti-colonialists, while the slaves seeing as a traditional [[Slave rebellion|slave rebelion]].{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=165}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} The salves were not just armed by the rebels: \"all sides, royalist and republican, French and British, armed slaves in droves\".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=25}} F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues Jacobs, \"defies categorization\",{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} while the historian James Walvin has highlighted the particular problems that hybrid revolts such as F\u00e9don's caused the government:{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=What puzzled the worried planters, however, was that the slave leaders were local-born. As long as the rebels were Africans, slave-owners had no trouble explaining revolt in terms of African barbarism. But who could explain the rebellious instinct in local-born slaves?{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}}}\n\nAnother problem the aftermath of the rebellion raised for the administration, argues Anderson, was the treatment of the slaves. While there was no compunction in meting the highest penalties of treason to them, there was an awareness that this, therefore, implied them to be British subjects\u2014\"with all the rights and privileges of that status\".{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=210}} As such, there appears to have been an unspoken agreement not to summon any slaves before the oyer and terminer courts nor to convict them, as doing so would confer rights upon them that were incommensurate with their slave status.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=211}}{{refn|Anderson notes that one slave was caught and condemned for high treason in the first week of the rebellion, but also that he was the only one to be so treated.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=211}}|group=note}} Writing in ''The Encyclopedia of Africa and the Americas'', C. M. Jacobs has described the revolt as \"one of the most spectacular, sustained, bloody but ultimately unsuccessful antislavery, anticolonial, proto-nationalist struggles of the Age of Revolution\",{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} although the extent of the bloodshed has been contested. Craton suggests that, in fact, off the battlefield, F\u00e9don's regime \"appears (the details are sketchy) to have been far from the destructive and bloody anarchy pictured by the beleaguered whites\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=189}} \n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} The rebellion has been seen as one of the most significant events in the region's history. The author Michael Craton, for example, has described it as \"the most serious threat posed to British control anywhere in the Antilles\",{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=165}} and it is often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance. Many Grenadians, suggests Martin, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}\n\nThere were as much personal as political motivations for the rebellion; the F\u00e9dons, for example, \"used the con\ufb02ict to try and gain more power for themselves as white rule fractured around them\", {{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=24}} while his Lieutenant, Philip, was in debt by \u00a32,260 and had had to sell off much of his property in the years prior to the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=73}} As did much of the slave community, which often took freedom for itself without actuvely joining the revolt.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=24}} Although the slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n===Reasons for failure===\nCandlin emphasises that too little planning was to blame for the eventual failure of the rebellion, particularly regarding supplies and materiel. F\u00e9don had not planned for an eventuality in which he began running out of either, and was, therefore, surprised when this occurred. Further, too much of the island's productive machinery had been destroyed in the early weeks of the uprising without a long-term plan or ability to replace it. F\u00e9don relied on reinforcements that never materialised.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Memorials and cultural impact==\nThe 19th-century Trinidadian novelist [[Edward Lanzer Joseph]]'s ''[[Warner Arundell: The Adventures of a Creole|Warner Arundell]]'', published in 1838, is a historical register of the period in which F\u00e9don is a primary protagonist,{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} a brooding [[Byronic hero]] much favoured by [[Gothic literature]] at the time.{{sfn|Amadori|2014|p=260}} Its characters include many other historical figures of the era, apart from F\u00e9don, such as Ralph Woodford, Victor Hugues and [[Simon Bolivar]].{{sfn|Amadori|2014|p=248 n.133}} A contemporary reviewer for ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' noted that, although \"by the pen of its author, it is evidently founded on a basis of fact\".{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} In Joseph's story, F\u00e9don has survived the rebellion, and while roaming as a criminal in exile, he is haunted by a sense of failure.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Jacob has described F\u00e9don as \"a legend and inspiration to Grenada's artists, nationalists, and revolutionaries\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Craton explains F\u00e9don's popular memorialisation as stemming from \"the uncertainty of his fate, for he thereby became a permanent symbol, a mythical hero for political revolutionaries and less politically motivated freedom-loving blacks alike\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=210}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite thesis|last=Amadori|first=C.|title=Shape-Shifting Creole Identities: Representations of Creole Figures in Nineteenth-Century Anglophone Transatlantic Literature|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Miami|oclc=638691892}}\n* {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=C.|editor-last1=Bessel|editor-first1=R.|editor-last2=Guyatt|editor-first2=N.|editor-last3=Rendall|editor-first3=J.|title=War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-23028-269-8|location=London|page=210\u2013217|chapter=Old Subjects, New Subjects and Non-Subjects: Silences and Subjecthood in F\u00e9don\u2019s Rebellion, Grenada, 1795\u201396}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.

Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} From this point on, argue Candlin and Pybus, \"the British reoccupied Grenada with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to send a clear message of racial superiority and religious intolerance\".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=22}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} In the early days of the revolution, French planters appear to have remained resistant to the revolution's call to violence; in August 1790 for example, F\u00e9don himself signed a petition against growing radicalism on the island, which claimed that both French and English planters were at risk.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \"found cowering in their plantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nAt the time of the rebellion, Grenada had a population of approximately 1,125 free coloured\nresidents\u2014including 940 French free coloureds\u2014and 185 British citizens.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman|free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}} The long term origin of the revolt, argues Jacobs, was \"more than a century of slave resistance and also in French discontent over British rule\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} \n\nBritish ([[Protestant]]){{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} especially against the French\u2014Catholic{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\u2014inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The [[French language]] had been all but eradicated officially, and vestiges of [[French law]] also.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=183}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}{{refn|Britain's harsh treatment of the Grenadans, suggest Candlin, can be compared to that of the Spanish who \"showed a particularly lenient attitude to people of mixed race\" and encouraged emigration to their [[Trinidad]] lands.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}|group=note}} The large number of French coloureds worried the British, who, says Candlin \"regarded them first with deep suspicion then actively\ntried to oppress them through legislation, each law underscoring further the inherent dif\ufb01culty members of the white community had at distinguishing friend from foe\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}{{refn|Legislation included restrictions on the holding of unregulated ceremonies, coloureds being forbidden to walk at night without a lantern to light them, a [[curfew]] and weapons restrictions.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} On one occasion, F\u00e9don's wife had been arrested for breaching a restriction and had been imprisoned for some weeks before he could secure her release.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} Marie-Rose F\u00e9don had been unable to prove she was a free woman under a ruling enacted the previous year.

The [[militia]] was raised, but\u2014in a continuance of the heavy-handed treatment of the island's coloured population\u2014the coloured members of the militia were excluded from the general call to arms. This created further ill-feeling, and may, suggest Candlin, encouraged those members to join, rather than resist, the rebels. Home's actions may have forced F\u00e9don's hand in the timing of the rebellion: \"On an island where distrust and disloyalty were salient features, keeping covert plans secret was impossible\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Governor Home was not in St George's at the time but was on his estate in [[Paraclete, Grenada|Paraclete]] in the northeast of the island.

This force was led by Philip and Ventour, and included both white French and coloured men. Although there were no deaths in Gouyave, the town was also looted, with houses being ransacked and torched.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} Instead of killing those whites that had not had a chance to escape, Philip and Ventour took them hostage.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}} The leader of the local militia, says Candlin, Dr Hay \"and his family could expect no quarter\", although in the event they were spared. Candlin speculates that this may have been because he and Ventour were neighbours, or perhaps more likely, because of the value a medical doctor was recognised as having to the rebel army.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The [[parson]], McMahon, was also among the captured.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=185}} The only injury was suffered by Ventour, who shot himself in the wrist while confiscating Hay's pistols.

The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Home, and many other hostages, were kept tied to a [[Buccan|boucan frame]] for drying coffee.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy to the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} They also declared that any assault on their Belvidere base would result in the deaths of the hostages.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}\n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The British issued a proclamation announcing an amnesty to all rebels who surrendered peaceably and returned to their duties.

This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Meanwhile, Lyndsay marched inland and attacked the Belvidere estate. He was able to capture F\u00e9don's house on 17 March after savage fighting, but then discovered that the main rebel camp was situated further up the hill.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=187}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area.

Dr Hay was spared because, as a medical doctor, his skills would come in handy to the rebels;{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} it is also probable, suggest Candlin and Pybus, that this was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for his generous treatment of Marie Rose following her arrest.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=23\u201324}} Who Kerr was, or why he was spared, is unknown, but in his memoirs, Dr Hay asserted that Kerr was probably a rebel spy among the hostages.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n===Haitus===\nThe assault on Belvidere and the killings of the hostages was followed, comments Candlin, by a \"bizarre year-long standoff\". On F\u00e9don's part, this was because he had neither the troops nor the resources to maintain an army in the field for any length of time,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} although he was joined by a number of English-speaking slaves from British estates.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Neither, for that matter, did the British; but they were waiting for the men and supplies that were gradually reached them by sea.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} McKenzie continued to fortify St George's until it was almost as formidable a port as [[English Harbour]] in Antigua.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} He decided to conserve his forces and retreat to urban areas and forts,{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} but by doing so, suggests Walvin, allowed F\u00e9don had effectively created a \"state within a state\".{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}} For most of the rest of the year, F\u00e9don relied on [[guerilla tactics]], so avoiding pitched battles. Towards the end of the year, the arrival of further French supplies enabled the rebels to launch an island-wide offensive. He drove the white militia out of Gouyave (capturing a unit of Loyal Black rangers in doing so) and overran Grenville again, this time establishing [[Artillery battery|batteries]] with which to bombard the patrolling British ships. Then in February 1796, the rebels captured Mount St Eloi, to the north of St George's.{{sfn|Craton|2009|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nThe failure of the attack on St George's meant that the British remained in control of the most important strategic site on the island, and to where they could be regularly revictualled. F\u00e9don, meanwhile, remained in command of most of the island. His army needed feeding, but he had no effective strategy for this and mainly relied on hand-to-mouth pillaging of by now-deserted estates. Although originally a rich vein of succour, these estates\u2014by now producing nothing due to the war\u2014were gradually becoming less and less profitable for the rebels. This was reflected generally: says Candlin, \"the island's produce was destroyed,\nthere were no crops and the economy completely collapsed\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nDuring their occupation of Gouyave by the rebels\u2014who made it their capital\u2014the town was renamed {{lang-fr|Port Libre}} (Free Port), from where a rudimentary government was established. Among other enactments, slavery was abolished and allegiance to the [[French Republic]] was declared.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} F\u00e9don appears to have managed to create a fledgeling bureaucracy during this period of relative calm.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=189}} \n\nFollowing the suicide of Lindsay, he was replaced by Brigadier-General [[Oliver Nicolls]] who brought 1,000 men and over-ran Pilot Hill in early May. At the same time, [[HMS Mermaid (1784)|HMS Mermaid]] captured two French ships and the 250 marines on board.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}} However, Yellow Fever continued to ravage the British Army, which by summer 1795 had lost two-thirds of its regulars to the disease; further, large numbers of the white militia also deserted. By the start of 1796 Craton has estimated that the militia stood at 281 active men (when it had been 535 the same time the previous year). There was some good news for McKenzie; the creation of a Loyal Black Ranger Corp had proved popular as an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] force and now comprised 5 [[companies]] of 60 men and 25 officers.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}{{refn|Craton argues that \"ironically, without these faithful black auxiliaries, who...already outnumbered the rest of the militia, Grenada would have fallen entirely to F\u00e9don's forces\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=188}}|group=note}}  \n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Hugues, in Guadeloupe, was particularly vociferous in spurring the F\u00e9dons on in Grenada, but found he had little sway over F\u00e9don, whom he called hot-headed.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=26, 72}} F\u00e9don, though, increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades elsewhere to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} F\u00e9don and Philip both had siblings who had emigrated to Trinidad prior to the rebellion and it is probable that they also provided external support for the rebels.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} \n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces succeeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}{{refn|Which they managed to do, says Candlin, despite having no small ships available to patrol the sea. However, there were sufficient [[ships of the line]] in the area to ensure an effective blockade of Grenada,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} as the Royal Navy had maintained a presence in the Caribbean since the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}|group=note}} Hugues appears to have distanced himself from Fr\u00e9don after the latter began executing his prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=72}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Nonetheless, as a result of the disagreements between F\u00e9don and Hugues, the rebellion effectively split into two parties. The French Republicans were based at Belvidere, while the Grenadians operated out of Gouyave.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} \n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nIn March 1796 Nicolls launched an assault on the Grenville-Marquis area. The rebels were forced to fight and were eventually expelled from the area having lost around 300 men. F\u00e9don was himself wounded and his force retired to the mountains surrounding Grand Etang and Belvidere.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}}  \n\nIn the meantime, Britain had been organising an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] under [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] to take back the island. Although \"long overdue\",{{refn|Abercromby had been appointed in June 1795.{{sfn|Divall|2019|pp=72\u201373}}|group=note}} suggests Candlin, it arrived in June 1796.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} Abercromby was a highly experienced editor{{refn|A strong supporter of the [[American Revolution]], he had buggered about in Ireland in order to avoid being sent to fight there for Britain. When war with France broke out in 1793, however, he was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}|group=note}} and now outnumbered the rebels by about 10 to 1.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}}\n\nCandlin estimates that it took only a fortnight to [[rout]] F\u00e9don's rebel army and regain the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} The French republican force in Gouyave under Captain [[Josse de Tournecy]]{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=207}} surrendered on 10 June 1796.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Abercromby, leading the [[57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot|57th Regiment of Foot]] approached F\u00e9don's base from the west, launching his attack from the Grand Roy Valley. Stealth units, composed of a number of ''[[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|J\u00e4gers]]'' approached the Belvidere encampment from the north.  In a number of assaults, the attackers suffered 65 casualties, but on 9 June they breached the third of F\u00e9don's hillside redoubts with little resistance.{{sfn|Craton|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} Marie Rose F\u00e9don was probably killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=29}} while F\u00e9don killed the last remaining prisoners\u2014thus strengthening inordinately the British desire to hunt him down, comments Craton\u2014and escaped. F\u00e9don was never seen again, notes Craton, and suggests that it was from this point that he and those with him were transformed from \"revolutionary soldiers into legendary outlaws\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=208}}{{refn|F\u00e9don's hide-out was sparse.

A British official later recorded that, on on the last such occasion, F\u00e9don launched himself \"down a place where [no man] dare venture after him. His object and that of the few remaining in the woods was to get off in a canoe. We have...destroyed several that were preparing for that purpose\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Even so, notes Walvin, it took the British another 18 months to restore order completely.{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}\n\n==Consequences==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, a [[Bill of attainder]] was promulgated which condemned 400 people.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Two hundred rebels were enslaved{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and 50 executed,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} suffering hanging followed by decapitation.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Slaves who were captured had generally been [[Summary execution|hanged where they had been found]]; free coloureds and whites were taken to the towns, where, after a \"nominal\" trail, suggests Craton, they were publicly executed and their heads paraded through St George's and other towns.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=208}} Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt. Another 500\u2014charged with being in possession of arms\u2014were sold off the island.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Bills were issued requesting slave owners to report the names and numbers of their runaway or missing slaves, and appointed commissioners to establish compensation and oversee the sale of the rebel leaders' estates to that purpose.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=2008}}{{refn|Grenada's demographics took only a few years to recalibrate, and by 1829 the were 3,786 free coloureds compared to 801 whites.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=30}}|group=note}}\n\nF\u00e9don's fate is unknown, comments Candlin, \"only a compass in an upturned rowboat tantalizing\" scholars as to his end. The fact that the boat was pointing towards Trinidad when it was found suggested to contemporaries that he had drowned attempting to join his sister there.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} The Spanish administration of Trinidad was so disorganised, say Candlin and Pybus, that this would not have been as difficult as it may seem.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=29}} On the other hand, a report as late as 1815, from [[Ralph James Woodford|Sir Ralph Woodford]], Governor of Trinidad, that F\u00e9don had been recently sighted in [[Cuba]]. However, the Spanish government disallowed an investigation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Candlin inclines to the theory that\u2014\"Given the interconnectedness of relatives in Trinidad and Grenada\"\u2014it is most likely that he survived and went into hiding in the former,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} while Jacob suggests that he escaped to Cuba.{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Wherever he was, suggests Craton, he was presumably \"living incognito and waiting for his chance to return and lead the ultimate rebellion\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=210}}\n\nPhilip, on the other hand, stayed in Grenada, successfully hiding from the authorities for eight years\u2014possibly as a \"maroon\" in the forest, suggested an official report\u2014when he was discovered on Petite Martinique in March 1803 and hanged St George's market place a few days later.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}}{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=73}} Candlin notes that, while those directly involved could not expect to receive mercy\u2014and did not\u2014those who managed to \"managed to keep a low pro\ufb01le away from the violence and at relative peace with their neighbours fared better\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe rebellion was defined as [[high treason]] rather than merely criminal (as it would be if deemed [[conspiracy]] or [[sedition]]).{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=209}} Rather than the usual courts of law, those suspected of complicity on the rebellion were examined under commissions of [[oyer and terminer]] which had the power to impose arbitrary sentences and confiscate property.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=209}}{{refn|This particular judicial implement was also useful because it did not require witnesses to be called; the only two responses to the charge a defendant was allowed to make was either to plead guilty or to state that they were not the named individual.

Martin suggests that the most likely immediate result would have been\u2014mirroring Haiti\u2014the abolishing of slavery.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} However, argues Craton, while many big houses and their estates had been destroyed, F\u00e9don and the other planter leaders of the rebellion managed to keep their own lands safe and appear to have intended a return to the plantation economy once the British had been finally evicted.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=189}} \n\nGoyrand, in St Lucia, put the failing of the rebellion down to the rebels' lack of unity. In a later letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand told him that{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We had predicted, citizen, you are divided, you were overcome, thus re-join that love of the Republic to replace your ambitious desires.

This compares to Grenada's pre-rebellion position as producing the British Caribbean's send-largest annual income of {{Inflation|UK|450000|1795|fmt=c}}, which the rebellion wiped out.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=35}} Candlin summarises the after-effects of the rebellion thus:\n\n{{blockquote|text=The Royal Navy now patrolled the coastline in force.

These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} They were written by Dr Hay and the Parson, Francis McMahon, who had been captured at Grenville and Marquis; both published their accounts in 1823.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the major slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}} The majority of contemporary sources view it solely as the work of \"French revolutionary agents, traitorous francophone residents, or free persons of African descent whose liberty threatened the colonial order\", argues the scholar Caitlin Anderson. This\u2014and the fact that they are \"marked by profound silences\"\u2014makes the sources inadequate to know the fundamentals a historian wants to know: who planned it, why and what they wished to replace it with.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=202}} Anderson also notes that this is at least in part due to the nature of the subsequent trials and investigations. Because courts of oyer and terminer required neither witnesses nor defence, there is nothing in writing confirming or denying either the accusations nor the responses, only lists of names, convictions and sentence.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=209}}\n\n===Analysis===\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} The participants probably viewed the rebellion differently from the beginning, the French and free coloureds seeing themselves as anti-colonialists, while the slaves seeing as a traditional [[Slave rebellion|slave rebelion]].{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=165}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} The salves were not just armed by the rebels: \"all sides, royalist and republican, French and British, armed slaves in droves\".{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=25}} F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues Jacobs, \"defies categorization\",{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} while the historian James Walvin has highlighted the particular problems that hybrid revolts such as F\u00e9don's caused the government:{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=What puzzled the worried planters, however, was that the slave leaders were local-born. As long as the rebels were Africans, slave-owners had no trouble explaining revolt in terms of African barbarism. But who could explain the rebellious instinct in local-born slaves?{{sfn|Walvin|1994|p=273}}}}\n\nAnother problem the aftermath of the rebellion raised for the administration, argues Anderson, was the treatment of the slaves. While there was no compunction in meting the highest penalties of treason to them, there was an awareness that this, therefore, implied them to be British subjects\u2014\"with all the rights and privileges of that status\".{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=210}} As such, there appears to have been an unspoken agreement not to summon any slaves before the oyer and terminer courts nor to convict them, as doing so would confer rights upon them that were incommensurate with their slave status.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=211}}{{refn|Anderson notes that one slave was caught and condemned for high treason in the first week of the rebellion, but also that he was the only one to be so treated.{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=211}}|group=note}} Writing in ''The Encyclopedia of Africa and the Americas'', C. M. Jacobs has described the revolt as \"one of the most spectacular, sustained, bloody but ultimately unsuccessful antislavery, anticolonial, proto-nationalist struggles of the Age of Revolution\",{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=448}} although the extent of the bloodshed has been contested. Craton suggests that, in fact, off the battlefield, F\u00e9don's regime \"appears (the details are sketchy) to have been far from the destructive and bloody anarchy pictured by the beleaguered whites\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=189}} \n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} The rebellion has been seen as one of the most significant events in the region's history. The author Michael Craton, for example, has described it as \"the most serious threat posed to British control anywhere in the Antilles\",{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=165}} and it is often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance. Many Grenadians, suggests Martin, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}\n\nThere were as much personal as political motivations for the rebellion; the F\u00e9dons, for example, \"used the con\ufb02ict to try and gain more power for themselves as white rule fractured around them\", {{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=24}} while his Lieutenant, Philip, was in debt by \u00a32,260 and had had to sell off much of his property in the years prior to the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=73}} As did much of the slave community, which often took freedom for itself without actuvely joining the revolt.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=24}} Although the slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n===Reasons for failure===\nCandlin emphasises that too little planning was to blame for the eventual failure of the rebellion, particularly regarding supplies and materiel. F\u00e9don had not planned for an eventuality in which he began running out of either, and was, therefore, surprised when this occurred. Further, too much of the island's productive machinery had been destroyed in the early weeks of the uprising without a long-term plan or ability to replace it. F\u00e9don relied on reinforcements that never materialised.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Memorials and cultural impact==\nThe 19th-century Trinidadian novelist [[Edward Lanzer Joseph]]'s ''[[Warner Arundell: The Adventures of a Creole|Warner Arundell]]'', published in 1838, is a historical register of the period in which F\u00e9don is a primary protagonist,{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} a brooding [[Byronic hero]] much favoured by [[Gothic literature]] at the time.{{sfn|Amadori|2014|p=260}} Its characters include many other historical figures of the era, apart from F\u00e9don, such as Ralph Woodford, Victor Hugues and [[Simon Bolivar]].{{sfn|Amadori|2014|p=248 n.133}} A contemporary reviewer for ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' noted that, although \"by the pen of its author, it is evidently founded on a basis of fact\".{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} In Joseph's story, F\u00e9don has survived the rebellion, and while roaming as a criminal in exile, he is haunted by a sense of failure.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Jacob has described F\u00e9don as \"a legend and inspiration to Grenada's artists, nationalists, and revolutionaries\".{{sfn|Jacobs|2008|p=449}} Craton explains F\u00e9don's popular memorialisation as stemming from \"the uncertainty of his fate, for he thereby became a permanent symbol, a mythical hero for political revolutionaries and less politically motivated freedom-loving blacks alike\".{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=210}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite thesis|last=Amadori|first=C.|title=Shape-Shifting Creole Identities: Representations of Creole Figures in Nineteenth-Century Anglophone Transatlantic Literature|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Miami|oclc=638691892}}\n* {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=C.|editor-last1=Bessel|editor-first1=R.|editor-last2=Guyatt|editor-first2=N.|editor-last3=Rendall|editor-first3=J.|title=War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-23028-269-8|location=London|page=210\u2013217|chapter=Old Subjects, New Subjects and Non-Subjects: Silences and Subjecthood in F\u00e9don\u2019s Rebellion, Grenada, 1795\u201396}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.

It is under the administration of [[Sanmenxia]]. Yima is located in the western part of Henan province. It is located in the [[Xiaoshan Old Tracks]], with [[Yangshao Peak]] to the north and [[Balcony Loewe]] to the south. Since ancient times, it was a key point between [[Luoyang]] and [[Changan]]. It has great strategic importance, being often a battlefield or a place for merchants to trade. Yima was founded two years before the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Dynasty]] established the new county system (it took 81 years to build the city). After the [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded, Yima reached county-level status in Henan Province in 1981. It was originally under the administration of [[Luoyang]]. However, since 1986, it has been under the administration of [[Sanmenxia]]. Currently, it is one of the forty-eight counties in Henan Province trying to expand. It is also one of China's top hundred counties, as well as the smallest city in China (112 square kilometers with a population of about 160,000). Yima has the advantage of being self-sustaining, allowing for massive redevelopment of its industry and increased economic growth. In 2010, the city's per capita GDP was over seventy thousand RMB, which is about ten thousand US dollars. It ranks alongside moderately developed countries. In 2010, it was ranked first economically in Henan Province (perennial top five). The city is also known as a \"The Home of Martial Arts\".\n\n==Location==\nYima is in the western part of Henan.

{"title_page": "Jan II the Good", "text_new": "[[File:Sarkofag Jan II Dobrego g\u0142owa.jpg|thumb|250px|Jan II of Opole's sarcophagus]]\n'''Jan II of Opole''' ({{lang-pl|'''Jan II Dobry'''}}) ({{circa|1460}} \u2013 27 March 1532) was a Duke of [[Opole]]-[[Brzeg]] (until 1481)-[[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]]-[[Niemodlin]] in 1476 (with his brothers as co-rulers during 1476), ruler over [[Gliwice]] (in 1494), [[Toszek]] (in 1495), Niemodlin (again, in 1497), [[Bytom]] (in 1498), [[Ko\u017ale]] (in 1509), and [[Racib\u00f3rz]] (in 1521). He belonged to the silesian branch of the Polish [[Piast dynasty]] which was the oldest branch of the first Polish royal dynasty.\n\nHe was born as the second son of Duke [[Nicholas I of Opole]] by his wife Agnes, daughter of Duke [[Ludwik II of Brzeg|Louis II of Brzeg]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early political activities===\nAfter the death of his father and eldest brother [[Louis of Opole|Louis]] in 1476, Jan II initially shared the government over the Duchy with his younger brother [[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]. Soon, however, probably still in 1476, the brothers decided to make the division of their domains: Jan II took over the governments over [[Opole]], [[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]] and [[Brzeg]], while Nicholas II received [[Niemodlin]]. However, this division was only a formality as the two brothers continue to co-rule their whole inheritance.\n\nDuring his long life Jan II led the already small Duchy of Opole to a significant economic development. Not without significance was also his constant acquisition of lands in [[Upper Silesia]], who became him one of the most powerful Silesian rulers.\n\nHowever, the first years of the rule of Jan II weren't successfully. Actually, in 1477 together with Nicholas II, the Duke bought [[Prudnik]] from Duke [[Konrad X the White|Konrad X of Ole\u015bnica]], but four years later (in 1481), under the pressures of Duke [[Frederick I of Legnica]] the brothers must agree to redeem the pledge over [[Brzeg]] since 1450.\n\nOn 27 June 1497 Nicholas II was beheaded in the [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]] market at the behest of [[Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn]], Duke [[Henry I the Elder|Henry I]] of [[Zi\u0119bice]] and the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Jan IV Roth]]. After hearing the news about this events in Nysa, Jan II decided to avenge his brother's death and began to gather troops in order to make a brutally retaliatory expedition against Cieszyn. Only through the diplomatic moves of King [[Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon]] and the absence of support for the war between his neighbors, prevented the civil war in Silesia.\n\n===Expansion of the Duchy===\nSince the 1490s Jan II began a considerable development of his domains. Thanks to the increased debts of several Silesian rulers, within only a few years the Duke of Opole became in the owner of almost the majority of [[Upper Silesia]]. Only [[Cieszyn]] maintain his independence, while [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was annexed by [[Poland]]. The growth of the Duchy of Opole was slowly but continuously: in 1494 was bought [[Gliwice]] and one year later (in 1495) [[Toszek]] was also bought. In 1497, after the death of Nicholas II, [[Niemodlin]] was inherited by Jan II, in 1498 was bought [[Bytom]], and the [[\u015awierklaniec]] castle with his privileges, and finally in 1509 was annexed [[Ko\u017ale]].\n\n===The inheritance of Racib\u00f3rz===\nAfter all the territorial acquisitions, only the entire southern of the Silesian border was governed by the [[Przemyslid]] Dukes of [[Racib\u00f3rz]]. The first contract of mutual inheritance with the then reign Duke [[Jan V of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan V]] was made around 1478, probably on occasion of the marriage between Jan V and Magdalena of Opole, Jan II's sister. However, was only after the unexpected deaths of Jan V's older sons (and Jan II's nephews) [[Nicholas VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Nicholas VI]] and [[Jan VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan VI]] in 1506 and the taking of the youngest and only surviving brother, [[Valentin of Racib\u00f3rz|Valentin]], of the full government over Racib\u00f3rz, when was revived the old treaty with the Duke of Opole.\n\nThe formal contract of mutual inheritance was performed in 1511 between the childless Duke Valentin and Jan II. The contract, who counted with the approval of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon, came into force after the death of Valentin in 1521: Jan II inherited the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz, who was combined with the Duchy of Opole. The newly Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz covered an area from the \u015acinawa and [[Nysa K\u0142odzka]] Rivers in the West, the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Vistula River]] in the south, and the borders with [[Poland]] in the east and north. This represented a territory the size of 12,000 kilometers.\n\nSince the beginning of his reign, Jan II was in favor of the Polish culture, maintain regular contacts with Kings [[John I Albert of Poland|John I Albert]], [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]]. There are even some suggestions that the Jan II knew only the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language]]s (the Czech was the official language in Silesia).\n\nJan II probably preferred to stay in his domains and rarely leave Opole. There is only one known case when the Duke of Opole departed from his Duchy, in 1476, when Jan II went to [[Apulia]] as an envoy of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], in order to escort his bride [[Beatrice of Naples|Beatrice]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]].\n\nJan II had a passion for hunting in the Upper Silesian forests. For this purpose, moreover, he used huge sums of money.\n\n===Privileges===\nJan II, with due regard to the economic development of his domains seemed to granted many privileges, gained fame with the largest 72 articles of the called ''Ordunek G\u00f3rny'' on 16 November 1528 issued in [[Opole]], which was a privilege to develop the mining in the Duchy, which a considerably diminution of the Duke's treasure. In return for the privileges given to the cities, Jan II has received a part of the profits from the mines. Among the beneficiaries of the privileges was [[Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry]], who became in one of the largest and prospers cities of Upper Silesia. Soon before his death in 1531, Jan II also gave privileges to the Opole and Racib\u00f3rz townspeople against the increased oppressions of the nobility (the so-called ''Hanuszowy Privilege'').\n\n===Death and Succession===\nJan II never married or had children. The reason, according to reliable sources, was he was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. Consequently, many years before his death, Jan II saw the competition between various rulers for his inheritance. Candidates for the domains of the childless were, among others, the King of [[Bohemia]] (firstly [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II Jagiellon]] and since 1526 [[Ferdinand I of Habsburg]]), [[Zdenko Lew]], [[Burgrave]] of [[Prague]], and Dukes [[Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn|Casimir II of Cieszyn]] and [[Frederick II of Legnica]]. Initially, the slightest chance of be declared heir of Jan II was to [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. However, the Margrave gained the support of King Louis II and particularly the favor of the old Duke of Opole.

He belonged to the silesian branch of the Polish [[Piast dynasty]] which was the oldest branch of the first Polish royal dynasty.\n\nHe was born as the second son of Duke [[Nicholas I of Opole]] by his wife Agnes, daughter of Duke [[Ludwik II of Brzeg|Louis II of Brzeg]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early political activities===\nAfter the death of his father and eldest brother [[Louis of Opole|Louis]] in 1476, Jan II initially shared the government over the Duchy with his younger brother [[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]. Soon, however, probably still in 1476, the brothers decided to make the division of their domains: Jan II took over the governments over [[Opole]], [[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]] and [[Brzeg]], while Nicholas II received [[Niemodlin]]. However, this division was only a formality as the two brothers continue to co-rule their whole inheritance.\n\nDuring his long life Jan II led the already small Duchy of Opole to a significant economic development. Not without significance was also his constant acquisition of lands in [[Upper Silesia]], who became him one of the most powerful Silesian rulers.\n\nHowever, the first years of the rule of Jan II weren't successfully. Actually, in 1477 together with Nicholas II, the Duke bought [[Prudnik]] from Duke [[Konrad X the White|Konrad X of Ole\u015bnica]], but four years later (in 1481), under the pressures of Duke [[Frederick I of Legnica]] the brothers must agree to redeem the pledge over [[Brzeg]] since 1450.\n\nOn 27 June 1497 Nicholas II was beheaded in the [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]] market at the behest of Duke Casimir II of Cieszyn, Duke [[Henry I the Elder|Henry I]] of [[Zi\u0119bice]] and the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Jan IV Roth]]. After hearing the news about this events in Nysa, Jan II decided to avenge his brother's death and began to gather troops in order to make a brutally retaliatory expedition against Cieszyn. Only through the diplomatic moves of King [[Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon]] and the absence of support for the war between his neighbors, prevented the civil war in Silesia.\n\n===Expansion of the Duchy===\nSince the 1490s Jan II began a considerable development of his domains. Thanks to the increased debts of several Silesian rulers, within only a few years the Duke of Opole became in the owner of almost the majority of [[Upper Silesia]]. Only [[Cieszyn]] maintain his independence, while [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was annexed by [[Poland]]. The growth of the Duchy of Opole was slowly but continuously: in 1494 was bought [[Gliwice]] and one year later (in 1495) [[Toszek]] was also bought. In 1497, after the death of Nicholas II, [[Niemodlin]] was inherited by Jan II, in 1498 was bought [[Bytom]], and the [[\u015awierklaniec]] castle with his privileges, and finally in 1509 was annexed [[Ko\u017ale]].\n\n===The inheritance of Racib\u00f3rz===\nAfter all the territorial acquisitions, only the entire southern of the Silesian border was governed by the [[Przemyslid]] Dukes of [[Racib\u00f3rz]]. The first contract of mutual inheritance with the then reign Duke [[Jan V of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan V]] was made around 1478, probably on occasion of the marriage between Jan V and Magdalena of Opole, Jan II's sister. However, was only after the unexpected deaths of Jan V's older sons (and Jan II's nephews) [[Nicholas VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Nicholas VI]] and [[Jan VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan VI]] in 1506 and the taking of the youngest and only surviving brother, [[Valentin of Racib\u00f3rz|Valentin]], of the full government over Racib\u00f3rz, when was revived the old treaty with the Duke of Opole.\n\nThe formal contract of mutual inheritance was performed in 1511 between the childless Duke Valentin and Jan II. The contract, who counted with the approval of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon, came into force after the death of Valentin in 1521: Jan II inherited the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz, who was combined with the Duchy of Opole. The newly Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz covered an area from the \u015acinawa and [[Nysa K\u0142odzka]] Rivers in the West, the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Vistula River]] in the south, and the borders with [[Poland]] in the east and north. This represented a territory the size of 12,000 kilometers.\n\nSince the beginning of his reign, Jan II was in favor of the Polish culture, maintain regular contacts with Kings [[John I Albert of Poland|John I Albert]], [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]]. There are even some suggestions that the Jan II knew only the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language]]s (the Czech was the official language in Silesia).\n\nJan II probably preferred to stay in his domains and rarely leave Opole. There is only one known case when the Duke of Opole departed from his Duchy, in 1476, when Jan II went to [[Apulia]] as an envoy of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], in order to escort his bride [[Beatrice of Naples|Beatrice]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]].\n\nJan II had a passion for hunting in the Upper Silesian forests. For this purpose, moreover, he used huge sums of money.\n\n===Privileges===\nJan II, with due regard to the economic development of his domains seemed to granted many privileges, gained fame with the largest 72 articles of the called ''Ordunek G\u00f3rny'' on 16 November 1528 issued in [[Opole]], which was a privilege to develop the mining in the Duchy, which a considerably diminution of the Duke's treasure. In return for the privileges given to the cities, Jan II has received a part of the profits from the mines. Among the beneficiaries of the privileges was [[Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry]], who became in one of the largest and prospers cities of Upper Silesia. Soon before his death in 1531, Jan II also gave privileges to the Opole and Racib\u00f3rz townspeople against the increased oppressions of the nobility (the so-called ''Hanuszowy Privilege'').\n\n===Death and Succession===\nJan II never married or had children. The reason, according to reliable sources, was he was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. Consequently, many years before his death, Jan II saw the competition between various rulers for his inheritance. Candidates for the domains of the childless were, among others, the King of [[Bohemia]] (firstly [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II Jagiellon]] and since 1526 [[Ferdinand I of Habsburg]]), [[Zdenko Lew]], [[Burgrave]] of [[Prague]], and Dukes [[Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn|Casimir II of Cieszyn]] and [[Frederick II of Legnica]]. Initially, the slightest chance of be declared heir of Jan II was to [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. However, the Margrave gained the support of King Louis II and particularly the favor of the old Duke of Opole. The death of Louis II and the succession of Ferdinand I of Habsburg in the Bohemian-Hungarian Kingdom put in jeopardy the chances of George of Brandenburg. Only after the sign of a treaty in Prague on 17 June 1531 and the payment of 183,333 [[guilder]]s to King Ferdinand I persuaded him to accept the candidacy of the Margrave of Ansbach.\n\nJan II, the last male member of the Opole branch, died in [[Racib\u00f3rz]] on 27 March 1532 and was buried in the church of Holy Cross in [[Opole]].\n\nAfter the death, the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz was inherited by George of Brandenburg-Ansbach. In accordance with previous agreements, the movable property was exported to [[Vienna]].\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast8.html#N1O |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#NikolausIdied1476 |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*[http://wwperson.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/cgi-bin/llmult/LANG=engl/F=Johann/N=v.Schlesien-Oppeln-Beuthen Gynealogical database by Herbert Stoyan]\n*[http://www.poczet.com/jandobry.htm JAN (JANUSZ) II DOBRY (OPOLSKI)]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]||{{circa|1460}}|27 March|1532}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|rows=4|before=[[Nicholas I of Opole|Nicholas I]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Opole]]<br/> ''with Louis (until 1476)<br/> and Nicholas II (until 1497)''|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|after= Unification with the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Brzeg]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II<br/> (until 1476)''|years=1476\u20131481}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Fryderyk I of Legnica|Frederick I]]}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Strzelce]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II<br/> (until 1476)''|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|after=Incorporated to the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Niemodlin]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II''|years=1476}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Niemodlin]]|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|rows=3|after=Incorporated to the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|rows=2|before=Direct sovereignty of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]<br/><small>last holder</small><br/>[[Konrad X the White]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Bytom]]|years=1498\u20131521}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Ko\u017ale]]|years=1509\u20131521}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Valentin of Racib\u00f3rz|Valentin]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Racib\u00f3rz]]|years=1521}}\n{{s-aft|after=Unification with the Duchy of Opole}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=\u2014}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz]]|years=1521\u20131532}}\n{{s-aft|after=Extinct}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1460s births]]\n[[Category:1532 deaths]]\n[[Category:Piast dynasty]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly political activities", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_II_the_Good"}
