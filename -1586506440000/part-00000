In 1870, one of Thomas Baldwin's sons, Francis Baldwin, became a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] representing Queens County's 2nd District; he later served as the Queens County treasurer.<ref name=\"Baldwin History\"/> (During this time, Baldwinsville was part of [[Queens County, New York|Queens County]].) A year later, the name of the village was changed from Baldwinsville to Baldwins by the [[U.S. Postal Service]] so as to not confuse it with the village of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]] in upstate New York. By 1892, by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nShortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began to move to \"Beautiful Baldwin\", as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a village realtor. The village had fine boating (sailboats), bathing, and fishing. By 1939, ten years after the opening of [[New York State Route 27|Sunrise Highway]], Baldwin became the largest unincorporated village in New York State\u2014a title that was lost to [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] by 1960.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1990 US Census, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was designated as Baldwin Harbor, a hamlet (and census-designated place). Baldwin Harbor remains a part of the Town of Baldwin's ZIP code, school district, and library system.\n\nIn May 1910, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made in Baldwin.  The first all-American [[monoplane]] was designed, built, and successfully flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. The project was developed at the site now occupied by the Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville Drive. In the plane's initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that were combined into one stick, which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using one hand.\n\n==Geography==\nThe community is located in the southwest part of Nassau County.

The boundaries of the Baldwin School District are not identical with those of Baldwin itself, also containing the Stearns Park neighborhood of [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], up to Knollwood Road in [[Rockville Centre]] (which is a few blocks away from South Side High School) and a few blocks from other neighboring villages. A small portion of Baldwin, located to the West of Silver Lake, is included in the [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]] Union Free School District.\n\nAs of September 2012, the Baldwin Public Schools consist of seven schools with a total enrollment of approximately 5500 students. There is one [[High school (North America)|high school]], [[Baldwin Senior High School (Baldwin, New York)|Baldwin Senior High School]], and one [[middle school]], [[Baldwin Middle School]]. There are five [[Primary education|elementary schools]] spaced throughout the town: Brookside, Lenox, Meadow, Plaza, and Steele.\n\nBaldwin Senior High School is a Nationally Recognized School of Excellence, and as of 2011, is the eighth-largest high school in Nassau County, New York.<ref>Baldwin UFSD Website</ref>  Baldwin Senior High School was ranked by ''Newsweek'' in its annual list of America's Best High Schools.  In 2010, it was ranked #837 in the entire United States, #804 in 2008, #971 in 2007, and #602 in 2006.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/americas-best-high-schools/list.html</ref>  The high school offers a multitude of extracurricular clubs, varsity sports, and a robotics team.  Baldwin Senior High School offers Advanced Placement courses that may enable students to earn college credit, and the school produced two National Merit Commended Students, who achieved scores in the top 5% of the more than 1.5 million students who took the PSAT in 2009.\n\nThe high school is located near the north-central part of town, and the middle school near the south end. [[school bus|Buses]] are run to both of these schools. Most students are able to walk to their elementary schools. The elementary schools contain kindergarten to fifth grade. The middle school contains grades six through eight\u2014but the sixth graders spend most of their time in a separate wing except for music, gym, lunch, arts, computers, technology, and language. The high school contains grades nine through twelve.\n\nThree former elementary schools were closed in June 1980: Prospect School was torn down, along with the former Baldwin Junior High School and former Baldwin Senior High School which were combined in one building in the 1980s to make way for a housing complex; Coolidge School on Grand Avenue has been converted to condominiums; Harbor Elementary School on Hastings Street is now the school district office building. Two additional elementary schools, Milburn and Shubert, were closed in June 2012 as the result of enrollment changes and cuts in state funding.\n\nThe district is governed by a five-member elected [[board of education]]. Dr. Shari Camhi is the superintendent of schools.\n\nBaldwin also has one [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school, St. Christopher's. This school was established in 1925 as part of St. Christopher's parish. The school serves students from Baldwin, Freeport, and surrounding areas, and it ranges from kindergarten to eighth grade. Although originally staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, most of the school's faculty consists of lay people. Originally the school was one building that housed all classes, however it has been expanded twice. The school now consists of the \"original building\" (now housing classrooms, a gym, stage, computer lab, and music room), the \"middle building\" (housing the school and religious education offices, classrooms and an art room), and the \"new building\" (housing a cafeteria, library, and classrooms). Over the years the school has gained a highly regarded reputation in the Baldwin community. Students from the school participate in a wide variety of both Catholic and community events. For example, students take religion classes from kindergarten to the eighth grade, as well as march in the Baldwin Memorial Day Parade and help out at Baldwin's Big Sweep (a community event in which volunteers clean up Grand Avenue).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Bob Beckwith]], FDNY veteran, stood next to President [[George W.

A third enterprise was his sawmill, which he operated by Silver Lake just southeast of the hotel.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\">[http://www.baldwinchamber.com/contact.asp Baldwin Chamber of Commerce: History and Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902034915/http://www.baldwinchamber.com/contact.asp |date=2012-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, the [[South Side Railroad of Long Island|South Side Rail Road]] began operating with a [[Baldwin (LIRR station)|station]] in Baldwinsville. In 1870, one of Thomas Baldwin's sons, Francis Baldwin, became a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] representing Queens County's 2nd District; he later served as the Queens County treasurer.<ref name=\"Baldwin History\"/> (During this time, Baldwinsville was part of [[Queens County, New York|Queens County]].) A year later, the name of the village was changed from Baldwinsville to Baldwins by the [[U.S. Postal Service]] so as to not confuse it with the village of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]] in upstate New York. By 1892, by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nShortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began to move to \"Beautiful Baldwin\", as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a village realtor. The village had fine boating (sailboats), bathing, and fishing. By 1939, ten years after the opening of [[New York State Route 27|Sunrise Highway]], Baldwin became the largest unincorporated village in New York State\u2014a title that was lost to [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] by 1960.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1990 US Census, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was designated as Baldwin Harbor, a hamlet (and census-designated place). Baldwin Harbor remains a part of the Town of Baldwin's ZIP code, school district, and library system.\n\nIn May 1910, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made in Baldwin.  The first all-American [[monoplane]] was designed, built, and successfully flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. The project was developed at the site now occupied by the Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville Drive. In the plane's initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that were combined into one stick, which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using one hand.\n\n==Geography==\nThe community is located in the southwest part of Nassau County.

The boundaries of the Baldwin School District are not identical with those of Baldwin itself, also containing the Stearns Park neighborhood of [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], up to Knollwood Road in [[Rockville Centre]] (which is a few blocks away from South Side High School) and a few blocks from other neighboring villages. A small portion of Baldwin, located to the West of Silver Lake, is included in the [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]] Union Free School District.\n\nAs of September 2012, the Baldwin Public Schools consist of seven schools with a total enrollment of approximately 5500 students. There is one [[High school (North America)|high school]], [[Baldwin Senior High School (Baldwin, New York)|Baldwin Senior High School]], and one [[middle school]], [[Baldwin Middle School]]. There are five [[Primary education|elementary schools]] spaced throughout the town: Brookside, Lenox, Meadow, Plaza, and Steele.\n\nBaldwin Senior High School is a Nationally Recognized School of Excellence, and as of 2011, is the eighth-largest high school in Nassau County, New York.<ref>Baldwin UFSD Website</ref>  Baldwin Senior High School was ranked by ''Newsweek'' in its annual list of America's Best High Schools.  In 2010, it was ranked #837 in the entire United States, #804 in 2008, #971 in 2007, and #602 in 2006.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/americas-best-high-schools/list.html</ref>  The high school offers a multitude of extracurricular clubs, varsity sports, and a robotics team.  Baldwin Senior High School offers Advanced Placement courses that may enable students to earn college credit, and the school produced two National Merit Commended Students, who achieved scores in the top 5% of the more than 1.5 million students who took the PSAT in 2009.\n\nThe high school is located near the north-central part of town, and the middle school near the south end. [[school bus|Buses]] are run to both of these schools. Most students are able to walk to their elementary schools. The elementary schools contain kindergarten to fifth grade. The middle school contains grades six through eight\u2014but the sixth graders spend most of their time in a separate wing except for music, gym, lunch, arts, computers, technology, and language. The high school contains grades nine through twelve.\n\nThree former elementary schools were closed in June 1980: Prospect School was torn down, along with the former Baldwin Junior High School and former Baldwin Senior High School which were combined in one building in the 1980s to make way for a housing complex; Coolidge School on Grand Avenue has been converted to condominiums; Harbor Elementary School on Hastings Street is now the school district office building. Two additional elementary schools, Milburn and Shubert, were closed in June 2012 as the result of enrollment changes and cuts in state funding.\n\nThe district is governed by a five-member elected [[board of education]]. Dr. Shari Camhi is the superintendent of schools.\n\nBaldwin also has one [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school, St. Christopher's. This school was established in 1925 as part of St. Christopher's parish. The school serves students from Baldwin, Freeport, and surrounding areas, and it ranges from kindergarten to eighth grade. Although originally staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, most of the school's faculty consists of lay people. Originally the school was one building that housed all classes, however it has been expanded twice. The school now consists of the \"original building\" (now housing classrooms, a gym, stage, computer lab, and music room), the \"middle building\" (housing the school and religious education offices, classrooms and an art room), and the \"new building\" (housing a cafeteria, library, and classrooms). Over the years the school has gained a highly regarded reputation in the Baldwin community. Students from the school participate in a wide variety of both Catholic and community events. For example, students take religion classes from kindergarten to the eighth grade, as well as march in the Baldwin Memorial Day Parade and help out at Baldwin's Big Sweep (a community event in which volunteers clean up Grand Avenue).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Bob Beckwith]], FDNY veteran, stood next to President [[George W.
