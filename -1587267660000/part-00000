Bruised and cut, but still intact. Her hair is matted and dirty now, her tight vest is torn, her hip-hugging jeans no so white, but she's still alive. Whether this is a good thing, she does not yet know. For now, tied up, face to face with maniacs she thought she'd never see again (Hitchhiker: \"I thought you was in a hurry?!\"), it is all too much. Her eyes go wide before she blacks out. And then she wakes, from one nightmare into another.\"<ref>{{Cite book|first=Xavier|last=Mendik|title=Shocking Cinema of the Seventies|publisher=Noir Publishing|location=Hereford, England|date=2002|isbn=0-95365-644-6|page=191}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don\u2019t They Do It Like They Used To?'', David Roche contrasts Sally to [[Laurie Strode]] from the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]] stating: \"All in all, Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode have very little in common, apart from the fact that both characters survive the horror they have witnessed\" and goes on to say that \"Sally, the hippie, is very \"feminine\" and not especially heroic: she undergoes intense suffering, attempts to sell her body, and seems to lose her mind. Sally is, in effect, the most resisting body. As such, the character of Sally simultaneously enables the Family to attempt to assert its masculinity in the face of the abject female and contributes to the discovery of the instability of sexist patriarchal values by bearing witness to the way the Family's mimicry of patriarchy reveals its constructiveness;  these two functions coalesce in the shots of Sally's eyes. I would, thus, argue that the character of Sally by no means represents a feminist development, but her resilience does enable an anti-essentialist subtext to emerge to some extent.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don\u2019t They Do It Like They Used To?|last=Roche|first=David|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=Jackson, Mississippi|date=2014|isbn=1-62674-246-4|pages=}}</ref> However, James Rose<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|last=Rose|first=James|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781906733995|location=|pages=}}</ref> believes that Sally and Laurie have a lot of similarities, stating:\n:\"Possibly the most significant impact Hooper's film has had upon the horror genre is its sustained trauma of Sally Hardesty. The juxtaposition of her terrible plight but eventual survival seemingly reconfigured the genre and created, as Clover has termed it, the character of the Final Girl. Yet, for all her endurance, Sally is not the ''first'' Final Girl but more a survivor who stands alongside ''Halloween'''s Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis); for as much as both survive, each, in the end, requires male intervention to fully save them from the narrative's male antagonist: Sally is rescued by a passing driver, while Laurie is saved by Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance{{sic|expexted=Pleasence}}). Despite this, both Sally and Laurie combine to make manifest the key attributes of the Final Girl as both struggled, endured and, in Laurie's case, attacked their aggressor until they could escape and be saved. In the slasher films that followed in the wake of Chain Saw and Halloween, the Final Girl steadily gains in strength until she herself vanquishes the male antagonist.\"\n\nHe goes on to state the difference between the two:\n:\"It is this that prevents Sally from being a true Final Girl, for she (unlike Laurie and all the others that followed) never turns upon her aggressors and attacks ''them''. Instead, she simply endures, runs from them and, by chancem seizes an opportunity to escape. However, this is not to disagree with Clover's positioning of Sally as a Final Girl, as she does indeed endure and it is this that makes her so noteworthy.\"\n\nEditor Stefano Lo Verme compared Burns's performance as Sally to the performances of [[Sandra Peabody]] as [[Mari Collingwood]] in ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{Cite web|first=Stefano|last=Lo Verme|url=https://movieplayer.it/articoli/le-scream-queen-piu-affascinanti-del-cinema-horror_16022/|title=SCREAMING ACTRESSES: FROM VERA FARMIGA TO JAMIE LEE CURTIS, THE GREAT SCREAM QUEEN BETWEEN CINEMA AND TV|website=[[MoviePlayer]]|date=June 25, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 5, 2018|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name|id=0045475|character=Sally Hardesty}}\n\n{{The Texas Chainsaw Massacre}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hardesty, Sally}}\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional sole survivors]]\n[[Category:The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters]]\n[[Category:Final girls]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| color              = #701517\n| name               = Sally Hardesty\n| series             = [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]\n| image              = File:Marilyn_Burns_as_Sally_Hardesty_in_The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre.png\n| caption            = [[Marilyn Burns]] portraying Sally in ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974)\n| first              = ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974)\n| last               = ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' (2013)\n| creator            = [[Tobe Hooper]]\n| portrayer          = [[Marilyn Burns]]\n| full_name          = Sally Hardesty\n| gender             = Female\n| family             = Unnamed grandfather<br>Ted Hardesty (father)<ref name=\"SallyDad\">{{cite web|first=John|last=Squires |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3423936/exclusive-will-meet-sally-franklins-father-leatherface/ |title=[Exclusive] We Will Meet Sally and Franklin\u2019s Father in \u2018Leatherface\u2019 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=February 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref><br>Lefty Enright (uncle)<br>Franklin Hardesty (brother)\n}}\n\n'''Sally Hardesty''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]].

Burns did most of her own stunts during filming such as jumping through the window during the ending and during the dinner scene, her finger was actually cut by a real knife with no fake blood being used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/marilynburns/|title=Lady of the Chainsaw: An Interview with Marilyn Burns|last=|first=|date=January 2004|website=The Terror Trap|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classic-horror.com/newsreel/marilyn_burns_texas_chain_saw_massacre_interview|title=Marilyn Burns (\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\") Interview|last=Yapp|first=Nate|date=October 30, 2010|website=Classic-Horror.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref> Originally, the 2003 remake was intended to be told in flashback format with an aged Sally recounting her experience with Leatherface to authorities.

Bruised and cut, but still intact. Her hair is matted and dirty now, her tight vest is torn, her hip-hugging jeans no so white, but she's still alive. Whether this is a good thing, she does not yet know. For now, tied up, face to face with maniacs she thought she'd never see again (Hitchhiker: \"I thought you was in a hurry?!\"), it is all too much. Her eyes go wide before she blacks out. And then she wakes, from one nightmare into another.\"<ref>{{Cite book|first=Xavier|last=Mendik|title=Shocking Cinema of the Seventies|publisher=Noir Publishing|location=Hereford, England|date=2002|isbn=0-95365-644-6|page=191}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don\u2019t They Do It Like They Used To?'', David Roche contrasts Sally to [[Laurie Strode]] from the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]] stating: \"All in all, Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode have very little in common, apart from the fact that both characters survive the horror they have witnessed\" and goes on to say that \"Sally, the hippie, is very \"feminine\" and not especially heroic: she undergoes intense suffering, attempts to sell her body, and seems to lose her mind. Sally is, in effect, the most resisting body. As such, the character of Sally simultaneously enables the Family to attempt to assert its masculinity in the face of the abject female and contributes to the discovery of the instability of sexist patriarchal values by bearing witness to the way the Family's mimicry of patriarchy reveals its constructiveness;  these two functions coalesce in the shots of Sally's eyes. I would, thus, argue that the character of Sally by no means represents a feminist development, but her resilience does enable an anti-essentialist subtext to emerge to some extent.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don\u2019t They Do It Like They Used To?|last=Roche|first=David|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=Jackson, Mississippi|date=2014|isbn=1-62674-246-4|pages=}}</ref> However, James Rose<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|last=Rose|first=James|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781906733995|location=|pages=}}</ref> believes that Sally and Laurie have a lot of similarities, stating:\n:\"Possibly the most significant impact Hooper's film has had upon the horror genre is its sustained trauma of Sally Hardesty. The juxtaposition of her terrible plight but eventual survival seemingly reconfigured the genre and created, as Clover has termed it, the character of the Final Girl. Yet, for all her endurance, Sally is not the ''first'' Final Girl but more a survivor who stands alongside ''Halloween'''s Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis); for as much as both survive, each, in the end, requires male intervention to fully save them from the narrative's male antagonist: Sally is rescued by a passing driver, while Laurie is saved by Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance{{sic|expexted=Pleasence}}). Despite this, both Sally and Laurie combine to make manifest the key attributes of the Final Girl as both struggled, endured and, in Laurie's case, attacked their aggressor until they could escape and be saved. In the slasher films that followed in the wake of Chain Saw and Halloween, the Final Girl steadily gains in strength until she herself vanquishes the male antagonist.\"\n\nHe goes on to state the difference between the two:\n:\"It is this that prevents Sally from being a true Final Girl, for she (unlike Laurie and all the others that followed) never turns upon her aggressors and attacks ''them''. Instead, she simply endures, runs from them and, by chancem seizes an opportunity to escape. However, this is not to disagree with Clover's positioning of Sally as a Final Girl, as she does indeed endure and it is this that makes her so noteworthy.\"\n\nEditor Stefano Lo Verme compared Burns's performance as Sally to the performances of [[Sandra Peabody]] as [[Mari Collingwood]] in ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{Cite web|first=Stefano|last=Lo Verme|url=https://movieplayer.it/articoli/le-scream-queen-piu-affascinanti-del-cinema-horror_16022/|title=SCREAMING ACTRESSES: FROM VERA FARMIGA TO JAMIE LEE CURTIS, THE GREAT SCREAM QUEEN BETWEEN CINEMA AND TV|website=[[MoviePlayer]]|date=June 25, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 5, 2018|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name|id=0045475|character=Sally Hardesty}}\n\n{{The Texas Chainsaw Massacre}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hardesty, Sally}}\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional sole survivors]]\n[[Category:The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters]]\n[[Category:Final girls]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n", "name_user": "GamingDude2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hardesty"}
