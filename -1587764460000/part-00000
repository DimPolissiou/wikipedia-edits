It had the most significant oil fields in Europe, and Germany eagerly bought its petroleum, as well as food exports. \n\n[[Carol I of Romania|King Carol]] favored Germany but after his death in 1914, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] and the nation's political elite favored the Entente. For Romania, the highest priority was taking [[Transylvania]] from Hungary, with around 2,800,000 Romanians out of 5,000,000 people. [[Allies of World War I|The Allies]] wanted Romania to join its side in order to cut the rail communications between Germany and Turkey, and to cut off Germany's oil supplies.\n\nBritain made loans, France sent a [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|military training mission]], and Russia promised modern munitions. The Allies promised at least 200,000 soldiers to defend Romania against Bulgaria to the south, and help it invade Austria.\n\nThe '''Romanian campaign''' was part of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War I]], with [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] allied with Britain and France against the [[Central Powers]] of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. Fighting took place from August 1916 to December 1917 across most of present-day Romania, including [[Transylvania]], which was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the time, as well as in [[Southern Dobruja]], which is currently part of [[Bulgaria]].\n\nThe Romanian Campaign Plan (The \"Z\" Hypothesis) consisted in attacking [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria-Hungary]] in Transylvania, while defending Southern Dobruja and [[Giurgiu County|Giurgiu]] from Bulgaria in the south. Despite initial successes in Transylvania, after German divisions started aiding Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, the Romanian forces (aided by Russia) suffered massive setbacks, and by the end of 1916 out of the territory of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] only [[Western Moldavia]] remained under the control of the Romanian and Russian armies.\n\nAfter several defensive victories in 1917 at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]], with Russia's withdrawal from the war following the [[October Revolution]], Romania, almost completely surrounded by the Central Powers, was also forced to drop out of the war, it signed the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers in May 1918. The parliament signed the treaty, however [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] refused to sign it hoping for an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory on the western front. On 10 November 1918, just one day before the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|German armistice]] and after all the other Central Powers had already capitulated, Romania re-entered the war after the successful Allied advances on the [[Macedonian front]].\n\n==Before the war==\n[[File:A Vlaicu III 03.png|thumb|Romanian [[A Vlaicu III|Vlaicu III]] monoplane, built just prior to [[World War I]]]]\n[[File:1915 - Scut de tran\u015fee construit la Atelierele CFR.PNG|thumb|Gun [[mantlet]] built at Atelierele CFR]]\nThe Kingdom of Romania was ruled by kings of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] from 1866. In 1883, the [[King of Romania]], [[Carol I of Hohenzollern]], signed a secret treaty with the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] that stipulated Romania's obligation to go to war only in the event that Austria-Hungary was attacked. While Carol wanted to enter World War I as an ally of the Central Powers, the Romanian public and the political parties were in favor of joining the [[Triple Entente]].\n\nRomania remained neutral when the war started, arguing that Austria-Hungary itself had started the war and, consequently, Romania was under no formal obligation to join it.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwcWDFZWuJgC&pg=PA102 |title=Brief Romanian Military History |author-first=C\u0103lin |author-last=Hentea |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=102 |isbn=9780810858206}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&pg=PA208 |title=A Companion to World War I |author-first=Jean-Jacques|author-last=Becker |chapter=Chapter Fourteen: War Aims and Neutrality |editor-first=John |editor-last=Horne |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=208 |isbn=9781405123860}}</ref> At the same time, Germany started encouraging Austro-Hungary to make territorial concessions to Romania and Italy in order to keep both states neutral.<ref name=\"Herwig2014\">{{cite book|author=Holger H.

The Romanians' greatest concerns in negotiations were the avoidance of a conflict that would have to be fought on two fronts (one in [[Dobruja]] with [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgaria]] and one in Transylvania) and written guarantees of Romanian territorial gains after the war. They demanded an agreement not to make a separate peace with the Central Powers, equal status at the future peace conference, Russian military assistance against Bulgaria, an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] offensive in the direction of Bulgaria, and the regular shipment of Allied war supplies. The military convention they signed with the Allies stipulated that [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] should start an offensive against Bulgaria and the [[Ottoman Empire]] no later than August 1916, that Russia would send troops into Dobruja, and that the Romanian army would not be subordinated to Russian command. The Allies were to send 300 tons of provisions on a daily basis. According to the Romanian account, most of these clauses, with the exception of those imposed on Romania, failed to be respected.<ref>Marcel Mitrasca, ''Moldova: A Romanian Province under Russian Rule. Diplomatic History from the Archives of the Great Powers'', pg. 56</ref>\n\nThe Allies accepted the terms late in the summer of 1916 (''see [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1916]]''); [[Cyril Falls]] attributes the late decision to Romania's historical hostility towards the Russian Empire and purports that an earlier entry into the war, perhaps before the [[Brusilov Offensive]] the same year, would have provided better chance for victory.<ref>Cyril Falls, ''The Great War'' p. 228</ref> According to some American military historians, Russia delayed approval of Romanian demands out of worries about Romanian territorial designs on Bessarabia, claimed by nationalist circles as a Romanian land.<ref>Vincent Esposito, ''Atlas of American Wars, Vol 2'', text for map 37</ref> According to British military historian [[John Keegan]], before Romania entered the war, the Allies had secretly agreed not to honour the territorial expansion of Romania when the war ended.<ref>John Keegan, ''The First World War'', pg. 306</ref>\n[[File:Afi\u0219-247x300.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sketch pleading for the entry of Romania into war against Austria-Hungary in order to create [[Greater Romania]] (''Ilustra\u0163iunea'' magazine, November 1915)]]\n[[File:WWI Poster Rumania.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] poster, welcoming Romania's decision to join the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente]]]]\nIn 1915, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|Christopher Thomson]], a fluent speaker of French, was sent to Bucharest as British military attach\u00e9 on the initiative of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to bring Romania into the war. Once there, he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on two fronts would be a liability, not an asset, to the Allies. This view was brushed aside by [[Whitehall]], and Thomson signed a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916. Within a few months, he had to alleviate the consequences of Romania's setbacks and supervise the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to Germany.<ref>''To Ride the Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101'' by Sir Peter G.

The Romanian ambassador in Vienna actually transmitted the declaration of war on 27 August. Germany, caught by surprise, responded with a declaration of war on Romania the next day (28 August). The dates of the Bulgarian and Ottoman declarations of war are disputed. Ian Beckett says that Bulgaria did not issue a declaration of war prior to its attack of 31 August.<ref>Ian F. W.

Meanwhile, the German Chief of Staff, General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], had correctly reasoned that Romania would side with the Allies, and had made plans accordingly. Thanks to the earlier conquest of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the ineffective Allied operations on the [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] border (the [[Salonica campaigns]]), and having a territorial interest in Dobruja, the [[Bulgarian Army]] and the [[Ottoman Army]] were willing to help fight the Romanians.\n\nThe German high command was seriously worried about the prospect of Romania entering the war, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] writing:\n\n<blockquote>It is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage.<ref>Paul von Hindenburg, Out of My Life, Vol. I, trans. F.A.

Although most Transylvanian Romanians were loyal to the Empire, over time, reactionary sentiments emerged, especially after Romania joined the war. Many of the previously loyal soldiers decided that it was much better to risk their lives through desertion, rather than shoot their ethnical conationals. Many novels have been written on this subject, including Liviu Rebreanu's [[Forest_of_the_Hanged_(novel)|Forest of the Hanged]]. Romanian troops fought on all European fronts of the Dual Monarchy, some of them being distinguished, such as [[Hauptmann]] (''C\u0103pitan'') [[Gheorghe Flondor]] and [[Second lieutenant|Leutnant]] (''Locotenent'') [[Emil Rebreanu]]. Other notable Romanians who fought in the Austro-Hungarian Army included [[First lieutenant|Oberleutnant]] (''Locotenent-Major'') and Imperial Adviser [[Constantin Isopescu-Grecul]], as well as [[Octavian Codru T\u0103sl\u0103uanu]], who also wrote valuable memoirs about his war experience. [[Samoil\u0103 M\u00e2rza]], a private in the Austro-Hungarian Army, reached as far as Riga and became the first Romanian war photographer. In total, up to 150,000 Romanians were killed in action while fighting as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army.<ref>Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow.

In areas populated with Romanians, the Romanian troops were warmly welcomed, and the locals provided them considerable assistance in terms of provisions, billeting and guiding.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 829</ref> However, the rapid Romanian advance alarmed the Central Powers, and within weeks sizable reinforcements began arriving at the scene. The Entente incorrectly assumed that Germany would be unable to respond to the invasion, as the [[Battle of the Somme]] and the [[Brusilov Offensive]] were at their height around this time and tied down significant German forces. Nevertheless, eight divisions and an Alpine Corps were deployed under the command of [[Erich von Falkenhayn]]. The Austro-Hungarians also sent four divisions to reinforce their lines, and by the middle of September, the Romanian offensive was halted. A separate Romanian offensive, carried out by the 1st Infantry Division, was much more limited in its aims and it succeeded: [[Battle of Orsova|capturing]] the west bank of the [[Cerna (Danube)|Cerna River]] within the [[Banat]] region. The Romanian occupation of the area lasted for over two months, until mid-November. \n\nWhile the Romanian Army was advancing in Transylvania, the first counterattack came from Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] in command of a multi-national force composed of the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]], a German brigade and two divisions of the [[VI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman VI Army Corps]], whose units began arriving on the [[Dobrudja]] front after the initial battles.<ref>''\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1915 - 1918, vol.

The Romanian garrison of [[Turtucaia]], encircled by Bulgarian troops (aided by a column of German troops) surrendered on September 6 at the conclusion of the [[Battle of Turtucaia]]. The Romanian Third Army made further attempts to withstand the enemy offensive at [[Silistra]], [[Battle of Dobrich|Dobrich]], [[Amzacea]] and [[Topraisar]], but had to withdraw under the pressure of superior enemy forces. Mackensen's success was favoured by the failure of the Allies to fulfill the obligation they had assumed through the military convention, by virtue of which they had to mount an offensive on the Macedonian front and the conditions in which the Russians deployed insufficient troops on the battlefront in the south-east of Romania. These factors meant that the Romanian forces became too strained to put up effective resistance against the enemy advance. Romania had to fight on two 1,600&nbsp;km-long battlefronts, the longest front in Europe, with a varied configuration and diverse geographical elements (by comparison, the Russian front, stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Bukovina]], was only 1,000&nbsp;km long).<ref name=\"Romania830\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 830</ref>\n\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-c\u00e1rpatos--rumaniassacrific00neguuoft.png|thumb|right|150px|Romanian troops in Transylvania, 1916]]\nOn September 15, the Romanian War Council decided to suspend the Transylvania offensive and concentrate on the Mackensen army group instead. The plan (the so-called ''[[Fl\u0103m\u00e2nda Offensive]]'') was to attack the Central Powers forces from the rear by crossing the Danube at [[Fl\u0103m\u00e2nda]], while the front-line Romanian and Russian forces were supposed to launch an offensive southwards towards [[Cobadin]] and [[Kurtbunar]]. Russian reinforcements under General [[Andrei Zaionchkovsky]] arrived to halt Mackensen's army before it cut the rail line that linked Constan\u021ba with Bucharest. Fighting was furious, with attacks and counterattacks until September 23. The Bulgarian Third Army suffered a tactical defeat in the [[First Battle of Cobadin]] on September 19, forcing the Central Powers to halt their advance until mid-October. On 30 September, near the Romanian port of [[Sulina]], the German submarine ''[[SM UB-42|UB-42]]'' launched a torpedo at the Romanian torpedo boat {{NMS|Smeul|1888|6}}, but missed. The Romanian warship counterattacked, damaging the submarine's periscope and conning tower and forcing her to retreat.<ref>Constantin Cump\u0103n\u0103, Corina Apostoleanu, ''Amintiri despre o flota pierduta \u2013 vol.

On the next day, this area was expanded, with 8 Bulgarian settlements ending up in Romanian hands. However, due to the deteriorating situation in Transylvania, the offensive was cancelled on 3 October. The Austro-Hungarian river monitors ''Bodrog'', ''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'' and ''Szamos'', together with the patrol boat ''Barsch'' and one coal barge were damaged by Romanian coastal batteries and one large barge loaded with explosives was sunk. ''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'' took 12 hits and was disabled for the rest of the Romanian Campaign.\n\n===The counteroffensive of the Central Powers===\n[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|left|200px|French Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops]]\nOverall command was now under [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] (recently replaced as German Chief of Staff), who started his own counterattack on 18 September. The first attack was on the Romanian First Army near the town of [[Ha\u021beg]]; the attack halted the Romanian advance. Eight days later, German troops attacked [[Sibiu]], and on 29 September, the outnumbered Romanians began retreating to the [[Vulcan Pass|Vulcan]] and [[Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass|Turnu Ro\u0219u]] Passes. The latter, however, had been occupied by Bavarian mountain troops in a flanking movement, and the Battle of Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass ended with the Romanians retaking the pass at a cost of 3,000 men. On October 17, the Romanian Second Army attacked the Austro-Hungarians at [[Bra\u0219ov]], but the attack was repulsed and the counterattack forced the Romanians to retreat from there also. The [[Romanian Fourth Army]], in the north of the country, retreated without much pressure from the Austro-Hungarian troops, so that by 25 October, the Romanian army was back to its initial positions.<ref>Michael B. Barrett, ''Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania'' (Indiana U.P., 2013)</ref> The Central Powers succeeded in taking the strategic initiative in Transylvania by concentrating significant military forces rapidly brought in from the other theatres of operations in Europe and exploiting a quick shift of Romanian units to the battlefront in Dobruja.<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\n[[File:1916 - Respingerea unui atac austro-ungar - desen de I Bughardt.png|thumb|200px|right|Romanian troops repelling an Austro-Hungarian attack during the First Battle of Oituz, October 1916]]\nIn October 1916, the Romanian army mounted a wide-scale operation, the main target of which was the defense of the mountain passes in the Southern and Eastern Carpathians against the ever-stronger pressure of the German and Austro-Hungarian forces. Grim fights erupted in the [[Prahova Valley]], where occupation of the locality of [[Predeal]] was one of the major aims pursued by the Central Powers. Given their dramatic character, the clashes for the Predeal town and railway station were frequently compared with the heaviest fights on the Western Front. Similar fights took place in the [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]-[[C\u00e2mpulung]] area, especially at [[Dragoslavele]] and [[Raco\u0219]].<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\nParticular heed was paid to the actions carried on for the defense of the Carpathians' alignment, the [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|fights]] on the [[Jiu River]]. There, the Germans had massed large forces to beat their way south of the mountains. Faced with the enemy threat, the troops of the Romanian First Army, under command of General [[Ion Dragalina]], offered strong resistance. The Romanian soldiers were supported everywhere by the civil population; during the [[Jiu Bridge|Battle of T\u00e2rgu Jiu]], the town was defended by its inhabitants, men, women and children, young and old. There, a conspicuous figure was cut by [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]], who was to enter the consciousness of all Romanians as the \"Heroine of the Jiu\". The operation for the defense of the Carpathians holds a prominent place in Romanian military history not only because it was one of the most difficult operations waged by the Romanian army until then, but also because it was one of the most important as regards the complexity of the actions carried on and the highly valuable lessons derived from their evolution.<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\n[[File:Austrian 30.5 cm artillery and Rumanian prisoners.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Romanian prisoners of war passing by an Austro-Hungarian howitzer at the [[Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass]]]]\nAfter the Romanian troops were initially able to stop the German advance on the [[Jiu Valley]], the German army regrouped on 29 October 1916. The German High Command created the Army Group K\u00fchne, headquartered in [[Petro\u0219ani]], under the command of General [[Viktor K\u00fchne]] <small>([[:de:Viktor K\u00fchne|de]])</small>. This Army Group included the 11th and 301st Bavarian infantry divisions, which had previously fought the Romanians on the Jiu, the 41st Prussian and the 109th infantry divisions which were transferred from the [[Riga]] front as well as the newly formed [[V Cavalry Corps (German Empire)|58th Cavalry Corps (z.b.V)]] under the command of General [[Eberhard Graf von Schmettow|Egon von Schmettow]], which included the 6th and 7th cavalry divisions. The German reserves consisted of the 115th infantry division and two brigades of cyclists. The total manpower of the Army Group amounted to 80,000 troops with 30,000 horses. The Romanian forces could not withstand the new German attack which started on 1 November 1916. The Romanians retreated and on 21 November 1916 the German cavalry entered [[Craiova]]. The Romanian army continued its retreat towards the [[Olt River]] while the cavalry tried to slow the German advance in order to give it time to organize a defensive line along the Olt.  Although the Romanian army made attempts to stop the advance of the German forces, such as in the [[Battle of Rob\u0103ne\u0219ti]], these were largely unsuccessful.<ref>[http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/%C5%9Earja_de_la_Rob%C4%83ne%C5%9Fti - * * *  - \u015earja de la Rob\u0103ne\u015fti - Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei]</ref>\n\n[[File:General Toshev and Hilmi Pasha.jpg|thumb|200px|right|General [[Stefan Toshev|Toshev]] and Hilmi Pa\u015fa observing the fighting around [[Medgidia]]]]\n[[File:Romanian navy, 1914.png|thumb|left|Romanian Navy main warships: {{NMS|Elisabeta}} cruiser, ''N\u0103luca''-class torpedo boats (three), ''Siretul''-class gunboats (four), training ship ''Mircea'', ''[[Br\u0103tianu-class river monitor|Br\u0103tianu]]''-class river monitors (four), ''Alexandru cel Bun'' minelayer and armed liners]]\nBack on the coast, Field Marshal Mackensen and Bulgarian General [[Stefan Toshev]] launched a new offensive on 19 October, after a month of careful preparations, and achieved a decisive victory in the [[Second Battle of Cobadin]]. The Romanians and Russians were forced to withdraw out of [[Constan\u021ba]] (occupied by the Central Powers on 22 October). After the fall of [[Cernavod\u0103]], the defense of the unoccupied Dobruja was left only to the Russians, who were gradually pushed back towards the marshy [[Danube Delta]]. The Russian Army was now both demoralized and nearly out of supplies. Mackensen felt free to secretly pull a large number of troops back to the town of [[Svishtov]] in Bulgaria with an eye towards crossing the Danube river.\n\nIn mid-November, after several [[Battle of the Southern Carpathians|tactical defeats in the Southern Carpathians]] (Bran-C\u00e2mpulung, [[Battle of Predeal Pass|Prahova Valley]], [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|Jiu Valley]]), Falkenhayn concentrated his best troops (the elite ''[[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]'') in the south for an attack on the [[Vulcan Pass]]. The [[Second Battle of the Jiu Valley|Battle of Vulcan Pass]] was launched on 10 November.  One of the young officers was the future Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]. On 11 November, then-Lieutenant Rommel led the [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] Mountain Company in the capture of Mount Lescului.  The offensive pushed the Romanian defenders back through the mountains and into the plains by 26 November. There was already snow covering the mountains and soon operations would have to halt for the winter. Advances by other parts of Falkenhayn's [[9th Army (German Empire)|Ninth Army]] also pushed through the mountains; the Romanian army was being ground down by the constant battle and their supply situation was becoming critical.\n\nAfter conquering the main Romanian sea port of [[Constan\u021ba]] during the [[Second Battle of Cobadin]], the Germans set up a naval base which was used by German seaplanes for raids against [[Sulina]], the last Romanian-held sea port. On 7 November, Romanian anti-aircraft defenses at Sulina (including the old protected cruiser {{NMS|Elisabeta}}) shot down into the sea one of the seaplanes, killing the commander of the German squadron.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 199 (in Romanian)</ref> This reduced the German seaplane force at Constan\u021ba by a quarter, which only consisted of four aircraft in November 1916. The shot down seaplane was of the [[Friedrichshafen FF.33]] type, as these were the only German naval bombers on the Romanian front. In total, from 1916 to 1918, German seaplanes serving on the Romanian front were of three types: Friedrichshafen FF.33, [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.12]] and [[Rumpler 6B]].<ref>[https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/hidroscalele-germane-in-dobrogea-1916-1918 German seaplanes in Dobruja 1916-1918 (in Romanian)]</ref> In November, the German submarine ''[[SM UC-15|UC-15]]'' was sent on a minelaying mission off Sulina and never returned, being sunk by her own mines.<ref>R.H.

This attack caught the Romanians by surprise and Mackensen's army was able to advance rapidly towards Bucharest against very weak resistance. Mackensen's attack threatened to cut off half the Romanian army. In response, the Romanian Command prepared a counter-offensive known under the name of the [[Battle of the Arge\u015f]] (part of the [[Battle of Bucharest]]) and designated the recently promoted General [[Constantin Prezan]] to lead it. The plan envisaged the checking of the advance of the German Ninth Army from the north and north-west, as well as the encirclement and annihilation of the German-Bulgarian-Turkish units deployed south-east of Bucharest.<ref name=\"Romania831\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol.2, p. 831</ref> It was a bold undertaking, using the entire reserves of the Romanian army, but it needed the cooperation of Russian divisions to contain Mackensen's offensive while the Romanian reserve struck the gap between Mackensen and Falkenhayn. However, the Russian army would not endorse the plan and did not support the attack.\n\nOn 1 December, the Romanian army went ahead with the offensive along the [[Arge\u0219 River|Arge\u0219]] and [[Neajlov River|Neajlov]] rivers. Initially, the Romanians experienced success, taking a large number of prisoners, however Mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and Falkenhayn's forces responded with attacks at every point.<ref name=Baldwin85>Baldwin 1962, p. 85.</ref> Faced with the overwhelming superiority of the invading forces, the Romanian army, its ranks thinned from the previous actions, inferior in equipment and lacking Russian support, failed to check the enemy advance. Although it recorded numerous daring actions (among these the [[Prunaru Charge]], in which the 2nd Ro\u015fiori Cavalry Regiment was almost wiped out), the Battle of Arge\u015f ended unfavourably for the Romanian army.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/> Within three days, the attack had been shattered and the Romanians were retreating everywhere. Bucharest was captured on 6 December by Falkenhayn's cavalry. The Romanian Second Army made a fighting retreat to the [[Siret River|Siret]] river, which had originally been fortified against the Russians and was facing the wrong direction, but nevertheless would end up proving invaluable, protected as it was by the impassable Danube Delta to the southeast and a flank in the Carpathians in the northwest. Fierce fighting took place in the Battle of R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat between 22 and 26 December, with Mackensen's forces entering the town on 27 December. Around this time, the Russians began sending numerous reinforcements to [[Moldavia]] to prevent an invasion of southern Russia. Southern Romania, including [[Oltenia]], [[Muntenia]], [[Dobruja]] and southern Moldavia, was now in the hands of the Central Powers. While retreating, the Romanians burnt stores of grain and destroyed oil wells to prevent them from being used by the Germans.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/>\n\nOn 3 December, the Romanian river torpedo boat ''C\u0103pitan Valter M\u0103r\u0103cineanu'' was sunk on the Danube by a mine, 1 sailor was killed.<ref>Robert Gardiner, ''Conway's All the World Fighting Ships 1906-1921'', p. 422</ref><ref>Frederick Thomas Jane, ''Jane's Fighting Ships'', p. 485</ref>\n\nThe remaining Russo-Romanian forces in Dobruja abandoned [[M\u0103cin]] on 4 January 1917 and [[Br\u0103ila]] on 5 January 1917. Toward the end of the month, extreme frost gave the Bulgarians an opportunity to enter the [[Danube Delta]]. On 23 January, they attempted to cross the marshes at [[Tulcea]], but suffered heavy casualties to Romanian defenders on the northern bank and stopped. The Romanian Land Forces, supported by the Danube Division of the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]] and by the actions of the Romanian cruiser {{NMS|Elisabeta}} at the mouths of the [[Danube]], managed to prevent the Central Powers from advancing into the Danube Delta, keeping it under Romanian control until the end of the War.<ref>Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, ''World War I: Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', p. 999</ref><ref>''Warship International, Volume 21'', p. 166</ref> Fighting also ceased in the Carpathian passes, also owing to unfavorable weather. Mackensen's troops were able to capture [[Foc\u0219ani]] on 8 January, but an attempt to break the [[Siret River]] line on 19 January failed. Thus, the front stabilized and allowed for the Romanian army to be refitted and rebuilt.\n\nRomania entered the war at a time of strong crisis for the Entente, drawing upon itself numerous enemy forces, fighting on a very long battlefront and having to change its initial campaign plan permanently. But in spite of the human, material and military efforts made by the Central Powers throughout this period, they failed to achieve their fundamental political and strategic goal to defeat Romania and knock it out of the war. Despite heavy casualties, some 250,000 men (almost one third of the manpower mobilized in August 1916) compared to 105,000 Central Power casualties (including 60,000 Germans),<ref>Michael B. Barrett, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 295</ref> and losses of combat material, the Romanian army was still a force taken into consideration by allies and enemies alike and capable of offering resistance to further attacks. Part of the population moved to the free territory, together with the Romanian government, royal court and public authorities, which relocated to [[Ia\u0219i]]. Therefore, the Kingdom of Romania continued to exercise the attributes of an independent and sovereign state, allied to the Entente powers.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/>\n\n===Romanian recovery===\n[[File:Mortier Negrei 250 mm Model 1916.JPG|thumb|Romanian-made Negrei Model 1916 heavy mortar]]\n[[File:Gruson-53-mm-model-1916.jpg|thumb|[[Fahrpanzer]] 53 mm gun removed from its turret and installed on a Romanian-built gun carriage (thus made an infantry gun)]]\nIn 1917, when both belligerent sides were making huge efforts to win the final victory, for Romania it was vitally important for Romanians to expel the occupying forces, since the existence of the Romanian state depended on it. After the Romanian troops had managed to bring the enemy to a halt at Moldavia's Gates, on the [[Eastern Carpathians]], the [[Siret River]] and the [[Danube Delta]] alignment in cooperation with Russian military forces, Romania embarked on the reconstruction and strengthening of its combat capability during the first half of 1917 through multiple national efforts under highly complex international circumstances. Considerable measures were taken in all economic branches to rebuild the evacuated factories and workshops, increase the production destined for the national defense and the productivity yielded by the exploitation of the few petroleum and coal resources in the free zones. Agriculture received special attention to help meet basic nutritional needs and ensure a minimal living standard to the population in the free part of the country, and also to assist the refugees who had left their houses in front of the enemy invasion, the Romanian army and the Russian troops (who numbered about one million by early 1917).<ref name=\"Romania832\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 832</ref>\n\nWith a view to achieving the unity of action of internal political forces that was indispensable to safeguarding the nation's interests, a government of national union was set up in Ia\u015fi on 24 December 1916, led by [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]]. The political life in unoccupied territory adopted a fundamental goal to achieve national consensus to find the means to conclude a successful liberation war. Within this framework, debates on some laws envisaging structural transformations (primarily the agrarian reform to re-allocate land to peasants and the introduction of [[universal suffrage]]) responded to popular demands of the citizenry and contributed to the morale of the soldiers in the front lines.<ref name=\"Romania832\"/>\n\nThe Romanian army's reconstruction involved both re-organization and modernization. While the forces that had taken part in the big [[Battle of Bucharest]] (Army Group Prezan) were reshuffled inland, the Romanian Second Army, which had preserved its combat structures and force to a great extent, remained on the front in southern Moldavia, where, alongside Russian forces, it checked the enemy advance. The reorganization was initiated by King Ferdinand and the Romanian government. It was carried on under their leadership and control in the free national territory, in spite of Russian attempts to shift the Romanian army beyond the [[Dniester]], inside [[Ukraine]]. The re-organization pursued the reduction of the effectives of the \"Operations Army\" to parameters that suited the country's resources for waging a long campaign. The infantry divisions were ensured identical structure to make replacements and maneuvers easier on the battlefront and to have a fire power comparable with that of the enemy. The army corps became only a command body for tactical coordination. The cavalry divisions received more machine guns. The artillery material underwent a homogenization process, with two regiments (one cannon, the other howitzer) for each division, while the heavy artillery was organized as a distinct group.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 832-833</ref>\n\nThe re-organization also involved the other troops (combat engineers, air force, navy) and services, which underwent notable improvements. The directions, organization and methodology of the training of the command staff and the troops were considerably improved and special training centers were set up. Priority was given to [[trench warfare]], the assimilation of new military technology and night combat.<ref name=\"Romania833\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 833</ref>\n\nConsiderable progress was achieved with the technical-material equipment of the army by means of its provisioning with armament, ammunition and other combat resources from inside the country, but even more importantly from abroad. The Allies supported the maintenance of the Romanian front by continuing to deliver and supplement previously placed orders.<ref name=\"Romania833\"/> 150,000 French 8&nbsp;mm rifles, 1,760 [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun]]s, 197 [[Vickers machine gun]]s, 2,628 [[Chauchat]]s, 108 [[Lewis gun]]s, 1,3 million [[F1 grenade (France)|F1 grenades]], 84 [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897|Puteaux 75mm guns]], 72 long and 20 short de Bange 120&nbsp;mm guns, 28 [[BL 5-inch howitzer|Coventry 127 mm howitzers]], 14 [[Canon de 155 C mod\u00e8le 1915 St. Chamond|St. Chamond 155 mm]] and seven [[152 mm howitzer M1910|Schneider-Putilov 152,4 mm]] howitzers and 130 French [[Mortier de 58 mm type 2|58mm trench mortars]] arrived from Western Europe.<ref>{{in lang|ro}}lt.-colonel Alexandru Ioani\u0163iu, ''R\u0103zboiul Rom\u00e2niei (1916-1919)'', Bucharest, vol.

A notable contribution to the reconstruction of the Romanian army was made by the 1,600-strong [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|French military mission]] led by General [[Henri Mathias Berthelot]], which supervised the process and helped retrain Romanian troops. In early June 1917, the Romanian army's strength grew to about 700,000 men, organized in 207 infantry battalions plus 60 march battalions, 110 cavalry squadrons and 245 artillery batteries, divided among two armies and five corps. The results obtained in terms of re-organization and recovery impressed public opinion both at home and abroad and were to be confirmed in the great battles of the ensuing months.<ref name=\"Romania833\"/>\n\nIn January 1917, the Romanian river gunboat ''Sm\u00e2rdan'' was sunk by German shore artillery, 3 sailors were killed.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 196 (in Romanian)</ref> On April 16th, Easter Monday, the Romanian torpedo boat {{NMS|Smeul|1888|6}} capsized in rough seas off the mouth of the Danube with the loss of 18 of her crew, including 3 French naval officers present on board.<ref>Constantin Cump\u0103n\u0103, Corina Apostoleanu, ''Amintiri despre o flot\u0103 pierdut\u0103'', vol.

Its final form ready in late May 1917, the operations plan for the Romanian front called for the mounting of a general offensive in the [[Foc\u015fani]]-[[N\u0103moloasa]] sector with a view to completely pin down all enemy forces there, annihilate the main enemy groups operating there (the German Ninth Army) and support the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Dabija, Gheorghe, ''Armata rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een r\u0103zboiul mondial (1916-1918)'' (''The Romanian army during the world war (1916-1918)''), Bucharest, 1936, vol. 4, p. 31</ref> The decisive effort was to be made by the Romanian First Army. In order to increase the effect of the offensive and draw as many enemy troops as possible northwest of the town of Foc\u015fani, the actions of the Romanian Second and [[4th Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Fourth]] Armies had to precede those of the Romanian First Army. The German High Command, which had moved the center of gravity of its military operations to the Eastern Front in hopes of winning a victory there through the defeat of Romania and the conclusion of a peace with Russia, decided in June 1917 to mount a wide-scope offensive in the north and south of Moldavia, to which end it brought over reinforcements from the other fronts.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 833-834</ref>\n\nIn early July 1917, on the Romanian front, one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and war material assembled during World War I: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives amounted to some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]], represented a turning point in the war on the Eastern front. These battles were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.<ref name=\"Romania834\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 834</ref>\n\n[[File:CasinValley1917.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Romanian [[10.5 cm Feldhaubitze M.12|Model 1912 105 mm howitzer]] during the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]]]]\nThe [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]] began on 24 July 1917 at dawn, and took place in [[Vrancea County]] in the sector of the Romanian Second and Russian Fourth Armies. Initiated by surprise with three divisions, the offensive succeeded in disrupting the well-organized enemy defenses and compelling the Austro-Hungarians and Germans to retreat. By the evening, the Romanian divisions had conquered the first defenses, the strongest and deepest of the defensive system of the [[Friedrich von Gerok (officer)|Gerok Group]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian First Army]]) in the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti area. The next day, pursuing the offensive, the Romanian troops forced the enemy into an ever more disorderly retreat. This created favorable conditions for a deep penetration into the defensive disposition and the annihilation of the enemy group. However, under the circumstances in which the [[Stavka|Russian High Command]] decided unilaterally to stall any offensive as a result of the grave situation created on the front in Galicia and Bukovina following the failure of the Kerensky Offensive and the counter-attack of the Central Powers, the Romanian General Headquarters saw itself compelled to discontinue the offensive throughout the entire territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea. In the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti zone, however, the Romanian units continued the offensive until July 30 upon the request of their commander, General [[Alexandru Averescu]]. This marked the end of the Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti. It inflicted important losses upon the Austro-Hungarians and Germans, who relinquished a 35&nbsp;km-wide and 20&nbsp;km-deep area and sustained heavy casualties and losses in combat resources. The offensive potential of the Romanian army was confirmed through this victory.<ref name=\"Romania834\"/>\n\nThe salient created by the Romanian troops in the enemy lines at the junction between the Austro-Hungarian First Army and the German Ninth Army made the High Command of the Central Powers bring forces from other sectors on the Moldavian front and change the main direction of the offensive initially planned for the Foc\u015fani-N\u0103moloasa region. After the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti operation had been discontinued, the Central Powers tried to implement their offensive plan in the summer of 1917. They pursued to encircle and smash the Romanian and Russian forces through a blow dealt to the northwest in the direction of Foc\u015fani, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti and [[Adjud]], conjugated with another blow that had to start from the mountains through the [[Oituz River|Oituz]] and [[Trotu\u0219 River|Trotu\u0219]] valleys towards [[T\u00e2rgu Ocna]] and Adjud (the [[Second Battle of Oituz]]). Pursuing the offensive, the German troops aimed at occupying the whole of Moldavia, thereby knocking Romania out of the war, and, together with an in-depth penetration of the Austro-Hungarian troops on the front in Bukovina, to push the Russian forces eastwards, beyond [[Odessa]]. The offensive of the German Ninth Army, from the [[Army Group Mackensen (Romania)|Army Group Mackensen]], started on 6 August 1917, when the units of the Russian Fourth Army on the [[Siret River]] were expected to leave their positions to reinforce the front in the north of Moldavia and be replaced by the divisions of the Romanian First Army (commanded by General [[Constantin Cristescu]] until 12 August, then by General [[Eremia Grigorescu]]).<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 834-835</ref>\n\n[[File:Tropas-ruman\u00eda-fernando--rumaniassacrific00neguuoft.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Ferdinand of Romania|King Ferdinand]] decorating soldiers at the front]]\nFor 29 days, until 3 September, this sector was the scene of the most important battle fought by the Romanian army during the 1917 campaign. The Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti had three distinct stages. During the first stage (6-12 August), the troops of the Romanian First Army, together with Russian forces, managed to arrest the enemy advance and forced the Germans to change the direction of their attack toward the northwest gradually. In the second stage (13-19 August), the Romanian Command completely took over the command of the battle from the Russians. The confrontation reached its climax on August 19, with the result that enemy's attempts to advance were completely thwarted. The third stage (20 August - 3 September) actually saw the last German attempt at least to improve their positions in view of a new offensive, this one also confounded by the Romanian response.<ref name=\"Romania835\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 835</ref>\n\nStarting on 8 August 1917, the fighting on the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti front combined with an Austro-Hungarian-German offensive at Oituz. Holding out against superior enemy forces, the Romanian troops by 30 August stemmed the advance of the Gerok Group. The definitive cessation of the general offensive on the Romanian front by the Central Powers on 3 September 1917 marked a strategic defeat and a considerable weakening of their forces on the South-Eastern front. The response of the Romanian army in fact created the strongest blow to the Central Powers that was dealt in Eastern Europe in 1917.<ref name=\"Romania835\"/>\n\n[[File:River monitor Inn.png|thumb|left|SMS ''Inn'']]\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied. Nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops were tied down, and ''[[The Times]]'' was prompted to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".\n\nOn 22 September, Romania achieved its greatest naval success of the war, when the Austro-Hungarian river monitor [[Enns-class river monitor|SMS ''Inn'']] struck a Romanian mine and sank near Br\u0103ila, the explosion killing the chief of staff of the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla and a telegraphist and wounding 8 more sailors.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 215 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Angus Konstam, ''Gunboats of World War I'', p. 29</ref><ref>Ren\u00e9 Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref><ref>Mark Axworthy, Cornel I.

These events effectively ended Russian involvement in the war and left Romania isolated and surrounded by the Central Powers. It had little choice but to negotiate the [[Armistice of Foc\u0219ani|Foc\u0219ani Armistice]], signed by the combatants on 9 December 1917.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Treaty of Bucharest===\n[[File:RomanianPMMarghilomanSigningBucharestPeaceTreaty1918.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Alexandru Marghiloman]] signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1918]]\n{{Further information|Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romanian military intervention in Bessarabia|Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Second Romanian Campaign of World War I}}\n\nOn 7 May 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers. It imposed harsh conditions on the country, but recognized its union with Bessarabia. [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored prime minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty. The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n===Romania reenters the war, November 1918===\n{{Main article|Greater Romania|Union of Transylvania with Romania|Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Treaty of Trianon|Little Entente}}\n\nAfter the successful [[Vardar Offensive]] on the [[Macedonian front]] that knocked Bulgaria out of World War I in the autumn of 1918, Romania re-entered the war, again on the side of the Allies, on 10 November 1918, the day before it ended in Western Europe.\n\nOn 28 November 1918, the Romanian representatives of Bukovina voted for union with the Kingdom of Romania, followed by the proclamation of a [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] on 1 December 1918 by the representatives of Transylvanian Romanians gathered at [[Alba Iulia]], while the representatives of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] approved the act on 15 December at an assembly in [[Media\u0219]]. A similar gathering was held by the minority Hungarians in Cluj, on 22 December. They reaffirmed their allegiance to Hungary.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] recognized these proclamations under the right of national self-determination espoused in the [[Fourteen Points]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Germany agreed under the terms of the same treaty (Article 259) to renounce the benefits provided by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918.<ref>[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Articles_248_-_263 Articles 248 - 263 - World War I Document Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Romanian control of Transylvania, which had also a minority Hungarian-speaking population of 1,662,000 (31.6%, according to the [[Treaty of Trianon#Demographic consequences|census data]] of 1910), was widely resented in the new nation state of [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungary]]. This started the [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919]] between Romania and the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], which also waged [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918\u20131920)|parallel conflicts]] with [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].

Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf: Architect of the Apocalypse p.192</ref>\n\nIn his 1922 book, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', [[John Buchan]] provides a comprehensive analysis of the Romanian 1916 Campaign:\n<blockquote>Contemporary history is rarely just to failure. Only when the mists have cleared and the main issues have been decided can the belligerents afford to weigh each section of a campaign in a just scale. Rumania's entry into the war had awakened baseless hopes among her Allies; her unsuccess - her inexplicable unsuccess, as it seemed to many - was followed by equally baseless criticism and complaint. The truth is, that when Brussilov and Sarrail had once failed to achieve their purpose, her chances of victory were gone. She had attempted a strategic problem which only a wild freak of fortune could have permitted her to solve. Her numbers from the start were too small, too indifferently trained, and too weakly supplied with guns. Nevertheless, once she stood with her back to the wall, this little people, inexpert in war, made a stalwart resistance. Let justice be done to the fortitude of the Rumanian retreat. Her generals were quick to grasp the elements of danger, and by their defence of the central passes prevented the swift and utter disaster of which her enemies dreamed. After months of fighting, during which his armies lost heavily, Falkenhayn gained Wallachia and the capital; but the plunder was not a tithe of what he had hoped for. The Rumanian expedition was, let it be remembered, a foraging expedition in part of its purpose, and the provender secured was small. The ten weeks of the retreat were marked by conspicuous instances of Rumanian quality in the field, and the battles of Hermannstadt and the Striu valley, the defence of the Predeal, Torzburg, and Rotherthurm Passes, the first battle of Targul Jiu, and Presan's counter-stroke on the Argesh were achievements of which any army might be proud. And the staunch valor of the Roman legionaries still lived in the heroic band who, under Anastasiu, cut their way from Orsova to the Aluta.<ref>John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', pp. 253-254</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Erich Ludendorff]] summarized the end of the 1916 Romanian Campaign as follows:\n<blockquote>We had beaten the Rumanian Army; to annihilate it had proved impossible. We had done all that was possible, but found ourselves obliged to leave forces in the Dobrudja and Wallachia which we had been able to use on the Eastern and Western fronts and in Macedonia before Rumania came into the war. In spite of our victory over the Rumanian Army, we were definitely weaker as regards the conduct of the war as a whole.<ref>Erich Ludendorff, Harper & brothers, 1919, ''Ludendorff's own story, Volume 1'', pp. 358-359</ref></blockquote> \n\nThe failure of the Romanian front for the Entente was also the result of several factors beyond Romania's control. The failed [[Macedonian front|Salonika Offensive]] did not meet the expectation of Romania's \"guaranteed security\" from Bulgaria.<ref>Torrey, Romania and World War I, p. 27</ref> This proved to be a critical strain on Romania's ability to wage a successful offensive in Transylvania, as it needed to divert troops south to the defense of Dobruja.<ref>Istoria Rom\u00e2niei, Vol. IV, p. 366</ref> Furthermore, Russian reinforcements in Romania did not materialize to the number of 200,000 soldiers initially demanded.<ref>Torrey, Romania and World War I, p. 65</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"270\">\nImage:Romania-WW1-1.jpg|Romanian invasion of Austria-Hungary, August 1916\nImage:Romania-WW1-2.jpg|Central Powers counterattack, September\u2013October 1916\nImage:Romania-WW1-3.jpg|Operations in Romania, November 1916 to January 1917\nFile:1916 - Austria - Luptele din Dobrogea 19 octombire-11 noiembrie 1916.png|Operations in Dobruja, October 19 to November 11, 1916\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War I}}\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I#Romania]]\n* [[Romanian Navy during World War I]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Barrett, Michael B.

It had the most significant oil fields in Europe, and Germany eagerly bought its petroleum, as well as food exports. \n\n[[Carol I of Romania|King Carol]] favored Germany but after his death in 1914, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] and the nation's political elite favored the Entente. For Romania, the highest priority was taking [[Transylvania]] from Hungary, with around 2,800,000 Romanians out of 5,000,000 people. [[Allies of World War I|The Allies]] wanted Romania to join its side in order to cut the rail communications between Germany and Turkey, and to cut off Germany's oil supplies.\n\nBritain made loans, France sent a [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|military training mission]], and Russia promised modern munitions. The Allies promised at least 200,000 soldiers to defend Romania against Bulgaria to the south, and help it invade Austria.\n\nThe '''Romanian campaign''' was part of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War I]], with [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] allied with Britain and France against the [[Central Powers]] of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. Fighting took place from August 1916 to December 1917 across most of present-day Romania, including [[Transylvania]], which was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the time, as well as in [[Southern Dobruja]], which is currently part of [[Bulgaria]].\n\nThe Romanian Campaign Plan (The \"Z\" Hypothesis) consisted in attacking [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria-Hungary]] in Transylvania, while defending Southern Dobruja and [[Giurgiu County|Giurgiu]] from Bulgaria in the south. Despite initial successes in Transylvania, after German divisions started aiding Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, the Romanian forces (aided by Russia) suffered massive setbacks, and by the end of 1916 out of the territory of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] only [[Western Moldavia]] remained under the control of the Romanian and Russian armies.\n\nAfter several defensive victories in 1917 at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]], with Russia's withdrawal from the war following the [[October Revolution]], Romania, almost completely surrounded by the Central Powers, was also forced to drop out of the war, it signed the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers in May 1918. The parliament signed the treaty, however [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] refused to sign it hoping for an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory on the western front. On 10 November 1918, just one day before the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|German armistice]] and after all the other Central Powers had already capitulated, Romania re-entered the war after the successful Allied advances on the [[Macedonian front]].\n\n==Before the war==\n[[File:A Vlaicu III 03.png|thumb|Romanian [[A Vlaicu III|Vlaicu III]] monoplane, built just prior to [[World War I]]]]\n[[File:1915 - Scut de tran\u015fee construit la Atelierele CFR.PNG|thumb|Gun [[mantlet]] built at Atelierele CFR]]\nThe Kingdom of Romania was ruled by kings of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] from 1866. In 1883, the [[King of Romania]], [[Carol I of Hohenzollern]], signed a secret treaty with the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] that stipulated Romania's obligation to go to war only in the event that Austria-Hungary was attacked. While Carol wanted to enter World War I as an ally of the Central Powers, the Romanian public and the political parties were in favor of joining the [[Triple Entente]].\n\nRomania remained neutral when the war started, arguing that Austria-Hungary itself had started the war and, consequently, Romania was under no formal obligation to join it.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwcWDFZWuJgC&pg=PA102 |title=Brief Romanian Military History |author-first=C\u0103lin |author-last=Hentea |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=102 |isbn=9780810858206}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&pg=PA208 |title=A Companion to World War I |author-first=Jean-Jacques|author-last=Becker |chapter=Chapter Fourteen: War Aims and Neutrality |editor-first=John |editor-last=Horne |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=208 |isbn=9781405123860}}</ref> At the same time, Germany started encouraging Austro-Hungary to make territorial concessions to Romania and Italy in order to keep both states neutral.<ref name=\"Herwig2014\">{{cite book|author=Holger H.

The Romanians' greatest concerns in negotiations were the avoidance of a conflict that would have to be fought on two fronts (one in [[Dobruja]] with [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgaria]] and one in Transylvania) and written guarantees of Romanian territorial gains after the war. They demanded an agreement not to make a separate peace with the Central Powers, equal status at the future peace conference, Russian military assistance against Bulgaria, an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] offensive in the direction of Bulgaria, and the regular shipment of Allied war supplies. The military convention they signed with the Allies stipulated that [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] should start an offensive against Bulgaria and the [[Ottoman Empire]] no later than August 1916, that Russia would send troops into Dobruja, and that the Romanian army would not be subordinated to Russian command. The Allies were to send 300 tons of provisions on a daily basis. According to the Romanian account, most of these clauses, with the exception of those imposed on Romania, failed to be respected.<ref>Marcel Mitrasca, ''Moldova: A Romanian Province under Russian Rule. Diplomatic History from the Archives of the Great Powers'', pg. 56</ref>\n\nThe Allies accepted the terms late in the summer of 1916 (''see [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1916]]''); [[Cyril Falls]] attributes the late decision to Romania's historical hostility towards the Russian Empire and purports that an earlier entry into the war, perhaps before the [[Brusilov Offensive]] the same year, would have provided better chance for victory.<ref>Cyril Falls, ''The Great War'' p. 228</ref> According to some American military historians, Russia delayed approval of Romanian demands out of worries about Romanian territorial designs on Bessarabia, claimed by nationalist circles as a Romanian land.<ref>Vincent Esposito, ''Atlas of American Wars, Vol 2'', text for map 37</ref> According to British military historian [[John Keegan]], before Romania entered the war, the Allies had secretly agreed not to honour the territorial expansion of Romania when the war ended.<ref>John Keegan, ''The First World War'', pg. 306</ref>\n[[File:Afi\u0219-247x300.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sketch pleading for the entry of Romania into war against Austria-Hungary in order to create [[Greater Romania]] (''Ilustra\u0163iunea'' magazine, November 1915)]]\n[[File:WWI Poster Rumania.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] poster, welcoming Romania's decision to join the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente]]]]\nIn 1915, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|Christopher Thomson]], a fluent speaker of French, was sent to Bucharest as British military attach\u00e9 on the initiative of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to bring Romania into the war. Once there, he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on two fronts would be a liability, not an asset, to the Allies. This view was brushed aside by [[Whitehall]], and Thomson signed a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916. Within a few months, he had to alleviate the consequences of Romania's setbacks and supervise the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to Germany.<ref>''To Ride the Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101'' by Sir Peter G.

The Romanian ambassador in Vienna actually transmitted the declaration of war on 27 August. Germany, caught by surprise, responded with a declaration of war on Romania the next day (28 August). The dates of the Bulgarian and Ottoman declarations of war are disputed. Ian Beckett says that Bulgaria did not issue a declaration of war prior to its attack of 31 August.<ref>Ian F. W.

Meanwhile, the German Chief of Staff, General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], had correctly reasoned that Romania would side with the Allies, and had made plans accordingly. Thanks to the earlier conquest of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the ineffective Allied operations on the [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] border (the [[Salonica campaigns]]), and having a territorial interest in Dobruja, the [[Bulgarian Army]] and the [[Ottoman Army]] were willing to help fight the Romanians.\n\nThe German high command was seriously worried about the prospect of Romania entering the war, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] writing:\n\n<blockquote>It is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage.<ref>Paul von Hindenburg, Out of My Life, Vol. I, trans. F.A.

Although most Transylvanian Romanians were loyal to the Empire, over time, reactionary sentiments emerged, especially after Romania joined the war. Many of the previously loyal soldiers decided that it was much better to risk their lives through desertion, rather than shoot their ethnical conationals. Many novels have been written on this subject, including Liviu Rebreanu's [[Forest_of_the_Hanged_(novel)|Forest of the Hanged]]. Romanian troops fought on all European fronts of the Dual Monarchy, some of them being distinguished, such as [[Hauptmann]] (''C\u0103pitan'') [[Gheorghe Flondor]] and [[Second lieutenant|Leutnant]] (''Locotenent'') [[Emil Rebreanu]].

[[Samoil\u0103 M\u00e2rza]], a private in the Austro-Hungarian Army, reached as far as Riga and became the first Romanian war photographer. In total, up to 150,000 Romanians were killed in action while fighting as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army.<ref>Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow.

In areas populated with Romanians, the Romanian troops were warmly welcomed, and the locals provided them considerable assistance in terms of provisions, billeting and guiding.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 829</ref> However, the rapid Romanian advance alarmed the Central Powers, and within weeks sizable reinforcements began arriving at the scene. The Entente incorrectly assumed that Germany would be unable to respond to the invasion, as the [[Battle of the Somme]] and the [[Brusilov Offensive]] were at their height around this time and tied down significant German forces. Nevertheless, eight divisions and an Alpine Corps were deployed under the command of [[Erich von Falkenhayn]]. The Austro-Hungarians also sent four divisions to reinforce their lines, and by the middle of September, the Romanian offensive was halted. A separate Romanian offensive, carried out by the 1st Infantry Division, was much more limited in its aims and it succeeded: [[Battle of Orsova|capturing]] the west bank of the [[Cerna (Danube)|Cerna River]] within the [[Banat]] region. The Romanian occupation of the area lasted for over two months, until mid-November. \n\nWhile the Romanian Army was advancing in Transylvania, the first counterattack came from Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] in command of a multi-national force composed of the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]], a German brigade and two divisions of the [[VI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman VI Army Corps]], whose units began arriving on the [[Dobrudja]] front after the initial battles.<ref>''\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1915 - 1918, vol.

The Romanian garrison of [[Turtucaia]], encircled by Bulgarian troops (aided by a column of German troops) surrendered on September 6 at the conclusion of the [[Battle of Turtucaia]]. The Romanian Third Army made further attempts to withstand the enemy offensive at [[Silistra]], [[Battle of Dobrich|Dobrich]], [[Amzacea]] and [[Topraisar]], but had to withdraw under the pressure of superior enemy forces. Mackensen's success was favoured by the failure of the Allies to fulfill the obligation they had assumed through the military convention, by virtue of which they had to mount an offensive on the Macedonian front and the conditions in which the Russians deployed insufficient troops on the battlefront in the south-east of Romania. These factors meant that the Romanian forces became too strained to put up effective resistance against the enemy advance. Romania had to fight on two 1,600&nbsp;km-long battlefronts, the longest front in Europe, with a varied configuration and diverse geographical elements (by comparison, the Russian front, stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Bukovina]], was only 1,000&nbsp;km long).<ref name=\"Romania830\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 830</ref>\n\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-c\u00e1rpatos--rumaniassacrific00neguuoft.png|thumb|right|150px|Romanian troops in Transylvania, 1916]]\nOn September 15, the Romanian War Council decided to suspend the Transylvania offensive and concentrate on the Mackensen army group instead. The plan (the so-called ''[[Fl\u0103m\u00e2nda Offensive]]'') was to attack the Central Powers forces from the rear by crossing the Danube at [[Fl\u0103m\u00e2nda]], while the front-line Romanian and Russian forces were supposed to launch an offensive southwards towards [[Cobadin]] and [[Kurtbunar]]. Russian reinforcements under General [[Andrei Zaionchkovsky]] arrived to halt Mackensen's army before it cut the rail line that linked Constan\u021ba with Bucharest. Fighting was furious, with attacks and counterattacks until September 23. The Bulgarian Third Army suffered a tactical defeat in the [[First Battle of Cobadin]] on September 19, forcing the Central Powers to halt their advance until mid-October. On 30 September, near the Romanian port of [[Sulina]], the German submarine ''[[SM UB-42|UB-42]]'' launched a torpedo at the Romanian torpedo boat {{NMS|Smeul|1888|6}}, but missed. The Romanian warship counterattacked, damaging the submarine's periscope and conning tower and forcing her to retreat.<ref>Constantin Cump\u0103n\u0103, Corina Apostoleanu, ''Amintiri despre o flota pierduta \u2013 vol.

On the next day, this area was expanded, with 8 Bulgarian settlements ending up in Romanian hands. However, due to the deteriorating situation in Transylvania, the offensive was cancelled on 3 October. The Austro-Hungarian river monitors ''Bodrog'', ''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'' and ''Szamos'', together with the patrol boat ''Barsch'' and one coal barge were damaged by Romanian coastal batteries and one large barge loaded with explosives was sunk. ''K\u00f6r\u00f6s'' took 12 hits and was disabled for the rest of the Romanian Campaign.\n\n===The counteroffensive of the Central Powers===\n[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|left|200px|French Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops]]\nOverall command was now under [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] (recently replaced as German Chief of Staff), who started his own counterattack on 18 September. The first attack was on the Romanian First Army near the town of [[Ha\u021beg]]; the attack halted the Romanian advance. Eight days later, German troops attacked [[Sibiu]], and on 29 September, the outnumbered Romanians began retreating to the [[Vulcan Pass|Vulcan]] and [[Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass|Turnu Ro\u0219u]] Passes. The latter, however, had been occupied by Bavarian mountain troops in a flanking movement, and the Battle of Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass ended with the Romanians retaking the pass at a cost of 3,000 men. On October 17, the Romanian Second Army attacked the Austro-Hungarians at [[Bra\u0219ov]], but the attack was repulsed and the counterattack forced the Romanians to retreat from there also. The [[Romanian Fourth Army]], in the north of the country, retreated without much pressure from the Austro-Hungarian troops, so that by 25 October, the Romanian army was back to its initial positions.<ref>Michael B. Barrett, ''Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania'' (Indiana U.P., 2013)</ref> The Central Powers succeeded in taking the strategic initiative in Transylvania by concentrating significant military forces rapidly brought in from the other theatres of operations in Europe and exploiting a quick shift of Romanian units to the battlefront in Dobruja.<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\n[[File:1916 - Respingerea unui atac austro-ungar - desen de I Bughardt.png|thumb|200px|right|Romanian troops repelling an Austro-Hungarian attack during the First Battle of Oituz, October 1916]]\nIn October 1916, the Romanian army mounted a wide-scale operation, the main target of which was the defense of the mountain passes in the Southern and Eastern Carpathians against the ever-stronger pressure of the German and Austro-Hungarian forces. Grim fights erupted in the [[Prahova Valley]], where occupation of the locality of [[Predeal]] was one of the major aims pursued by the Central Powers. Given their dramatic character, the clashes for the Predeal town and railway station were frequently compared with the heaviest fights on the Western Front. Similar fights took place in the [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]-[[C\u00e2mpulung]] area, especially at [[Dragoslavele]] and [[Raco\u0219]].<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\nParticular heed was paid to the actions carried on for the defense of the Carpathians' alignment, the [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|fights]] on the [[Jiu River]]. There, the Germans had massed large forces to beat their way south of the mountains. Faced with the enemy threat, the troops of the Romanian First Army, under command of General [[Ion Dragalina]], offered strong resistance. The Romanian soldiers were supported everywhere by the civil population; during the [[Jiu Bridge|Battle of T\u00e2rgu Jiu]], the town was defended by its inhabitants, men, women and children, young and old. There, a conspicuous figure was cut by [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]], who was to enter the consciousness of all Romanians as the \"Heroine of the Jiu\". The operation for the defense of the Carpathians holds a prominent place in Romanian military history not only because it was one of the most difficult operations waged by the Romanian army until then, but also because it was one of the most important as regards the complexity of the actions carried on and the highly valuable lessons derived from their evolution.<ref name=\"Romania830\"/>\n\n[[File:Austrian 30.5 cm artillery and Rumanian prisoners.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Romanian prisoners of war passing by an Austro-Hungarian howitzer at the [[Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass]]]]\nAfter the Romanian troops were initially able to stop the German advance on the [[Jiu Valley]], the German army regrouped on 29 October 1916. The German High Command created the Army Group K\u00fchne, headquartered in [[Petro\u0219ani]], under the command of General [[Viktor K\u00fchne]] <small>([[:de:Viktor K\u00fchne|de]])</small>. This Army Group included the 11th and 301st Bavarian infantry divisions, which had previously fought the Romanians on the Jiu, the 41st Prussian and the 109th infantry divisions which were transferred from the [[Riga]] front as well as the newly formed [[V Cavalry Corps (German Empire)|58th Cavalry Corps (z.b.V)]] under the command of General Egon von Schmettow, which included the 6th and 7th cavalry divisions. The German reserves consisted of the 115th infantry division and two brigades of cyclists. The total manpower of the Army Group amounted to 80,000 troops with 30,000 horses. The Romanian forces could not withstand the new German attack which started on 1 November 1916. The Romanians retreated and on 21 November 1916 the German cavalry entered [[Craiova]]. The Romanian army continued its retreat towards the [[Olt River]] while the cavalry tried to slow the German advance in order to give it time to organize a defensive line along the Olt.  Although the Romanian army made attempts to stop the advance of the German forces, such as in the [[Battle of Rob\u0103ne\u0219ti]], these were largely unsuccessful.<ref>[http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/%C5%9Earja_de_la_Rob%C4%83ne%C5%9Fti - * * *  - \u015earja de la Rob\u0103ne\u015fti - Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei]</ref>\n\n[[File:General Toshev and Hilmi Pasha.jpg|thumb|200px|right|General [[Stefan Toshev|Toshev]] and Hilmi Pa\u015fa observing the fighting around [[Medgidia]]]]\n[[File:Romanian navy, 1914.png|thumb|left|Romanian Navy main warships: {{NMS|Elisabeta}} cruiser, ''N\u0103luca''-class torpedo boats (three), ''Siretul''-class gunboats (four), training ship ''Mircea'', ''[[Br\u0103tianu-class river monitor|Br\u0103tianu]]''-class river monitors (four), ''Alexandru cel Bun'' minelayer and armed liners]]\nBack on the coast, Field Marshal Mackensen and Bulgarian General [[Stefan Toshev]] launched a new offensive on 19 October, after a month of careful preparations, and achieved a decisive victory in the [[Second Battle of Cobadin]]. The Romanians and Russians were forced to withdraw out of [[Constan\u021ba]] (occupied by the Central Powers on 22 October). After the fall of [[Cernavod\u0103]], the defense of the unoccupied Dobruja was left only to the Russians, who were gradually pushed back towards the marshy [[Danube Delta]]. The Russian Army was now both demoralized and nearly out of supplies. Mackensen felt free to secretly pull a large number of troops back to the town of [[Svishtov]] in Bulgaria with an eye towards crossing the Danube river.\n\nIn mid-November, after several [[Battle of the Southern Carpathians|tactical defeats in the Southern Carpathians]] (Bran-C\u00e2mpulung, [[Battle of Predeal Pass|Prahova Valley]], [[First Battle of the Jiu Valley|Jiu Valley]]), Falkenhayn concentrated his best troops (the elite ''[[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]'') in the south for an attack on the [[Vulcan Pass]]. The [[Second Battle of the Jiu Valley|Battle of Vulcan Pass]] was launched on 10 November.  One of the young officers was the future Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]. On 11 November, then-Lieutenant Rommel led the [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] Mountain Company in the capture of Mount Lescului.  The offensive pushed the Romanian defenders back through the mountains and into the plains by 26 November. There was already snow covering the mountains and soon operations would have to halt for the winter. Advances by other parts of Falkenhayn's [[9th Army (German Empire)|Ninth Army]] also pushed through the mountains; the Romanian army was being ground down by the constant battle and their supply situation was becoming critical.\n\nAfter conquering the main Romanian sea port of [[Constan\u021ba]] during the [[Second Battle of Cobadin]], the Germans set up a naval base which was used by German seaplanes for raids against [[Sulina]], the last Romanian-held sea port. On 7 November, Romanian anti-aircraft defenses at Sulina (including the old protected cruiser {{NMS|Elisabeta}}) shot down into the sea one of the seaplanes, killing the commander of the German squadron.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 199 (in Romanian)</ref> This reduced the German seaplane force at Constan\u021ba by a quarter, which only consisted of four aircraft in November 1916. The shot down seaplane was of the [[Friedrichshafen FF.33]] type, as these were the only German naval bombers on the Romanian front. In total, from 1916 to 1918, German seaplanes serving on the Romanian front were of three types: Friedrichshafen FF.33, [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.12]] and [[Rumpler 6B]].<ref>[https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/hidroscalele-germane-in-dobrogea-1916-1918 German seaplanes in Dobruja 1916-1918 (in Romanian)]</ref> In November, the German submarine ''[[SM UC-15|UC-15]]'' was sent on a minelaying mission off Sulina and never returned, being sunk by her own mines.<ref>R.H.

This attack caught the Romanians by surprise and Mackensen's army was able to advance rapidly towards Bucharest against very weak resistance. Mackensen's attack threatened to cut off half the Romanian army. In response, the Romanian Command prepared a counter-offensive known under the name of the [[Battle of the Arge\u015f]] (part of the [[Battle of Bucharest]]) and designated the recently promoted General [[Constantin Prezan]] to lead it. The plan envisaged the checking of the advance of the German Ninth Army from the north and north-west, as well as the encirclement and annihilation of the German-Bulgarian-Turkish units deployed south-east of Bucharest.<ref name=\"Romania831\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol.2, p. 831</ref> It was a bold undertaking, using the entire reserves of the Romanian army, but it needed the cooperation of Russian divisions to contain Mackensen's offensive while the Romanian reserve struck the gap between Mackensen and Falkenhayn. However, the Russian army would not endorse the plan and did not support the attack.\n\nOn 1 December, the Romanian army went ahead with the offensive along the [[Arge\u0219 River|Arge\u0219]] and [[Neajlov River|Neajlov]] rivers. Initially, the Romanians experienced success, taking a large number of prisoners, however Mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and Falkenhayn's forces responded with attacks at every point.<ref name=Baldwin85>Baldwin 1962, p. 85.</ref> Faced with the overwhelming superiority of the invading forces, the Romanian army, its ranks thinned from the previous actions, inferior in equipment and lacking Russian support, failed to check the enemy advance. Although it recorded numerous daring actions (among these the [[Prunaru Charge]], in which the 2nd Ro\u015fiori Cavalry Regiment was almost wiped out), the Battle of Arge\u015f ended unfavourably for the Romanian army.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/> Within three days, the attack had been shattered and the Romanians were retreating everywhere. Bucharest was captured on 6 December by Falkenhayn's cavalry. The Romanian Second Army made a fighting retreat to the [[Siret River|Siret]] river, which had originally been fortified against the Russians and was facing the wrong direction, but nevertheless would end up proving invaluable, protected as it was by the impassable Danube Delta to the southeast and a flank in the Carpathians in the northwest. Fierce fighting took place in the Battle of R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat between 22 and 26 December, with Mackensen's forces entering the town on 27 December. Around this time, the Russians began sending numerous reinforcements to [[Moldavia]] to prevent an invasion of southern Russia. Southern Romania, including [[Oltenia]], [[Muntenia]], [[Dobruja]] and southern Moldavia, was now in the hands of the Central Powers. While retreating, the Romanians burnt stores of grain and destroyed oil wells to prevent them from being used by the Germans.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/>\n\nOn 3 December, the Romanian river torpedo boat ''C\u0103pitan Valter M\u0103r\u0103cineanu'' was sunk on the Danube by a mine, 1 sailor was killed.<ref>Robert Gardiner, ''Conway's All the World Fighting Ships 1906-1921'', p. 422</ref><ref>Frederick Thomas Jane, ''Jane's Fighting Ships'', p. 485</ref>\n\nThe remaining Russo-Romanian forces in Dobruja abandoned [[M\u0103cin]] on 4 January 1917 and [[Br\u0103ila]] on 5 January 1917. Toward the end of the month, extreme frost gave the Bulgarians an opportunity to enter the [[Danube Delta]]. On 23 January, they attempted to cross the marshes at [[Tulcea]], but suffered heavy casualties to Romanian defenders on the northern bank and stopped. The Romanian Land Forces, supported by the Danube Division of the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]] and by the actions of the Romanian cruiser {{NMS|Elisabeta}} at the mouths of the [[Danube]], managed to prevent the Central Powers from advancing into the Danube Delta, keeping it under Romanian control until the end of the War.<ref>Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, ''World War I: Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', p. 999</ref><ref>''Warship International, Volume 21'', p. 166</ref> Fighting also ceased in the Carpathian passes, also owing to unfavorable weather. Mackensen's troops were able to capture [[Foc\u0219ani]] on 8 January, but an attempt to break the [[Siret River]] line on 19 January failed. Thus, the front stabilized and allowed for the Romanian army to be refitted and rebuilt.\n\nRomania entered the war at a time of strong crisis for the Entente, drawing upon itself numerous enemy forces, fighting on a very long battlefront and having to change its initial campaign plan permanently. But in spite of the human, material and military efforts made by the Central Powers throughout this period, they failed to achieve their fundamental political and strategic goal to defeat Romania and knock it out of the war. Despite heavy casualties, some 250,000 men (almost one third of the manpower mobilized in August 1916) compared to 105,000 Central Power casualties (including 60,000 Germans),<ref>Michael B.

Part of the population moved to the free territory, together with the Romanian government, royal court and public authorities, which relocated to [[Ia\u0219i]]. Therefore, the Kingdom of Romania continued to exercise the attributes of an independent and sovereign state, allied to the Entente powers.<ref name=\"Romania831\"/>\n\n===Romanian recovery===\n[[File:Mortier Negrei 250 mm Model 1916.JPG|thumb|Romanian-made Negrei Model 1916 heavy mortar]]\n[[File:Gruson-53-mm-model-1916.jpg|thumb|[[Fahrpanzer]] 53 mm gun removed from its turret and installed on a Romanian-built gun carriage (thus made an infantry gun)]]\nIn 1917, when both belligerent sides were making huge efforts to win the final victory, for Romania it was vitally important for Romanians to expel the occupying forces, since the existence of the Romanian state depended on it. After the Romanian troops had managed to bring the enemy to a halt at Moldavia's Gates, on the [[Eastern Carpathians]], the [[Siret River]] and the [[Danube Delta]] alignment in cooperation with Russian military forces, Romania embarked on the reconstruction and strengthening of its combat capability during the first half of 1917 through multiple national efforts under highly complex international circumstances. Considerable measures were taken in all economic branches to rebuild the evacuated factories and workshops, increase the production destined for the national defense and the productivity yielded by the exploitation of the few petroleum and coal resources in the free zones. Agriculture received special attention to help meet basic nutritional needs and ensure a minimal living standard to the population in the free part of the country, and also to assist the refugees who had left their houses in front of the enemy invasion, the Romanian army and the Russian troops (who numbered about one million by early 1917).<ref name=\"Romania832\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 832</ref>\n\nWith a view to achieving the unity of action of internal political forces that was indispensable to safeguarding the nation's interests, a government of national union was set up in Ia\u015fi on 24 December 1916, led by [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]]. The political life in unoccupied territory adopted a fundamental goal to achieve national consensus to find the means to conclude a successful liberation war. Within this framework, debates on some laws envisaging structural transformations (primarily the agrarian reform to re-allocate land to peasants and the introduction of [[universal suffrage]]) responded to popular demands of the citizenry and contributed to the morale of the soldiers in the front lines.<ref name=\"Romania832\"/>\n\nThe Romanian army's reconstruction involved both re-organization and modernization. While the forces that had taken part in the big [[Battle of Bucharest]] (Army Group Prezan) were reshuffled inland, the Romanian Second Army, which had preserved its combat structures and force to a great extent, remained on the front in southern Moldavia, where, alongside Russian forces, it checked the enemy advance. The reorganization was initiated by King Ferdinand and the Romanian government. It was carried on under their leadership and control in the free national territory, in spite of Russian attempts to shift the Romanian army beyond the [[Dniester]], inside [[Ukraine]]. The re-organization pursued the reduction of the effectives of the \"Operations Army\" to parameters that suited the country's resources for waging a long campaign. The infantry divisions were ensured identical structure to make replacements and maneuvers easier on the battlefront and to have a fire power comparable with that of the enemy. The army corps became only a command body for tactical coordination. The cavalry divisions received more machine guns. The artillery material underwent a homogenization process, with two regiments (one cannon, the other howitzer) for each division, while the heavy artillery was organized as a distinct group.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 832-833</ref>\n\nThe re-organization also involved the other troops (combat engineers, air force, navy) and services, which underwent notable improvements. The directions, organization and methodology of the training of the command staff and the troops were considerably improved and special training centers were set up. Priority was given to [[trench warfare]], the assimilation of new military technology and night combat.<ref name=\"Romania833\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 833</ref>\n\nConsiderable progress was achieved with the technical-material equipment of the army by means of its provisioning with armament, ammunition and other combat resources from inside the country, but even more importantly from abroad. The Allies supported the maintenance of the Romanian front by continuing to deliver and supplement previously placed orders.<ref name=\"Romania833\"/> 150,000 French 8&nbsp;mm rifles, 1,760 [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun]]s, 197 [[Vickers machine gun]]s, 2,628 [[Chauchat]]s, 108 [[Lewis gun]]s, 1,3 million [[F1 grenade (France)|F1 grenades]], 84 [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897|Puteaux 75mm guns]], 72 long and 20 short de Bange 120&nbsp;mm guns, 28 [[BL 5-inch howitzer|Coventry 127 mm howitzers]], 14 [[Canon de 155 C mod\u00e8le 1915 St. Chamond|St. Chamond 155 mm]] and seven [[152 mm howitzer M1910|Schneider-Putilov 152,4 mm]] howitzers and 130 French [[Mortier de 58 mm type 2|58mm trench mortars]] arrived from Western Europe.<ref>{{in lang|ro}}lt.-colonel Alexandru Ioani\u0163iu, ''R\u0103zboiul Rom\u00e2niei (1916-1919)'', Bucharest, vol.

A notable contribution to the reconstruction of the Romanian army was made by the 1,600-strong [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|French military mission]] led by General [[Henri Mathias Berthelot]], which supervised the process and helped retrain Romanian troops. In early June 1917, the Romanian army's strength grew to about 700,000 men, organized in 207 infantry battalions plus 60 march battalions, 110 cavalry squadrons and 245 artillery batteries, divided among two armies and five corps. The results obtained in terms of re-organization and recovery impressed public opinion both at home and abroad and were to be confirmed in the great battles of the ensuing months.<ref name=\"Romania833\"/>\n\nIn January 1917, the Romanian river gunboat ''Sm\u00e2rdan'' was sunk by German shore artillery, 3 sailors were killed.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 196 (in Romanian)</ref> On April 16th, Easter Monday, the Romanian torpedo boat {{NMS|Smeul|1888|6}} capsized in rough seas off the mouth of the Danube with the loss of 18 of her crew, including 3 French naval officers present on board.<ref>Constantin Cump\u0103n\u0103, Corina Apostoleanu, ''Amintiri despre o flot\u0103 pierdut\u0103'', vol.

Its final form ready in late May 1917, the operations plan for the Romanian front called for the mounting of a general offensive in the [[Foc\u015fani]]-[[N\u0103moloasa]] sector with a view to completely pin down all enemy forces there, annihilate the main enemy groups operating there (the German Ninth Army) and support the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Dabija, Gheorghe, ''Armata rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een r\u0103zboiul mondial (1916-1918)'' (''The Romanian army during the world war (1916-1918)''), Bucharest, 1936, vol. 4, p. 31</ref> The decisive effort was to be made by the Romanian First Army. In order to increase the effect of the offensive and draw as many enemy troops as possible northwest of the town of Foc\u015fani, the actions of the Romanian Second and [[4th Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Fourth]] Armies had to precede those of the Romanian First Army. The German High Command, which had moved the center of gravity of its military operations to the Eastern Front in hopes of winning a victory there through the defeat of Romania and the conclusion of a peace with Russia, decided in June 1917 to mount a wide-scope offensive in the north and south of Moldavia, to which end it brought over reinforcements from the other fronts.<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 833-834</ref>\n\nIn early July 1917, on the Romanian front, one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and war material assembled during World War I: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives amounted to some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]], represented a turning point in the war on the Eastern front. These battles were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.<ref name=\"Romania834\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 834</ref>\n\n[[File:CasinValley1917.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Romanian [[10.5 cm Feldhaubitze M.12|Model 1912 105 mm howitzer]] during the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]]]]\nThe [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]] began on 24 July 1917 at dawn, and took place in [[Vrancea County]] in the sector of the Romanian Second and Russian Fourth Armies. Initiated by surprise with three divisions, the offensive succeeded in disrupting the well-organized enemy defenses and compelling the Austro-Hungarians and Germans to retreat. By the evening, the Romanian divisions had conquered the first defenses, the strongest and deepest of the defensive system of the [[Friedrich von Gerok (officer)|Gerok Group]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian First Army]]) in the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti area. The next day, pursuing the offensive, the Romanian troops forced the enemy into an ever more disorderly retreat. This created favorable conditions for a deep penetration into the defensive disposition and the annihilation of the enemy group. However, under the circumstances in which the [[Stavka|Russian High Command]] decided unilaterally to stall any offensive as a result of the grave situation created on the front in Galicia and Bukovina following the failure of the Kerensky Offensive and the counter-attack of the Central Powers, the Romanian General Headquarters saw itself compelled to discontinue the offensive throughout the entire territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea. In the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti zone, however, the Romanian units continued the offensive until July 30 upon the request of their commander, General [[Alexandru Averescu]]. This marked the end of the Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti. It inflicted important losses upon the Austro-Hungarians and Germans, who relinquished a 35&nbsp;km-wide and 20&nbsp;km-deep area and sustained heavy casualties and losses in combat resources. The offensive potential of the Romanian army was confirmed through this victory.<ref name=\"Romania834\"/>\n\nThe salient created by the Romanian troops in the enemy lines at the junction between the Austro-Hungarian First Army and the German Ninth Army made the High Command of the Central Powers bring forces from other sectors on the Moldavian front and change the main direction of the offensive initially planned for the Foc\u015fani-N\u0103moloasa region. After the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti operation had been discontinued, the Central Powers tried to implement their offensive plan in the summer of 1917. They pursued to encircle and smash the Romanian and Russian forces through a blow dealt to the northwest in the direction of Foc\u015fani, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti and [[Adjud]], conjugated with another blow that had to start from the mountains through the [[Oituz River|Oituz]] and [[Trotu\u0219 River|Trotu\u0219]] valleys towards [[T\u00e2rgu Ocna]] and Adjud (the [[Second Battle of Oituz]]). Pursuing the offensive, the German troops aimed at occupying the whole of Moldavia, thereby knocking Romania out of the war, and, together with an in-depth penetration of the Austro-Hungarian troops on the front in Bukovina, to push the Russian forces eastwards, beyond [[Odessa]]. The offensive of the German Ninth Army, from the [[Army Group Mackensen (Romania)|Army Group Mackensen]], started on 6 August 1917, when the units of the Russian Fourth Army on the [[Siret River]] were expected to leave their positions to reinforce the front in the north of Moldavia and be replaced by the divisions of the Romanian First Army (commanded by General [[Constantin Cristescu]] until 12 August, then by General [[Eremia Grigorescu]]).<ref>Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, pp. 834-835</ref>\n\n[[File:Tropas-ruman\u00eda-fernando--rumaniassacrific00neguuoft.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Ferdinand of Romania|King Ferdinand]] decorating soldiers at the front]]\nFor 29 days, until 3 September, this sector was the scene of the most important battle fought by the Romanian army during the 1917 campaign. The Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti had three distinct stages. During the first stage (6-12 August), the troops of the Romanian First Army, together with Russian forces, managed to arrest the enemy advance and forced the Germans to change the direction of their attack toward the northwest gradually. In the second stage (13-19 August), the Romanian Command completely took over the command of the battle from the Russians. The confrontation reached its climax on August 19, with the result that enemy's attempts to advance were completely thwarted. The third stage (20 August - 3 September) actually saw the last German attempt at least to improve their positions in view of a new offensive, this one also confounded by the Romanian response.<ref name=\"Romania835\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 835</ref>\n\nStarting on 8 August 1917, the fighting on the M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti front combined with an Austro-Hungarian-German offensive at Oituz. Holding out against superior enemy forces, the Romanian troops by 30 August stemmed the advance of the Gerok Group. The definitive cessation of the general offensive on the Romanian front by the Central Powers on 3 September 1917 marked a strategic defeat and a considerable weakening of their forces on the South-Eastern front. The response of the Romanian army in fact created the strongest blow to the Central Powers that was dealt in Eastern Europe in 1917.<ref name=\"Romania835\"/>\n\n[[File:River monitor Inn.png|thumb|left|SMS ''Inn'']]\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied. Nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops were tied down, and ''[[The Times]]'' was prompted to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".\n\nOn 22 September, Romania achieved its greatest naval success of the war, when the Austro-Hungarian river monitor [[Enns-class river monitor|SMS ''Inn'']] struck a Romanian mine and sank near Br\u0103ila, the explosion killing the chief of staff of the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla and a telegraphist and wounding 8 more sailors.<ref>Raymond St\u0103nescu, Cristian Cr\u0103ciunoiu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een primul r\u0103zboi mondial'', p. 215 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Angus Konstam, ''Gunboats of World War I'', p. 29</ref><ref>Ren\u00e9 Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref><ref>Mark Axworthy, Cornel I.

These events effectively ended Russian involvement in the war and left Romania isolated and surrounded by the Central Powers. It had little choice but to negotiate the [[Armistice of Foc\u0219ani|Foc\u0219ani Armistice]], signed by the combatants on 9 December 1917.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Treaty of Bucharest===\n[[File:RomanianPMMarghilomanSigningBucharestPeaceTreaty1918.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Alexandru Marghiloman]] signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1918]]\n{{Further information|Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romanian military intervention in Bessarabia|Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Second Romanian Campaign of World War I}}\n\nOn 7 May 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers. It imposed harsh conditions on the country, but recognized its union with Bessarabia. [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored prime minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty. The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n===Romania reenters the war, November 1918===\n{{Main article|Greater Romania|Union of Transylvania with Romania|Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Treaty of Trianon|Little Entente}}\n\nAfter the successful [[Vardar Offensive]] on the [[Macedonian front]] that knocked Bulgaria out of World War I in the autumn of 1918, Romania re-entered the war, again on the side of the Allies, on 10 November 1918, the day before it ended in Western Europe.\n\nOn 28 November 1918, the Romanian representatives of Bukovina voted for union with the Kingdom of Romania, followed by the proclamation of a [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] on 1 December 1918 by the representatives of Transylvanian Romanians gathered at [[Alba Iulia]], while the representatives of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] approved the act on 15 December at an assembly in [[Media\u0219]]. A similar gathering was held by the minority Hungarians in Cluj, on 22 December. They reaffirmed their allegiance to Hungary.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] recognized these proclamations under the right of national self-determination espoused in the [[Fourteen Points]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Germany agreed under the terms of the same treaty (Article 259) to renounce the benefits provided by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918.<ref>[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Articles_248_-_263 Articles 248 - 263 - World War I Document Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Romanian control of Transylvania, which had also a minority Hungarian-speaking population of 1,662,000 (31.6%, according to the [[Treaty of Trianon#Demographic consequences|census data]] of 1910), was widely resented in the new nation state of [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungary]].

Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf: Architect of the Apocalypse p.192</ref>\n\nIn his 1922 book, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', [[John Buchan]] provides a comprehensive analysis of the Romanian 1916 Campaign:\n<blockquote>Contemporary history is rarely just to failure. Only when the mists have cleared and the main issues have been decided can the belligerents afford to weigh each section of a campaign in a just scale. Rumania's entry into the war had awakened baseless hopes among her Allies; her unsuccess - her inexplicable unsuccess, as it seemed to many - was followed by equally baseless criticism and complaint. The truth is, that when Brussilov and Sarrail had once failed to achieve their purpose, her chances of victory were gone. She had attempted a strategic problem which only a wild freak of fortune could have permitted her to solve. Her numbers from the start were too small, too indifferently trained, and too weakly supplied with guns. Nevertheless, once she stood with her back to the wall, this little people, inexpert in war, made a stalwart resistance. Let justice be done to the fortitude of the Rumanian retreat. Her generals were quick to grasp the elements of danger, and by their defence of the central passes prevented the swift and utter disaster of which her enemies dreamed. After months of fighting, during which his armies lost heavily, Falkenhayn gained Wallachia and the capital; but the plunder was not a tithe of what he had hoped for. The Rumanian expedition was, let it be remembered, a foraging expedition in part of its purpose, and the provender secured was small. The ten weeks of the retreat were marked by conspicuous instances of Rumanian quality in the field, and the battles of Hermannstadt and the Striu valley, the defence of the Predeal, Torzburg, and Rotherthurm Passes, the first battle of Targul Jiu, and Presan's counter-stroke on the Argesh were achievements of which any army might be proud. And the staunch valor of the Roman legionaries still lived in the heroic band who, under Anastasiu, cut their way from Orsova to the Aluta.<ref>John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, ''A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres'', pp. 253-254</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Erich Ludendorff]] summarized the end of the 1916 Romanian Campaign as follows:\n<blockquote>We had beaten the Rumanian Army; to annihilate it had proved impossible. We had done all that was possible, but found ourselves obliged to leave forces in the Dobrudja and Wallachia which we had been able to use on the Eastern and Western fronts and in Macedonia before Rumania came into the war. In spite of our victory over the Rumanian Army, we were definitely weaker as regards the conduct of the war as a whole.<ref>Erich Ludendorff, Harper & brothers, 1919, ''Ludendorff's own story, Volume 1'', pp. 358-359</ref></blockquote> \n\nThe failure of the Romanian front for the Entente was also the result of several factors beyond Romania's control. The failed [[Macedonian front|Salonika Offensive]] did not meet the expectation of Romania's \"guaranteed security\" from Bulgaria.<ref>Torrey, Romania and World War I, p. 27</ref> This proved to be a critical strain on Romania's ability to wage a successful offensive in Transylvania, as it needed to divert troops south to the defense of Dobruja.<ref>Istoria Rom\u00e2niei, Vol. IV, p. 366</ref> Furthermore, Russian reinforcements in Romania did not materialize to the number of 200,000 soldiers initially demanded.<ref>Torrey, Romania and World War I, p. 65</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"270\">\nImage:Romania-WW1-1.jpg|Romanian invasion of Austria-Hungary, August 1916\nImage:Romania-WW1-2.jpg|Central Powers counterattack, September\u2013October 1916\nImage:Romania-WW1-3.jpg|Operations in Romania, November 1916 to January 1917\nFile:1916 - Austria - Luptele din Dobrogea 19 octombire-11 noiembrie 1916.png|Operations in Dobruja, October 19 to November 11, 1916\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War I}}\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I#Romania]]\n* [[Romanian Navy during World War I]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Barrett, Michael B.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|date=July 2001|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought in the First to the Fourth Centuries==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|isbn=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

He says Justin writes only to answer objections his friends are facing and to defend these friends from ill treatment and even death.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose. After 320, Constantine continuously supported the Christian church with his patronage, had a number of [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, he required the still largely pagan government \"to foot the bill\"<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> which led to the closure of some pagan temples due to a lack of support.<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref><ref>MacMullan 1984: 141, Note 35 to Chapter V; Theophanes, ''Chron.'' a. 322 (PG 108.117)</ref>  He thereby began a \"political theology\" which had varying effects on different Christian thought of the period.  He called the Council of Nicea to resolve the Arian controversy without violence using exile as punishment but not persecution. \n\nDuring the course of his life, Constantine progressively became more Christian and turned away from any syncretic tendencies he appeared to favour at times, thus demonstrating, according to some of his biographers, that \"The God of the Christians was indeed a jealous God who tolerated no other gods beside him.

The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The first official execution for heresy was ordered by the King of the Franks at Orleans in 1022 at popular insistence. In 1076, Pope Gregory VI excommunicated the residents of the entire town of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a \u2018heretic\u2019 there. In 1034, \"the nobles of Milan insisted that the heretics from Montforte must be burned, against the (formal?) protest of the Archbishop.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|108}} In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons imprisoned some heretics, left to go ask the advice of the holy synod on what to do with them, and while he was gone, the town\u2019s folk, fearing what they termed the \u201chabitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics\u201d (clericalem verens mollitiem), stormed the prison, took the accused outside of town, and burned them alive. Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse.

Clergy understood that ordinary people often had uninformed and mistaken beliefs. The official response to that was not to designate them heretics but to simply correct them through ''persuasio.''

The label ''Inquisition'' is problematic as it implies \"an institutional coherence and official unity that never existed in the Middle Ages.\"<ref name =\"Deane\"/>{{rp|6}}  Church law was just developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to the degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of Inquisition when it seemed Germanic law had failed. <ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges being brought. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The first official execution for heresy was ordered by the King of the Franks at Orleans in 1022 at popular insistence. In 1076, Pope Gregory VI excommunicated the residents of the entire town of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a \u2018heretic\u2019 there. In 1034, \"the nobles of Milan insisted that the heretics from Montforte must be burned, against the (formal?) protest of the Archbishop.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|108}} In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons imprisoned some heretics, left to go ask the advice of the holy synod on what to do with them, and while he was gone, the town\u2019s folk, fearing what they termed the \u201chabitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics\u201d (clericalem verens mollitiem), stormed the prison, took the accused outside of town, and burned them alive. Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse. Roger Moore disagrees saying that all these, and other instances like them, have in common is dispute over jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|109}}\n\nThe dissemination of popular heresy ''to the laity'' was a new problem for the bishops of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, since heresy had previously been an accusation made solely toward Bishops and other church leaders who knew and understood theology.  The collection of ecclesiastical law from [[Burchard of Worms]] around 1002 did not include the concept of popular heresy at all.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|23}}. Clergy understood that ordinary people often had uninformed and mistaken beliefs. The official response to that was not to designate them heretics but to simply correct them through ''persuasio.''  If correction was rejected, the church had, by the end of the eleventh century, evolved a definition of heresy as the \"deliberate rejection of the truth.\"<ref name =\"Deane\">{{cite book|last=Deane|first = Jennifer Kolpacoff|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|ISBN=978-0-7425-5575-4}}</ref>{{rp|3-4}}.  \n\nWhile there were acts of violence in response to heresy undertaken by secular powers for their own reasons, Christian thought concerning response, at least at the beginning of the High Middle Ages, still tended to coincide with [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] who said reports of heresy should be investigated, true heretics excommunicated, and their teachings publicly rebuked.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|22,23}}  \"Through most of the previous millenium, instances of prosecution had been rare and spasmodic.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony of [[Rhode Island]], \"a haven for persecuted minorities,\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> [[John Locke]] drafted the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] and [[William Penn]] drew up the constitution of Pennsylvania. Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy. The Perils and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century.'' p. 104</ref> Compared to Europe, \"the United States has a superabundance of denominations and sects (...) as well as a far higher ratio of churchgoers.\"<ref name=\"Phillips06-105\">Kevin Phillips (2006): <!--''American Theocracy.

For political commentator [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]], \"few questions will be more important to the twenty-first-century United States than whether renascent religion and its accompanying hubris will be carried on the nation's books as an asset or as a liability.\"<ref name=\"Phillips06-99\">Kevin Phillips (2006): <!--''American Theocracy. The Perils and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century.'' p.--> 99.</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2008 survey, 65% of US-American Christians believe that many religions can lead to eternal life.<ref name=\"PEWForum08-1\">{{cite web|publisher=PEW Forum|date=December 18, 2008|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=380|title=Many Americans Say Other Faiths Can Lead to Eternal Life}}</ref> 52% of US-American Christians think that at least some non-Christian faiths can lead to eternal life.<ref name=\"PEWForum08-1\"/>\n\n(At its surface, the percentages above seem contradictory; the key is in the appellation of the term non-Christian in the second, lesser quantity. For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color [[dinnerware]] in the US.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the decoration of [[dinnerware]] and [[kitchenware]] [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] was still inspired by the [[Victorian era]], based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same [[decal]] designs.  With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public. The forms and surfaces expressed an [[Art Deco]] influence. At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray.  A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter.<ref name=huxford/>  The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer.  But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAs an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n<blockquote>\"COLOR!  that's the trend today ...\" and it went on to say, \"It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it's FUN to set a table with Fiesta!\" </blockquote>\n\nThe Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line. During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers. In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items.  At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower [[vase]]s in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, [[Decanter|carafes]], [[teapot]]s in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters.  In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.\n\nWith [[World War II]] and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined.  Beginning in 1942, the Fiesta line of items began to be reduced. Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were being discontinued, and by 1946, the line's variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third.  Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948.  The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized [[art deco]] shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing. From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad.  The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on [[auction|auction websites]] and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.\n\n==1936\u20131969==\nThe line name and design is still owned by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] of [[Newell, West Virginia|Newell]], [[West Virginia]], which was the original company that produced and marketed it. Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969.  As home decorating color styles changed, the company changed the solid color glazes.  The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque.  This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell.  The ware sometimes shows \" glaze curtains\", areas of uneven glazing where a heavy application meets a lighter one.\n\nAt its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: Red (orange red), Blue (cobalt), Green (light green), Yellow (deep golden), and Old Ivory (yellowish cream). By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: Turquoise ([[American robin|robin]]'s egg blue). With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until approximately 1950. The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).\n\nThe discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States' participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s. Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued and those by 1938. These early discontinued items, such as covered onion soup bowls in turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.\n\nBy 1950, home decorating styles and colors had changed.  The Homer Laughlin Company discontinued some original glaze colors and replaced them with four new colors.  The original Blue (cobalt), the original Green (light green), and the original Old Ivory (yellowish cream) were discontinued, replaced by Rose (dark pink), Gray (medium), Forest (dark green), and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).  Two existing glaze colors, Yellow and Turquoise, were retained, allowing the company to offer six colors through the 1950s.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, sales had again dropped.  The company reduced its offering of items and changed the glaze colors.  By 1959 the United States government had released its block on [[uranium]], which enabled the Homer Laughlin Company to produce the original bright orange-red glaze again (see below). The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of a new green color and the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the yellow and turquoise colors made up the four glaze colors offered from 1959 through 1969.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the company always referred to the new color simply as Green in its brochures, collectors later called it Medium Green, to distinguish it from other green glazes which the company had produced.  The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green.  Some have described it as a \"[[List of John Deere tractors|John Deere Tractor]]\" green.  Beginning in 1959, Fiesta was available in the following colors: Red (original orange red), Green (new Medium green), Yellow (original golden), and Turquoise (original robin's egg blue).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959\u20131969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen.  The newest shade of green is in very short supply{{according to whom?|date=September 2019}} on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors.  It has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta. Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta's production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969. Red, while an original color at the line's introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below).  Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued.  Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production.  While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the \"Original 6\" or \"Fifties Colors\".\n\n==Radioactive glazes==\n[[File:FiestaWare Velleman-K2645 GeigerCounter.ogv|thumb|right|[[Geiger counter]] (kit without housing) audibly reacting to an orange Fiestaware shard.]]\n\nBrilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of [[uranium oxide]] in its [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], which produced the orange-red [[color]].<ref>''Radon, Health and Natural Hazards'', Editors: G.K.

The anchor narrating the segment passes a radiation measuring tool over several products including the Antique/Vintage Fiesta plate that was produced nearly 70 years ago. The narrator also stated that it was taken off the market because when people heard about the uranium in the glaze, they did not want to buy the product. In fact, The Homer Laughlin China Company stopped manufacturing all Fiestaware in 1972 because of low sales. The product that was used within the segment has been discontinued and has not available for close to 40 years time. Fiesta today is frequently tested by federally licensed independent laboratories and is lead free, microwave/dishwasher safe, oven proof and made in the USA ...\n \nPrior to World War II, it was common practice for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in color glazes. The Homer Laughlin China Company was no exception, using this material in the original \"Fiesta Red\" glaze, among others.\n \nIn 1943, the U.S. Government stopped all civilian use of uranium oxide because available supplies were needed for the war effort. Homer Laughlin stopped producing the red glaze color at that time and for that reason. Nonetheless, this interruption in production is believed to be the source of the rumor that Fiesta's red glaze was removed from the market because it was radioactive. In truth, the red glaze emitted far less radiation than some other consumer products. Following the lifting of wartime restrictions, Homer Laughlin again began producing the red glaze in the 1950s, using a depleted grade of uranium oxide.\n \nHomer Laughlin stopped all use of depleted uranium oxide in 1972 and it is not used in Fiesta Dinnerware which is produced today.}}\n\n==1969\u20131973==\nBy 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed.  The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it.  Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance.  The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces.  These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes. Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red.  Replacing  Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors. One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular [[Avocado]] color of the day.  The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era.  The line's name was changed to \"Fiesta Ironstone\".  The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta's  popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.\n\n==Decaled and decorated Fiesta shapes==\nAs is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names.  Throughout its long life (1936\u20131973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation.  One example was \"Fiesta Casuals\", which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.\n\nAs another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark 'bean-pot' brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze 'Mediterranean-style' geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as \"Amberstone\" in a supermarket promotion.  Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze.  This line was dubbed \"Casualstone\" for another supermarket promotion.\n\n==Collectors and the secondary market==\nDuring the 1970s, a new appreciation for [[Art Deco]] designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished. Along with this, the [[baby boomers]] were establishing their own households.  They made Fiesta popular once again.  Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular [[garage sale]]s. Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions.  Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed.  By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding nearly a hundred U.S. [[dollar]]s for scarcer items.  By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher.  Certain pieces and colors were being traded for hundreds of dollars.\n\n==Contemporary Fiesta from 1986 ==\n[[File:Fiesta ware fiesta.jpg|thumb|A display of Fiesta]]\nThe [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] noticed the activity on the secondary market.  After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction.  Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969\u20131973). The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable.  Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay.  Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller.  In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.\n\nIn 1986, Laughlin offered five colors:\n*Rose (pink) (1986\u20132005) [This color changed significantly in the post-2000 firings but was still considered the same Rose],\n*Black (black) (1986\u20132015),\n*Cobalt (dark navy blue) (1986\u2013),\n*White (bright stark white) (1986\u2013),\n*Apricot (pale pinkish tan) (1986\u20131998).\n\nThe glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the original Fiesta.  Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular.  In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines.  Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers.  Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment.  Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new [[collectible]].  The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the  collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames.  Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.<ref>Curtis, Wayne. \"[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/2/2004_2_66.shtml China Town]\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', April/May 2004.</ref>\n\nLaughlin has produced new Fiesta in a total of 34 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta.  As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s.

Sapphire was sold exclusively at [[Bloomingdale's]] from 1996 to 1997.  In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate.  The color of [[milk chocolate]], the new shade adds a second neutral tone to Fiesta's color palette.  It was available for a limited period of time and in a limited number of pieces.\n\nIn 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of [[dinnerware]] carrying the name Fiesta produced by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] since 1936.  In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold.  In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in [[Chicago]], Illinois.  This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen.  Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011\u20132012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Fiesta 75th Anniversary!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an indication of its influence, Fiesta was featured in a design exhibit at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum in [[New York City]] in 1988.\n\n===Square Fiesta dinnerware===\nIn 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced.  Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories. \nDespite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company's established 'round' deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand's signature concentric rings.\n\nIn October 2016, Fiesta announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923).\n<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/squarerelease.htm Square Fiesta Dinnerware<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n''[[American Fiesta]]'', a one-man play written and performed by [[Steven Tomlinsoni]], refers to the central character's obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite news\n  | title = A Nation Bound by Colorful Dinnerware\n  | publisher = The New York Times, Ginia Bellafante, April 28, 2007\n  | url = http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/theater/reviews/28fies.html\n| date=April 28, 2007\n| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bauer Pottery]]\n*[[Franciscan Ceramics]]\n*[[Metlox]]\n*[[Pacific Clay]]\n*[[Sencer Sari]]\n*[[Uranium glass]]\n*[[Uranium tile]]\n*[[Vernon Kilns]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rowe, Willyum.

However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color [[dinnerware]] in the US.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the decoration of [[dinnerware]] and [[kitchenware]] [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] was still inspired by the [[Victorian era]], based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same [[decal]] designs.  With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public. The forms and surfaces expressed an [[Art Deco]] influence. At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray.  A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter.<ref name=huxford/>  The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer.  But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAs an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n<blockquote>\"COLOR!  that's the trend today ...\" and it went on to say, \"It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it's FUN to set a table with Fiesta!\" </blockquote>\n\nThe Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line. During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers. In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items.  At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower [[vase]]s in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, [[Decanter|carafes]], [[teapot]]s in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters.  In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.\n\nWith [[World War II]] and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined.  Beginning in 1942, the Fiesta line of items began to be reduced. Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were being discontinued, and by 1946, the line's variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third.  Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948.  The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized [[art deco]] shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing. From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad.  The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on [[auction|auction websites]] and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.\n\n==1936\u20131969==\nThe line name and design is still owned by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] of [[Newell, West Virginia|Newell]], [[West Virginia]], which was the original company that produced and marketed it. Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969.  As home decorating color styles changed, the company changed the solid color glazes.  The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque.  This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell.  The ware sometimes shows \" glaze curtains\", areas of uneven glazing where a heavy application meets a lighter one.\n\nAt its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: Red (orange red), Blue (cobalt), Green (light green), Yellow (deep golden), and Old Ivory (yellowish cream). By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: Turquoise ([[American robin|robin]]'s egg blue). With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until approximately 1950. The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).\n\nThe discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States' participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s. Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued and those by 1938. These early discontinued items, such as covered onion soup bowls in turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.\n\nBy 1950, home decorating styles and colors had changed.  The Homer Laughlin Company discontinued some original glaze colors and replaced them with four new colors.  The original Blue (cobalt), the original Green (light green), and the original Old Ivory (yellowish cream) were discontinued, replaced by Rose (dark pink), Gray (medium), Forest (dark green), and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).  Two existing glaze colors, Yellow and Turquoise, were retained, allowing the company to offer six colors through the 1950s.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, sales had again dropped.  The company reduced its offering of items and changed the glaze colors.  By 1959 the United States government had released its block on [[uranium]], which enabled the Homer Laughlin Company to produce the original bright orange-red glaze again (see below). The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of a new green color and the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the yellow and turquoise colors made up the four glaze colors offered from 1959 through 1969.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the company always referred to the new color simply as Green in its brochures, collectors later called it Medium Green, to distinguish it from other green glazes which the company had produced.  The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green.  Some have described it as a \"[[List of John Deere tractors|John Deere Tractor]]\" green.  Beginning in 1959, Fiesta was available in the following colors: Red (original orange red), Green (new Medium green), Yellow (original golden), and Turquoise (original robin's egg blue).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959\u20131969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen.  The newest shade of green is in very short supply{{according to whom?|date=September 2019}} on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors.  It has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta. Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta's production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969. Red, while an original color at the line's introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below).  Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued.  Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production.  While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the \"Original 6\" or \"Fifties Colors\".\n\n==Radioactive glazes==\n[[File:FiestaWare Velleman-K2645 GeigerCounter.ogv|thumb|right|[[Geiger counter]] (kit without housing) audibly reacting to an orange Fiestaware shard.]]\n\nBrilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of [[uranium oxide]] in its [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], which produced the orange-red [[color]].<ref>''Radon, Health and Natural Hazards'', Editors: G.K.

The anchor narrating the segment passes a radiation measuring tool over several products including the Antique/Vintage Fiesta plate that was produced nearly 70 years ago. The narrator also stated that it was taken off the market because when people heard about the uranium in the glaze, they did not want to buy the product. In fact, The Homer Laughlin China Company stopped manufacturing all Fiestaware in 1972 because of low sales. The product that was used within the segment has been discontinued and has not available for close to 40 years time. Fiesta today is frequently tested by federally licensed independent laboratories and is lead free, microwave/dishwasher safe, oven proof and made in the USA ...\n \nPrior to World War II, it was common practice for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in color glazes. The Homer Laughlin China Company was no exception, using this material in the original \"Fiesta Red\" glaze, among others.\n \nIn 1943, the U.S. Government stopped all civilian use of uranium oxide because available supplies were needed for the war effort. Homer Laughlin stopped producing the red glaze color at that time and for that reason. Nonetheless, this interruption in production is believed to be the source of the rumor that Fiesta's red glaze was removed from the market because it was radioactive. In truth, the red glaze emitted far less radiation than some other consumer products. Following the lifting of wartime restrictions, Homer Laughlin again began producing the red glaze in the 1950s, using a depleted grade of uranium oxide.\n \nHomer Laughlin stopped all use of depleted uranium oxide in 1972 and it is not used in Fiesta Dinnerware which is produced today.}}\n\n==1969\u20131973==\nBy 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed.  The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it.  Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance.  The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces.  These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes. Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red.  Replacing  Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors. One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular [[Avocado]] color of the day.  The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era.  The line's name was changed to \"Fiesta Ironstone\".  The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta's  popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.\n\n==Decaled and decorated Fiesta shapes==\nAs is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names.  Throughout its long life (1936\u20131973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation.  One example was \"Fiesta Casuals\", which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.\n\nAs another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark 'bean-pot' brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze 'Mediterranean-style' geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as \"Amberstone\" in a supermarket promotion.  Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze.  This line was dubbed \"Casualstone\" for another supermarket promotion.\n\n==Collectors and the secondary market==\nDuring the 1970s, a new appreciation for [[Art Deco]] designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished. Along with this, the [[baby boomers]] were establishing their own households.  They made Fiesta popular once again.  Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular [[garage sale]]s. Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions.  Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed.  By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding nearly a hundred U.S. [[dollar]]s for scarcer items.  By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher.  Certain pieces and colors were being traded for hundreds of dollars.\n\n==Contemporary Fiesta from 1986 ==\n[[File:Fiesta ware fiesta.jpg|thumb|A display of Fiesta]]\nThe [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] noticed the activity on the secondary market.  After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction.  Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969\u20131973). The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable.  Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay.  Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller.  In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.\n\nIn 1986, Laughlin offered five colors:\n*Rose (pink) (1986\u20132005) [This color changed significantly in the post-2000 firings but was still considered the same Rose],\n*Black (black) (1986\u20132015),\n*Cobalt (dark navy blue) (1986\u2013),\n*White (bright stark white) (1986\u2013),\n*Apricot (pale pinkish tan) (1986\u20131998).\n\nThe glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the original Fiesta.  Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular.  In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines.  Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers.  Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment.  Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new [[collectible]].  The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the  collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames.  Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.<ref>Curtis, Wayne. \"[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/2/2004_2_66.shtml China Town]\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', April/May 2004.</ref>\n\nLaughlin has produced new Fiesta in a total of 34 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta.  As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s.  In addition to the first five glazes, the names of the new color glazes, in order of introduction, are:\n*Yellow (pale custard/butter) (1987\u20132002),\n*Turquoise (more greenish than vintage Turquoise) (1988\u2013),\n*Periwinkle (slightly lavenderish-blue) (1989\u20132006),\n*Sea Mist (pale mint green) (1991\u20132005),\n*Lilac (soft purple) (1993\u20131995),\n*Persimmon (pinkish-orange) (1995\u20132008),\n*Sapphire (medium bright blue) (Bloomingdale's exclusive 1996\u20131997),\n*Chartreuse (brighter and greener than vintage Chartreuse) (1997\u20131999),\n*Pearl Gray (light gray) (1999\u20132001),\n*Juniper (dark bluish-green) (1999\u20132001),\n*Cinnabar (brownish-burgundy) (2000\u20132010),\n*Sunflower (bright yellow) (2001\u2013),\n*Plum (dark purple) (2002\u20132016),\n*Shamrock (bright deep green) (2002\u2013),\n*Tangerine (bright orange) (2003\u20132018),\n*Scarlet (deep true red) (2004\u2013),\n*Peacock (bright blue) (2005\u20132015),\n*Heather (dark reddish-purple) (2006\u20132009), \n*Evergreen (dark green) (2007\u20132009),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/evergreenrelease.htm Evergreen Release 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Ivory (egg shell/off white) (2008\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/ivoryrelease.htm Ivory Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Chocolate (brown) (2008\u20132012),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/chocolaterelease.htm Chocolate Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Lemongrass (yellowish chartreuse) (2009\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/lemongrassrelease.htm Lemongrass Release 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Paprika (dark rust) (2010\u20132017),<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/notes/homer-laughlin-china/the-new-2010-fiestar-color-ispaprika/395032000165 Paprika Release 2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Marigold (yellowish-orange), HLC's 75th Anniversary Fiesta color - limited 75-week run (2011\u20132012)<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Marigold Release 2011<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Flamingo (light salmon pink) (2012\u20132013),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |title=Flamingo Release<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331053800/http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |archive-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Lapis (denim blue) (2013\u2013), announced March 2, 2013<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?id=68478260109&sk=app_344049209045098 Lapis Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Poppy (bright reddish-orange) (2014\u2013), announced March 15, 2014<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?hc_location=timeline]</ref>\n*Sage (earthy green) (2015\u20132019), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\">[http://alwaysfestive.com/2015/03/2015-new-colors/]</ref>\n*Slate (charcoal gray) (2015\u2013), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Claret (red wine) (2016\u20132018), announced March 5, 2016<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Daffodil (vibrant golden yellow) (2017\u2013), announced January 10, 2017<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Mulberry (deep purple) (2018\u2013), announced January 9, 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/homerlaughlinchina/photos/a.76045405109.110619.68478260109/10156462172275110/?type=3&theater|title=Fiesta Dinnerware|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n*Meadow (deep mint green) (2019\u2013), announced January 8, 2019<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Butterscotch (orange yellow) (2020\u2013), announced January 12, 2020<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n\n===Special edition colors===\nSince the reintroduction of Fiesta in 1986, Homer Laughlin has introduced three colors that were available for two years: Lilac (1993\u20131995), Chartreuse (1997\u20131999) and Juniper (1999\u20132001).  Sapphire was sold exclusively at [[Bloomingdale's]] from 1996 to 1997.  In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate.  The color of [[milk chocolate]], the new shade adds a second neutral tone to Fiesta's color palette.  It was available for a limited period of time and in a limited number of pieces.\n\nIn 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of [[dinnerware]] carrying the name Fiesta produced by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] since 1936.  In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold.  In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in [[Chicago]], Illinois.  This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen.  Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011\u20132012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Fiesta 75th Anniversary!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an indication of its influence, Fiestaware was featured in a design exhibit at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum in [[New York City]] in 1988.\n\n===Square Fiesta dinnerware===\nIn 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced.  Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories. \nDespite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company's established 'round' deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand's signature concentric rings.\n\nIn October 2016, Fiesta announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923).\n<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/squarerelease.htm Square Fiesta Dinnerware<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n''[[American Fiesta]]'', a one-man play written and performed by [[Steven Tomlinsoni]], refers to the central character's obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite news\n  | title = A Nation Bound by Colorful Dinnerware\n  | publisher = The New York Times, Ginia Bellafante, April 28, 2007\n  | url = http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/theater/reviews/28fies.html\n| date=April 28, 2007\n| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bauer Pottery]]\n*[[Franciscan Ceramics]]\n*[[Metlox]]\n*[[Pacific Clay]]\n*[[Sencer Sari]]\n*[[Uranium glass]]\n*[[Uranium tile]]\n*[[Vernon Kilns]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rowe, Willyum.

{"title_page": "As the Stomach Turns", "text_new": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter was when Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson, Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | N\u00ba\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest stars\n|-\n| 1\n| Season 1 (1967\u201368)\n| Ep 21\n| February 12, 1968\n| Marion's friend Victoria's long lost son is found after 15 years.\n| [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]]\n|-\n| 2\n| Season 2 (1968\u201369)\n| Ep 6\n| November 4, 1968\n| Marion and her widow friend Laura come back from a funeral.\n| [[Lucille Ball]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]\n|-\n| 3\n| rowspan=2 | Season 3 (1969\u201370)\n| Ep 5\n| October 20, 1969\n| Marion is planning on sending her grandfather away to Sun City.\n| [[Tim Conway]], [[Ken Berry]]\n|-\n| 4\n| Ep 6\n| November 3, 1969\n| Marion's brother Teddy comes for a visit and announces he's engaged to Miss Lily, the \"town naughty lady\".\n| [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Pat Boone]]\n|-\n| 5\n| rowspan=4 | Season 4 (1970\u201371)\n| Ep 3\n| September 28, 1970\n| Marion's friend Joyce announces she's a kleptomaniac.\n| [[Nanette Fabray]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]\n|-\n| 6\n| Ep 11\n| November 23, 1970\n| Marion's rich friend Louise and the Canoga Twins come over for a visit.\n| [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| 7\n| Ep 21\n| February 15, 1971\n| Marion's friend Estelle announces she's a werewolf.\n| [[Totie Fields]]\n|-\n| 8\n| Ep 26\n| March 29, 1971\n| Marion tells her friend Ren\u00e9e that she is broke and Felix Murdock the banker comes to foreclose on her house.\n| [[Nanette Fabray]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| 9\n| rowspan=3 | Season 5 (1971\u201372)\n| Ep 3\n| October 6, 1971\n| Marion's friend Jinx Vandenberg suffers from bad luck.\n| [[Carol Channing]], [[Steve Lawrence]]\n|-\n| 10\n| Ep 7\n| November 3, 1971\n| Marion's visitors are town masochist Mel Torment and Mother Marcus.\n| [[Bing Crosby]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| 11\n| Ep 8\n| November 10, 1971\n| Marion's modelling friend Suzie Shrimpton comes back to Canoga Falls.\n| [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Cass Elliot]]\n|-\n| 12\n| rowspan=2 | Season 6 (1972\u201373)\n| Ep 8\n| November 1, 1972\n| Marion goes to the circus.\n| [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]]\n|-\n| 13\n| Ep 20\n| February 17, 1973\n| Marion's friend David is deathly afraid of women.\n| [[Valerie Harper]], [[Tim Conway]]\n|-\n| 14\n| rowspan=2 | Season 7 (1973\u201374)\n| Ep 9\n| November 10, 1973\n| While desperately seeking a problem, Marion meets her long-lost twin sister.\n| [[Petula Clark]]\n|-\n| 15\n| Ep 20\n| February 16, 1974\n| Marion's niece Raven is possessed by the devil.\n| [[Bernadette Peters]]\n|-\n| 16\n| Season 8 (1974\u201375)\n| Ep 11\n| December 7, 1974\n| Don Provolone comes to blackmail Marion.\n| [[Steve Lawrence]]\n|-\n| 17\n| Season 9 (1975\u201376)\n| Ep 3\n| September 27, 1975\n| Pocahontas Perrelli visits and Canoga Falls has a new hairdresser, Warren Pretty \n| [[Cher]]\n|-\n| 18\n| Season 10 (1976\u201377)\n| Ep 20\n| February 26, 1977\n| Marion comes back from her daughter Jamie's funeral, only to realize that she's not dead but [[The Bionic Woman|bionic]].\n| N/A\n|-\n| 19\n| Season 11 (1977\u201378)\n| Ep 21\n| March 5, 1978\n| Marion's daughter comes back to Canoga Falls with an alien.\n| [[Steve Martin]], [[Betty White]]\n|-\n| 20\n| ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''\n| Ep 1.4\n| September 8, 1979\n| Marion is surprised by a visit from Pamela, a \"Miss America\" pageant winner on the lam.\n| [[Sally Field]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n[[Category:Comedy sketches]]\n[[Category:Television soap opera parodies]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter was when Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson, Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | N\u00ba\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest stars\n|-\n| 1\n| Season 1 (1967\u201368)\n| Ep 21\n| February 12, 1968\n| Marion's friend Victoria's long lost son is found after 15 years.\n| [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]]\n|-\n| 2\n| Season 2 (1968\u201369)\n| Ep 6\n| November 4, 1968\n| Marion and her widow friend Laura come back from a funeral.\n| [[Lucille Ball]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]\n|-\n| 3\n| rowspan=2 | Season 3 (1969\u201370)\n| Ep 5\n| October 20, 1969\n| Marion is planning on sending her grandfather away to Sun City.\n| [[Tim Conway]], [[Ken Berry]]\n|-\n| 4\n| Ep 6\n| November 3, 1969\n| Marion's brother Teddy comes for a visit and announces he's engaged to Miss Lily, the \"town naughty lady\".\n| [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Pat Boone]]\n|-\n| 5\n| rowspan=4 | Season 4 (1970\u201371)\n| Ep 3\n| September 28, 1970\n| Marion's friend Joyce announces she's a kleptomaniac.\n| [[Nanette Fabray]], Nancy Wilson\n|-\n| 6\n| Ep 11\n| November 23, 1970\n| Marion's rich friend Louise and the Canoga Twins come over for a visit.\n| [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| 7\n| Ep 21\n| February 15, 1971\n| Marion's friend Estelle announces she's a werewolf.\n| [[Totie Fields]]\n|-\n| 8\n| Ep 26\n| March 29, 1971\n| Marion tells her friend Ren\u00e9e that she is broke and Felix Murdock the banker comes to foreclose on her house.\n| Nanette Fabray, Paul Lynde\n|-\n| 9\n| rowspan=3 | Season 5 (1971\u201372)\n| Ep 3\n| October 6, 1971\n| Marion's friend Jinx Vandenberg suffers from bad luck.\n| [[Carol Channing]], [[Steve Lawrence]]\n|-\n| 10\n| Ep 7\n| November 3, 1971\n| Marion's visitors are town masochist Mel Torment and Mother Marcus.\n| [[Bing Crosby]], Paul Lynde\n|-\n| 11\n| Ep 8\n| November 10, 1971\n| Marion's modelling friend Suzie Shrimpton comes back to Canoga Falls.\n| [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Cass Elliot]]\n|-\n| 12\n| rowspan=2 | Season 6 (1972\u201373)\n| Ep 8\n| November 1, 1972\n| Marion goes to the circus.\n| [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]]\n|-\n| 13\n| Ep 20\n| February 17, 1973\n| Marion's friend David is deathly afraid of women.\n| [[Valerie Harper]], Tim Conway\n|-\n| 14\n| rowspan=2 | Season 7 (1973\u201374)\n| Ep 9\n| November 10, 1973\n| While desperately seeking a problem, Marion meets her long-lost twin sister.\n| [[Petula Clark]]\n|-\n| 15\n| Ep 20\n| February 16, 1974\n| Marion's niece Raven is possessed by the devil.\n| Bernadette Peters\n|-\n| 16\n| Season 8 (1974\u201375)\n| Ep 11\n| December 7, 1974\n| Don Provolone comes to blackmail Marion.\n| Steve Lawrence\n|-\n| 17\n| Season 9 (1975\u201376)\n| Ep 3\n| September 27, 1975\n| Pocahontas Perrelli visits and Canoga Falls has a new hairdresser, Warren Pretty \n| [[Cher]]\n|-\n| 18\n| Season 10 (1976\u201377)\n| Ep 20\n| February 26, 1977\n| Marion comes back from her daughter Jamie's funeral, only to realize that she's not dead but [[The Bionic Woman|bionic]].\n| N/A\n|-\n| 19\n| Season 11 (1977\u201378)\n| Ep 21\n| March 5, 1978\n| Marion's daughter comes back to Canoga Falls with an alien.\n| [[Steve Martin]], [[Betty White]]\n|-\n| 20\n| ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''\n| Ep 1.4\n| September 8, 1979\n| Marion is surprised by a visit from Pamela, a \"Miss America\" pageant winner on the lam.\n| [[Sally Field]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n[[Category:Comedy sketches]]\n[[Category:Television soap opera parodies]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSketches", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_Stomach_Turns"}

They had occupied this territory since the turn of the 18th century, after having settled in the region of the French trading post at [[Fort Detroit]]. The Odawa had controlled much of the territory along the Maumee River in present-day northwestern Ohio.<ref>''Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History,'' (University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, 1986) pp. 3, 58\u201359; and R.

In 1796, Spafford, a native of [[Connecticut]], was a surveyor for the [[Connecticut Land Company]]. He drew the first map laying out [[Cleveland]] and named the city. He left there in 1810 following appointment as custom's collector and [[postmaster]] for the new port at the foot of the rapids of the [[Maumee River]], Port Miami of [[Lake Erie]]. Spafford was granted a 160-acre land patent on River Tract #64 in Waynesfield township, signed by President [[James Monroe]]. Two years later, 67 families lived in the area, but most fled at the outbreak of the War of 1812.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.remarkableohio.org/HistoricalMarker.aspx?historicalMarkerId=679 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206103920/http://www.remarkableohio.org/HistoricalMarker.aspx?historicalMarkerId=679 |archive-date=2014-12-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the war and the 1817 [[Treaty of Fort Meigs]], which extinguished the Odawa claim to this area, Spafford purchased the land.\n===War of 1812===\nWhen the war clouds of 1812 began to edge toward Northwest Ohio, [[William Henry Harrison|General William Henry Harrison]] ordered the construction of the fort, beginning in February 1813.

Fort Meigs was constructed on a bluff above the [[Maumee River]], and built from a design by the army engineer Captain [[Eleazer D. Wood]], for whom the county would be named. Two critical battles with the British were fought at the fort during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nEarly settlers in the area fled to Huron during the War of 1812. They returned to settle in the floodplain below Fort Meigs, calling the settlement Orleans. They moved to higher ground after being flooded out. Perrysburg was located by a surveying team led by Alexander Bourne, appointed to that position by Edward Tiffin, Surveyor General of the United States. Contrary to numerous Internet postings, [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Charles Pierre L'Enfant]] did not survey and plat Perrysburg, Ohio on April 27, 1816; this survey was performed in late June and early July 1816, by surveyors Joseph Wampler and William Brookfield under the auspices of Alexander Bourne and [[Josiah Meigs]], Surveyor General of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.<ref>''History of the Maumee River Basin from the Earliest Account to Its Organization into Counties;'' Charles Elihu Slocum, 1905</ref>\n===Growth of Perrysburg===\nThe town soon became a center for shipbuilding and commerce on Lake Erie.

The town closed down for two months in that summer, trying to contain the epidemic at a time when people did not understand how it was transmitted. More than 100 people died. Other towns along the Maumee also suffered high losses from the epidemic, and [[Providence, Ohio]] was abandoned.

The Odawa had controlled much of the territory along the Maumee River in present-day northwestern Ohio.<ref>''Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History,'' (University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, 1986) pp. 3, 58\u201359; and R. Douglas Hurt, ''The Ohio Frontier: Crucible of the Old Northwest, 1720\u20131830'' (Indiana University Press: Bloomington, 1998), pp. 8\u201312</ref>\n\nIn 1810, early European-American settlers here were Major Amos Spafford (1753-1818), his wife Olive (1756-1823), and their four children. In 1796, Spafford, a native of [[Connecticut]], was a surveyor for the [[Connecticut Land Company]]. He drew the first map laying out [[Cleveland]] and named the city. He left there in 1810 following appointment as custom's collector and [[postmaster]] for the new port at the foot of the rapids of the [[Maumee River]], Port Miami of [[Lake Erie]]. Spafford was granted a 160-acre land patent on River Tract #64 in Waynesfield township, signed by President [[James Monroe]]. Two years later, 67 families lived in the area, but most fled at the outbreak of the War of 1812.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.remarkableohio.org/HistoricalMarker.aspx?historicalMarkerId=679 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206103920/http://www.remarkableohio.org/HistoricalMarker.aspx?historicalMarkerId=679 |archive-date=2014-12-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the war and the 1817 [[Treaty of Fort Meigs]], which extinguished the Odawa claim to this area, Spafford purchased the land.\n===War of 1812===\nWhen the war clouds of 1812 began to edge toward Northwest Ohio, [[William Henry Harrison|General William Henry Harrison]] ordered the construction of the fort, beginning in February 1813. Harrison was General [[Anthony Wayne]]'s former aide-de-camp. Later he was elected as the country's ninth president. The installation was named [[Fort Meigs]] in honor of Ohio's fourth governor, [[Return J. Meigs, Jr.|Return Jonathan Meigs]]. Fort Meigs was constructed on a bluff above the [[Maumee River]], and built from a design by the army engineer Captain [[Eleazer D. Wood]], for whom the county would be named. Two critical battles with the British were fought at the fort during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nEarly settlers in the area fled to Huron during the War of 1812. They returned to settle in the floodplain below Fort Meigs, calling the settlement Orleans. They moved to higher ground after being flooded out. Perrysburg was located by a surveying team led by Alexander Bourne, appointed to that position by Edward Tiffin, Surveyor General of the United States. Contrary to numerous Internet postings, [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Charles Pierre L'Enfant]] did not survey and plat Perrysburg, Ohio on April 27, 1816; this survey was performed in late June and early July 1816, by surveyors Joseph Wampler and William Brookfield under the auspices of Alexander Bourne and [[Josiah Meigs]], Surveyor General of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.<ref>''History of the Maumee River Basin from the Earliest Account to Its Organization into Counties;'' Charles Elihu Slocum, 1905</ref>\n===Growth of Perrysburg===\nThe town soon became a center for shipbuilding and commerce on Lake Erie.

The town closed down for two months in that summer, trying to contain the epidemic at a time when people did not understand how it was transmitted. More than 100 people died. Other towns along the Maumee also suffered high losses from the epidemic, and [[Providence, Ohio]] was abandoned.
