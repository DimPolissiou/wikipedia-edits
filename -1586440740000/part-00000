They are generally referred to as '''phasmatodeans''', '''phasmids''', or  '''ghost insects'''. Phasmids in the family [[Phylliidae]] are called '''leaf insects''', '''leaf-bugs''', '''walking leaves''', or '''bug leaves'''. The group's name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}} ''{{transl|grc|phasma}}'', meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to their resemblance to vegetation while in fact being animals. Their natural [[camouflage]] makes them difficult for [[Predation|predators]] to detect; still, many species have one of several secondary [[antipredator adaptation|lines of defence]] in the form of [[deimatic behaviour|startle display]]s, spines or toxic secretions. The genus ''[[Phobaeticus]]'' includes the world's longest insects.\n\nMembers of the order are found on all continents except [[Antarctica]], but they are most abundant in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]]. They are herbivorous, with many species living unobtrusively in the tree canopy. They have a [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] life cycle with three stages: egg, [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] and adult. Many phasmids are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]], and do not require fertilized eggs for female offspring to be produced. In hotter climates, they may breed all year round; in more temperate regions, the females lay eggs in the autumn before dying, and the new generation hatches in the spring. Some species have wings and can disperse by flying, while others are more restricted.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Phobaeticus chani Bragg, 2008; Holotype Female dorsal view.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5<!--width for very low image-->|Female ''[[Phobaeticus chani]]'', the world's longest insect.

Where present, the first pair of wings is narrow and [[Keratin|cornified]] (hardened), while the hind wings are broad, with straight veins along their length and multiple cross-veins. The body is often further modified to resemble vegetation, with ridges resembling leaf veins, bark-like [[tubercles]], and other forms of [[camouflage]]. A few species, such as ''[[Carausius morosus]]'', are even able to change their [[Biological pigments|pigmentation]] to match their surroundings. The [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] project out from the head. Chewing [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] are uniform across species. The legs are typically long and slender, and some species are capable of limb [[autotomy]] (appendage shedding).<ref name=IIBD/> Phasmids have long, slender [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], as long as or longer than the rest of the body in some species.\n\n[[File:Australian Leaf Insect, portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Head of a female ''[[Extatosoma tiaratum]]'']]\nAll phasmids possess [[compound eye]]s, but [[ocelli]] (light-sensitive organs) are only found in some winged males.<ref name=IIBD/> Phasmids have an impressive visual system that allows them to perceive significant detail even in dim conditions, which suits their typically [[nocturnal]] lifestyle. They are born equipped with tiny compound eyes with a limited number of facets. As phasmids grow through successive [[moulting|molts]], the number of facets in each eye is increased along with the number of [[photoreceptor cell]]s. The sensitivity of the adult eye is at least tenfold that of the nymph in its first [[instar]] (developmental stage). As the eye grows more complex, the mechanisms to adapt to dark/light changes are also enhanced: eyes in dark conditions evidence fewer screening pigments, which would block light, than during the daytime, and changes in the width of the retinal layer to adapt to changes in available light are significantly more pronounced in adults. The larger size of the adult insects' eyes makes them more prone to radiation damage. This explains why fully grown individuals are mostly nocturnal. Lessened sensitivity to light in the newly emerged insects helps them to escape from the [[leaf litter]] wherein they are hatched and move upward into the more brightly illuminated foliage. Young stick insects are [[Diurnality|diurnal]] (daytime) feeders and move around freely, expanding their [[foraging]] range.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow |first=V.

However, these movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from\nthe background by relative motion. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion to help them discern objects in the foreground.<ref>O'Dea, JD.

A record among insects, the stick insect ''[[Necroscia sparaxes]]'', found in India, is sometimes coupled for 79 days at a time. It is not uncommon for this species to assume the [[mating posture]] for days or weeks on end, and among some species (''[[Diapheromera veliei]]'' and ''[[D. covilleae]]''), pairing can last three to 136 hours in captivity.<ref name=\"siv1980\">{{cite journal| last=Sivinski| first=John| title=Effects of Mating on Predation in the Stick Insect ''Diapheromera veliei'' Walsh (Phasmatodea: Heteronemiidae)| journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America| year=1980| volume=73 |issue=5 |doi=10.1093/aesa/73.5.553  |pages=553\u2013556}}</ref>\n\nOvert displays of aggression between males over mates suggests that extended pairing may have [[evolved]] to guard females from [[sperm competition]].

Occasionally, the consort will strike out at the competitor with the mid femora, which are equipped with an enlarged and hooked spine in both sexes that can draw the blood of the opponent when they are flexed against the body to puncture the [[integument]].<ref name=\"siv1978\" /> Usually, a strong hold on the female's abdomen and blows to the intruder are enough to deter the unwanted competition, but occasionally the competitor has been observed to employ a sneaky tactic to [[inseminate]] the female. While the first mate is engaged in feeding and is forced to vacate the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] position, the intruder can clasp the female's abdomen and insert his [[genitalia]]. If he is discovered, the males will enter into combat wherein they lean backward, both clasped to the female's abdomen, and freely suspended, engage in rapid, sweeping blows with their forelegs in a manner similar to [[boxing]]. Usually, when the intruder gains attachment to the female's abdomen, these conflicts result in the displacement of the original mate.<ref name=\"siv1978\" />\n\n[[File:Carausius morosus.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Carausius morosus]]'' is often kept as a pet by schools and individuals.]]\n\nLengthy pairings have also been described in terms of a defensive alliance. When cleaved together, the pair is more unwieldy for predators to handle. Also, the chemical defenses (secretions, reflex bleeding, regurgitation) of the individual stick insect are enhanced when two are paired. Females survive attacks by predators significantly better when pairing, largely because the dorsal position of the male functions well as a shield. This could indicate that manipulation by females is taking place: if females accept [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] at a slow rate, for instance, the males are forced to remain [[sexual intercourse|''in copulo'']] for longer and the female's chances of survival are enhanced. Also, evolution could have simply favored males that remained attached to their females longer, since females are often less abundant than males and represent a valuable prize, so for the lucky male, even the sacrifice of his own life to preserve his [[offspring]] with the female may be worthwhile. [[Sexual dimorphism]] in the species, where females are usually significantly larger than the males, may have evolved due to the fitness advantage accrued to males that can remain attached to the female, thereby blocking competitors, without severely impeding her movement.<ref name=\"siv1980\" />\n\nCertain Phasmatodea, such as ''Anisomorpha buprestoides'', sometimes form aggregations. These insects have been observed to congregate during the day in a concealed location, going their separate ways at nightfall to forage, and returning to their refuge before dawn.

They are generally referred to as '''phasmatodeans''', '''phasmids''', or  '''ghost insects'''. Phasmids in the family [[Phylliidae]] are called '''leaf insects''', '''leaf-bugs''', '''walking leaves''', or '''bug leaves'''. The group's name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}} ''{{transl|grc|phasma}}'', meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to their resemblance to vegetation while in fact being animals. Their natural [[camouflage]] makes them difficult for [[Predation|predators]] to detect; still, many species have one of several secondary [[antipredator adaptation|lines of defence]] in the form of [[deimatic behaviour|startle display]]s, spines or toxic secretions. The genus ''[[Phobaeticus]]'' includes the world's longest insects.\n\nMembers of the order are found on all continents except [[Antarctica]], but they are most abundant in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]]. They are herbivorous, with many species living unobtrusively in the tree canopy. They have a [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] life cycle with three stages: egg, [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] and adult. Many phasmids are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]], and do not require fertilized eggs for female offspring to be produced. In hotter climates, they may breed all year round; in more temperate regions, the females lay eggs in the autumn before dying, and the new generation hatches in the spring. Some species have wings and can disperse by flying, while others are more restricted.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Phobaeticus chani Bragg, 2008; Holotype Female dorsal view.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5<!--width for very low image-->|Female ''[[Phobaeticus chani]]'', the world's longest insect.

Where present, the first pair of wings is narrow and [[Keratin|cornified]] (hardened), while the hind wings are broad, with straight veins along their length and multiple cross-veins. The body is often further modified to resemble vegetation, with ridges resembling leaf veins, bark-like [[tubercles]], and other forms of [[camouflage]]. A few species, such as ''[[Carausius morosus]]'', are even able to change their [[Biological pigments|pigmentation]] to match their surroundings. The [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] project out from the head. Chewing [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] are uniform across species. The legs are typically long and slender, and some species are capable of limb [[autotomy]] (appendage shedding).<ref name=IIBD/> Phasmids have long, slender [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], as long as or longer than the rest of the body in some species.\n\n[[File:Australian Leaf Insect, portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Head of a female ''[[Extatosoma tiaratum]]'']]\nAll phasmids possess [[compound eye]]s, but [[ocelli]] (light-sensitive organs) are only found in some winged males.<ref name=IIBD/> Phasmids have an impressive visual system that allows them to perceive significant detail even in dim conditions, which suits their typically [[nocturnal]] lifestyle. They are born equipped with tiny compound eyes with a limited number of facets. As phasmids grow through successive [[moulting|molts]], the number of facets in each eye is increased along with the number of [[photoreceptor cell]]s. The sensitivity of the adult eye is at least tenfold that of the nymph in its first [[instar]] (developmental stage). As the eye grows more complex, the mechanisms to adapt to dark/light changes are also enhanced: eyes in dark conditions evidence fewer screening pigments, which would block light, than during the daytime, and changes in the width of the retinal layer to adapt to changes in available light are significantly more pronounced in adults. The larger size of the adult insects' eyes makes them more prone to radiation damage. This explains why fully grown individuals are mostly nocturnal. Lessened sensitivity to light in the newly emerged insects helps them to escape from the [[leaf litter]] wherein they are hatched and move upward into the more brightly illuminated foliage. Young stick insects are [[Diurnality|diurnal]] (daytime) feeders and move around freely, expanding their [[foraging]] range.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow |first=V.

Their life cycle is annual, living only during the hottest months (especially genera ''Leptynia'' and ''Pijnackeria''), which usually means late spring to early autumn.\n\n<center><gallery>\nFile:LeafInsect.jpg|''Phyllium'' sp., from the [[Western Ghats]].\nFile:Clonopsis gallica01.jpg|''[[Clonopsis gallica]]''.\nFile:Ctenomorpha chronus02.jpg|''Ctenomorpha chronus''.\nFile:Leptynia hispanica.png|Leptynia hispanica\n</gallery></center>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Poke It Stick.ogv|thumb|Video of a walking phasmid]]\nStick insects, like [[praying mantis]]es, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive, side-to-side movements. The common interpretation of this behavior's function is it enhances [[crypsis]] by mimicking vegetation moving in the wind. However, these movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from\nthe background by relative motion. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion to help them discern objects in the foreground.<ref>O'Dea, JD.

A record among insects, the stick insect ''[[Necroscia sparaxes]]'', found in India, is sometimes coupled for 79 days at a time. It is not uncommon for this species to assume the [[mating posture]] for days or weeks on end, and among some species (''[[Diapheromera veliei]]'' and ''[[D. covilleae]]''), pairing can last three to 136 hours in captivity.<ref name=\"siv1980\">{{cite journal| last=Sivinski| first=John| title=Effects of Mating on Predation in the Stick Insect ''Diapheromera veliei'' Walsh (Phasmatodea: Heteronemiidae)| journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America| year=1980| volume=73 |issue=5 |doi=10.1093/aesa/73.5.553  |pages=553\u2013556}}</ref>\n\nOvert displays of aggression between males over mates suggests that extended pairing may have [[evolved]] to guard females from [[sperm competition]]. Fighting between competing males has been observed in the species ''D. veiliei'' and ''D. covilleae''.<ref name=\"siv1978\">{{cite journal|last=Sivinski|first=John|title=Intersexual Aggression in the Stick Insects ''Diapheromera veliei'' and ''D. covilleae'' and Sexual Dimorphism in the Phasmatodea| journal=Psyche| year=1978| volume=85| issue=4 |doi=10.1155/1978/35784 |pages=395\u2013403}}</ref> During these encounters, the approach of a challenger causes the existing mate to manipulate the female's abdomen, which he has clasped by means of the clasping organ, or vomer, down upon itself to block the site of attachment. Occasionally, the consort will strike out at the competitor with the mid femora, which are equipped with an enlarged and hooked spine in both sexes that can draw the blood of the opponent when they are flexed against the body to puncture the [[integument]].<ref name=\"siv1978\" /> Usually, a strong hold on the female's abdomen and blows to the intruder are enough to deter the unwanted competition, but occasionally the competitor has been observed to employ a sneaky tactic to [[inseminate]] the female. While the first mate is engaged in feeding and is forced to vacate the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] position, the intruder can clasp the female's abdomen and insert his [[genitalia]]. If he is discovered, the males will enter into combat wherein they lean backward, both clasped to the female's abdomen, and freely suspended, engage in rapid, sweeping blows with their forelegs in a manner similar to [[boxing]]. Usually, when the intruder gains attachment to the female's abdomen, these conflicts result in the displacement of the original mate.<ref name=\"siv1978\" />\n\n[[File:Carausius morosus.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Carausius morosus]]'' is often kept as a pet by schools and individuals.]]\n\nLengthy pairings have also been described in terms of a defensive alliance. When cleaved together, the pair is more unwieldy for predators to handle. Also, the chemical defenses (secretions, reflex bleeding, regurgitation) of the individual stick insect are enhanced when two are paired. Females survive attacks by predators significantly better when pairing, largely because the dorsal position of the male functions well as a shield. This could indicate that manipulation by females is taking place: if females accept [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] at a slow rate, for instance, the males are forced to remain [[sexual intercourse|''in copulo'']] for longer and the female's chances of survival are enhanced. Also, evolution could have simply favored males that remained attached to their females longer, since females are often less abundant than males and represent a valuable prize, so for the lucky male, even the sacrifice of his own life to preserve his [[offspring]] with the female may be worthwhile. [[Sexual dimorphism]] in the species, where females are usually significantly larger than the males, may have evolved due to the fitness advantage accrued to males that can remain attached to the female, thereby blocking competitors, without severely impeding her movement.<ref name=\"siv1980\" />\n\nCertain Phasmatodea, such as ''Anisomorpha buprestoides'', sometimes form aggregations. These insects have been observed to congregate during the day in a concealed location, going their separate ways at nightfall to forage, and returning to their refuge before dawn. Such behavior has been little studied, and how the insects find their way back is unknown.<ref name=Costa/>\n\n==In human culture==\n\n[[File:Leaf Insects and Stick Insects Marianne North.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Leaf Insects and Stick Insects by [[Marianne North]], 1870s]]\n\nStick insects are often kept in captivity: almost 300 species have been reared in laboratories or as pets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bragg | first1 = P | year = 2008 | title = Changes to the PSG Culture List | url = | journal = Phasmid Study Group Newsletter | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 4\u20135 }}</ref> The most commonly kept is the Indian (or laboratory) stick insect, ''[[Carausius morosus]]'', which eats vegetables such as lettuce.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boucher |first=Stephanie |author2=Hirondelle Varady-Szabo |title=Effects of different diets on the survival, longevity and growth rate of the Annam stick insect, Medauroidea extradentata (Phasmatodea: Phasmatidae) |journal=Journal of Orthoptera Research |year=2005 |volume=14 |pages=115\u2013118 |doi=10.1665/1082-6467(2005)14[115:eoddot]2.0.co;2|type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> Droppings of the stick insect ''Eurycnema versirubra'' (Serville, 1838) [=''Eurycnema versifasciata''] fed with specific plants are made into a medicinal [[insect tea|tea]] by Malaysian Chinese to treat ailments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nadchatram, M.|year=1963|title= The winged stick insect, Eurycnema versifasciata Serville (Phasmida, Phasmatidae), with special reference to its life history|journal= Malayan Nature Journal|volume=17|pages=33\u201340}}</ref>\n\nThe [[botanical illustrator]] [[Marianne North]] (1830\u20131890) painted leaf and stick insects that she saw on her travels in the 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=North |first1=Marianne|title=Leaf-Insects and Stick-Insects |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/leaf-insects-and-stick-insects-88081 |website=[[Art UK]] |accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nTribesmen in [[Sarawak]] eat phasmids and their eggs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker, Edward |title=The worldwide status of phasmids (Insecta: Phasmida) as pests of agriculture and forestry, with a generalised theory of phasmid outbreaks | journal=Agriculture and Food Security |date=2015 |doi=10.1186/s40066-015-0040-6 |volume=4|url=https://nhm.openrepository.com/bitstream/10141/615363/3/Baker%202015.pdf }}</ref>\n\nSome indigenous people of the [[D'Entrecasteaux Islands]] have traditionally made fishhooks from the legs of certain phasmids.<ref>{{cite book |last=Osmond |first1=Meredith |editor-last1=Ross |editor-first1=Malcolm |editor-last2=Pawley |editor-first2=Andrew |editor-last3=Osmond |editor-first3=Meredith|title=The lexicon of Proto Oceanic vol. 1 Material culture |date=1998 |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |location=Canberra |isbn=0-85883-507-X |page=219 |chapter=Chapter 8: Fishing and Hunting Implements |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/106908 |accessdate=9 February 2020 |doi=10.15144/PL-C152.211}}</ref>\n \nResearch has been conducted to analyze the stick insect method of walking and apply this to the engineering of six-legged [[walking robot]]s.
