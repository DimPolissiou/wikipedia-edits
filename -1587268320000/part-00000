Written by [[Josh Kear]], [[Gordie Sampson]] and [[Hillary Lindsey]], the song is about a man dealing with the fallout of a relationship like an addiction.

This was due to the label wanting to withdraw the single from radio and release \u201cBetter in Boots\u201d instead, feeling that a more upbeat single would climb the charts quicker and bolster his concert audience.

({{IPAc-en|t\u0283|k|.|t\u0283|k|.|t\u0283|k}} {{Respell|chk-chk-chk}}) is an American [[dance-punk]] band from [[Sacramento, California]],<ref name=Cos>{{harvnb|Coscarelli|2007}}</ref> formed in 1995 by lead singer [[Nic Offer]]. Members of !!! came from other local bands such as the Yah Mos, Black Liquorice and Pope Smashers. They are currently based in [[New York City]]. The band's eighth album, ''[[Wallop (album)|Wallop]]'', was released in August 2019.<ref name=Cos/>\n\n==Background and history==\n!!! is an American band formed in the fall of 1996 by the merger of members of the groups Black Liquorice and Popesmashers. After a successful joint tour, the two bands decided to mix the disco-funk with more aggressive sounds and integrate the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] singer Nic Offer from the Yah Mos. The band's name was inspired by the subtitles of the movie ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'', in which the [[click consonant|clicking sounds]] of the [[San people|Bushmen's]] [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language]] were represented as \"!\". However, as the bandmembers themselves say, !!! is pronounced by repeating thrice any monosyllabic sound. \"Chk Chk Chk\" is the most common pronunciation,<ref name=sea/> and the URL of their official website and the title of their [[Myspace]] page suggest it is the preferred pronunciation.\n\nThe band's full-length debut record came out in 2000 as a self-titled album on the label [[Gold Standard Laboratories]]. This was followed in 2003 by the single \"Me and Giuliani Down By the School Yard\", a lengthy track combining [[house music|house]] beats with sinewy [[bassline]]s, [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] guitars, and simple lyrics which quote the title song of the musical ''[[Footloose (musical)|Footloose]]''.\n\nA second full-length, ''[[Louden Up Now]]'', was released on [[Touch and Go Records|Touch and Go]] in America and on [[Warp (record label)|Warp Records]] in Europe in June 2004. In June 2005 !!! released a new [[Extended play|EP]] covering \"[[Holiday (The Magnetic Fields album)|Take Ecstasy with Me]]\" by [[The Magnetic Fields]], and \"Get Up\" by [[Nate Dogg]]. The following December, the original drummer for the band, Mikel Gius, was struck and killed by a car while riding his bike.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2005}}</ref>\n\nThey released their third album, ''[[Myth Takes]]'' in 2007.<ref name=sea>{{harvnb|Seabrook|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Diver|2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Coachella2004 ChkChkChk.jpg|400px|thumb|!!! performing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on May 2, 2004.]]\n!!! is composed of Mario Andreoni (guitar), Dan Gorman ([[horn section|horns]]/percussion/[[musical keyboard|keys]]), Nic Offer (vocals), Rafael Cohen (bass/various electronic devices), Chris Egan (drums) and Meah Pace (vocals).\n\nVocalist and drummer John Pugh officially left the band in July 2007 to concentrate on his new band Free Blood.<ref>{{harvnb|Maher|Solarski|2007}}</ref>\nVocalist Shannon Funchess stood in for Pugh during much of their 2007 tour.<ref>{{harvnb|Lopez|2010}}</ref> The band also shared membership with the similar, defunct group [[Out Hud]] (including Tyler Pope, who has played with [[LCD Soundsystem]] and written music for [[Cake (band)|Cake]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Chinen|2007}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Dance/Electronic Albums|US Elec.]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|FRA]]<br /><ref name=\"fr\">{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"|[[Oricon|JPN]]<br><ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2017}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br /><ref name=\"zobbel\">{{harvnb|Anon|2017a}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | ''[[!!!

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on September 17, 1997. In the episode, [[List of South Park families#Grampa Marsh|Grandpa Marvin]] tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, while the parents of South Park protest the foul-mouthed cartoon ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]''. [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives to kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and presents a warning to Grandpa Marvin against forcing others to help him commit suicide.\n\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. The episode, along with the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show, were inspired by early criticism that ''South Park'' was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against [[censorship]] and addresses the morality and ethics of [[euthanasia]].\n\n\"Death\" was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season. The episode's plot heavily influenced the screenplay of the 1999 film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', which also involves South Park parents protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. In addition to Terrance and Phillip, the episode introduced recurring characters Grandpa Marsh and [[List of South Park families#Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] (then known as Carol), [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s mother, while Kenny's father [[Stuart McCormick]] appears as an unnamed character with a cameo in his debut appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[List of South Park families#The Marshes|Marsh family]] celebrates [[Grampa Marsh]]'s 102nd birthday, but he is tired of living and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, but Stan refuses because he fears he might get in trouble. Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] watches the cartoon ''[[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]]'', which revolves largely around [[Flatulence humor|fart jokes]]. [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Kyle's mother]] gets outraged by the foul language and crude humor, and contacts other South Park parents to organize a boycott at the Cartoon Central headquarters in [[New York City]]. Later at school, Stan asks [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] and [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Jesus|Jesus]] whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] suffers from a bout of \"explosive diarrhea\", which spreads to others in the town, including the adults protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch ''Terrance and Phillip'' at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of [[Enya]]'s \"[[Orinoco Flow]]\". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.\n\nWhile fleeing, Stan calls his [[List of South Park families#Randy and Sharon Marsh|mother]], who is too busy protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' to listen to his problems. More than a dozen people have killed themselves against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing ''Terrance and Phillip''. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill ''him'', but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in [[limbo]].\n\n''Terrence and Phillip'' is replaced by the [[Suzanne Somers]] show ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'' which also contains obscenities. Furious about all this, the parents go back to the Cartoon Central network building to protest again. Grandpa Marvin decides to visit Africa, where over 400 people are \"naturally\" eaten by [[lion]]s every year. The episode ends with the boys laughing, and then laughing harder when Kyle farts.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Two seated men. One holds a microphone in one hand and gestures with the other.|250px|right|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote \"Death\"]]\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season of 13 episodes. Parker long wanted to feature a [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-like death character in ''South Park'' because since his childhood, Parker enjoyed drawing cartoon images of Death riding on a tricycle. This was the inspiration behind a scene in which Death inexplicably rides a tricycle while chasing the South Park boys through the streets.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\">{{cite video|people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=audio commentary|medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\nThe subplot of Kenny's diarrhea problems came from a real-life high school experience from Stone, who said students used to offer each other $20 if they would pass a note to the teacher explaining they had \"explosive diarrhea\", like Kenny did in the episode.<ref name=\"StoneComm\">{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in \"Death\" became a popular ''South Park'' poster.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\"/> \"Death\" included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future ''South Park'' episodes.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\">{{cite book |title=The South Park Episode Guide: Volume 1, Seasons 1\u20135 |last=Stall |first=Sam |year=2009 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |location=New York City |isbn= 978-0-7624-3561-6 |page=21}}</ref> During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in \"Death\" after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Stuart McCormick]], but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> The character appears again very briefly in a later episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\n==Themes==\nDuring the first few weeks of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s run, Parker and Stone received criticism from some commentators and media outlets that the series was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation, and thus must be a simple show to produce. \"Death\" was written in response to that criticism. The episode introduced [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], a comedy duo with a popular cartoon series within the ''South Park'' universe, whose show is literally nothing but a series of flatulence jokes, with even cruder animation than ''South Park'' itself.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode's script parodied parents who voiced strong opposition to ''South Park'', portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that they fail to pay attention to what is going on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage57\">{{cite book|last=Gossage|first=Anne|title=The Deep End of South Park|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57 57]|isbn=978-0-7864-4307-9|publisher=McFarland & Company|url=https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage218\">{{cite book|last=Savage Jr.|first=William J.|title=Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/leavingspringfie00albe/page/218 218]|isbn=0-8143-2849-0|publisher=Wayne State University Press|title-link=Leaving Springfield}}</ref> This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, \"I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids.\"<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n\"Death\" warns against such misplaced values and condemns the practice of [[censorship]], as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like ''South Park'' or ''Terrance and Phillip''.<ref name=\"Gossage57\" /> The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere.<ref name=\"Savage218\" /> The plot of \"Death\" heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, \"After about the first year of ''South Park'', [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] already wanted to make a ''South Park'' movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n\"Death\" also touches upon the issue of [[euthanasia]], and whether it is morally or ethically wrong to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage58\">Gossage, p. 58</ref> The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience it would be for Stan. This is most strongly illustrated at the end of the episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of \"natural causes\", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, \"Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n==Cultural references and impact==\n\"Death\" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Grandpa Marvin Marsh]]. Sheila and Gerald Broflovski, Kyle's parents, were named after Stone's parents, although he insists the characters are nothing like his real parents. Marvin Marsh was not based on any real-life person, but Parker and Stone wanted to create a rude and unlikeable grandfather character because they felt most elderly people were portrayed as sweet and lovable on television.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> Originally, they wanted Marvin Marsh to be known as the \"molesting grandpa\" who kept making sexual comments to Stan and attempting to play inappropriate games with him, but Comedy Central refused to allow it, which Parker said was \"probably the right call\".<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> Terrance and Phillip are loosely based on Parker and Stone themselves, and were also inspired by the [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as well as the protagonists from the [[MTV]] cartoon ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. Although \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Terrance and Phillip, Parker said the duo \"took on a life of their own\". They made frequent appearances throughout the rest of the series, and played a major role in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut''.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode refers to [[Jack Kevorkian]], the right-to-die activist best known for his advocacy of [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as \"Jack Leborkian\". When ''Terrance and Phillip'' is cancelled in \"Death\", it is replaced by ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'', a sitcom starring actress [[Suzanne Somers]].<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" /> The Cartoon Central network in \"Death\" is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts ''South Park''. John Warsog, the man who runs Cartoon Central in \"Death\", is based on [[Doug Herzog]], the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing ''South Park'' to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him in a room and plays music by the Irish vocalist [[Enya]] as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him. The parody of Enya's [[Orinoco Flow]] used in \"Death\" was sung by [[Toddy Walters]], who played protagonist [[Polly Pry]] in Trey Parker's 1996 film, ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]''.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /><ref name=\"toddywalters\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/2002-11-28/music/hollywood-squares/2/ |page=2 |title=Hollywood Squares |work=[[Westword]] |first=Patrick |last=Casey |date=November 28, 2002 |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Snacky Cakes, one of Cartman's favorite snack foods.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n==Reception==\nIn the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'', author William J.

Furious about all this, the parents go back to the Cartoon Central network building to protest again. Grandpa Marvin decides to visit Africa, where over 400 people are \"naturally\" eaten by [[lion]]s every year. The episode ends with the boys laughing, and then laughing harder when Kyle farts.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Two seated men. One holds a microphone in one hand and gestures with the other.|250px|right|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote \"Death\"]]\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season of 13 episodes. Parker long wanted to feature a [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-like death character in ''South Park'' because since his childhood, Parker enjoyed drawing cartoon images of Death riding on a tricycle. This was the inspiration behind a scene in which Death inexplicably rides a tricycle while chasing the South Park boys through the streets.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\">{{cite video|people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=audio commentary|medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\nThe subplot of Kenny's diarrhea problems came from a real-life high school experience from Stone, who said students used to offer each other $20 if they would pass a note to the teacher explaining they had \"explosive diarrhea\", like Kenny did in the episode.<ref name=\"StoneComm\">{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in \"Death\" became a popular ''South Park'' poster.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\"/> \"Death\" included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future ''South Park'' episodes.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\">{{cite book |title=The South Park Episode Guide: Volume 1, Seasons 1\u20135 |last=Stall |first=Sam |year=2009 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |location=New York City |isbn= 978-0-7624-3561-6 |page=21}}</ref> During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in \"Death\" after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Stuart McCormick]], but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> The character appears again very briefly in a later episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\n==Themes==\nDuring the first few weeks of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s run, Parker and Stone received criticism from some commentators and media outlets that the series was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation, and thus must be a simple show to produce. \"Death\" was written in response to that criticism. The episode introduced [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], a comedy duo with a popular cartoon series within the ''South Park'' universe, whose show is literally nothing but a series of flatulence jokes, with even cruder animation than ''South Park'' itself.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode's script parodied parents who voiced strong opposition to ''South Park'', portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that they fail to pay attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage57\">{{cite book|last=Gossage|first=Anne|title=The Deep End of South Park|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57 57]|isbn=978-0-7864-4307-9|publisher=McFarland & Company|url=https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage218\">{{cite book|last=Savage Jr.|first=William J.|title=Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/leavingspringfie00albe/page/218 218]|isbn=0-8143-2849-0|publisher=Wayne State University Press|title-link=Leaving Springfield}}</ref> This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, \"I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids.\"<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n\"Death\" warns against such misplaced values and condemns the practice of [[censorship]], as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like ''South Park'' or ''Terrance and Phillip''.<ref name=\"Gossage57\" /> The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere.<ref name=\"Savage218\" /> The plot of \"Death\" heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, \"After about the first year of ''South Park'', [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] already wanted to make a ''South Park'' movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n\"Death\" also touches upon the issue of [[euthanasia]], and whether it is morally or ethically wrong to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage58\">Gossage, p. 58</ref> The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience it would be for Stan. This is most strongly illustrated at the end of the episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of \"natural causes\", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, \"Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n==Cultural references and impact==\n\"Death\" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Grandpa Marvin Marsh]]. Sheila and Gerald Broflovski, Kyle's parents, were named after Stone's parents, although he insists the characters are nothing like his real parents. Marvin Marsh was not based on any real-life person, but Parker and Stone wanted to create a rude and unlikeable grandfather character because they felt most elderly people were portrayed as sweet and lovable on television.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> Originally, they wanted Marvin Marsh to be known as the \"molesting grandpa\" who kept making sexual comments to Stan and attempting to play inappropriate games with him, but Comedy Central refused to allow it, which Parker said was \"probably the right call\".<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> Terrance and Phillip are loosely based on Parker and Stone themselves, and were also inspired by the [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as well as the protagonists from the [[MTV]] cartoon ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. Although \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Terrance and Phillip, Parker said the duo \"took on a life of their own\". They made frequent appearances throughout the rest of the series, and played a major role in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut''.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode refers to [[Jack Kevorkian]], the right-to-die activist best known for his advocacy of [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as \"Jack Leborkian\". When ''Terrance and Phillip'' is cancelled in \"Death\", it is replaced by ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'', a sitcom starring actress [[Suzanne Somers]].<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" /> The Cartoon Central network in \"Death\" is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts ''South Park''. John Warsog, the man who runs Cartoon Central in \"Death\", is based on [[Doug Herzog]], the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing ''South Park'' to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him in a room and plays music by the Irish vocalist [[Enya]] as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him. The parody of Enya's [[Orinoco Flow]] used in \"Death\" was sung by [[Toddy Walters]], who played protagonist [[Polly Pry]] in Trey Parker's 1996 film, ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]''.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /><ref name=\"toddywalters\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/2002-11-28/music/hollywood-squares/2/ |page=2 |title=Hollywood Squares |work=[[Westword]] |first=Patrick |last=Casey |date=November 28, 2002 |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Snacky Cakes, one of Cartman's favorite snack foods.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n==Reception==\nIn the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'', author William J. Savage, Jr. said the episode \"reveals a fine edged attack on censors and a thoughtful and subtle consideration of issues regarding assisted suicide.\"<ref>Savage, p. 217</ref> In the book ''The Deep End of South Park'', Anne Gossage complimented the ambition of episode's themes of censorship and the morality of assisted suicide, which she called \"a great deal of ground to cover in 20 minutes\".<ref name=\"Gossage56\">Gossage, p. 56</ref> Gossage also said the episode shared many of the same characteristics of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', comparing Stan's contemplation of killing his grandfather to Hamlet's dilemmas after encountering his father's ghost.<ref name=\"Gossage58\" />\n\n==Home video release==\n\"Death\" was released alongside five other episodes in a three-VHS set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time ''South Park'' was made available on video.
