The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies they are used to pass down cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants' undivided attention, modulation of infants' arousal, and regulation of behavior.<ref>Doja, Albert. \"Socializing Enchantment: A Socio-Anthropological Approach to Infant-Directed Singing, Music Education and Cultural Socialization\" ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (June 2014), pp. 118\u2013120.</ref> Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants.<ref>Trehub, Sandra E., Trainor, Laurel J. \"Singing to infants: lullabies and play songs\" ''Advances in Infancy Research,'' (1998), pp. 43\u201377.</ref> As a result, the music is often simple and repetitive. Lullabies can be found in many countries, and have existed since ancient times.<ref>[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd ed., 1997), p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe term ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|\u028c|l|\u0259|b|a\u026a}}) derives from the [[Middle English]] ''lullen'' (\"to lull\") and ''by''[''e''] (in the sense of \"near\"); it was first recorded circa 1560.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yDdfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4303&dq=lullen+bye+lullaby#v=onepage&q=lullen+bye+lullaby&f=false|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd Edition, Anne H.

When there is harmony, infants almost always prefer consonant intervals over dissonant intervals. Furthermore, if there is a sequence of dissonant intervals in a song, an infant will usually lose interest and it becomes very difficult to regain its attention.<ref>Trainor, Laurel J., Tsang, Christine D., Cheung, Vivian H.W. \"Preference For Sensory Consonance in 2- and 4-month Old Infants.\" ''Musical Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', Vol. 20, No. 2 (Winter 2002), pp. 187\u2013194.</ref> To reflect this, most lullabies contain primarily consonant intervals. Tonally, most lullabies are simple, often merely alternating [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] harmonies.\n\nIn addition to pitch tendencies, lullabies share several structural similarities. The most frequent tendencies are intermittent repetitions and long pauses between sections.<ref name=\"Mitterschiffthaler, M. T. 2007\">Mitterschiffthaler, M. T., Fu, C. H.Y., Dalton, J.

In an observation of the setting of lullabies in Albanian culture, lullabies tended to be paired with the rocking of the child in a cradle. This is reflected in the swinging rhythmicity of the music. In addition to serving as a cultural symbol of the infant's familial status, the cradle's presence during the singing of lullabies helps the infant associate lullabies with falling asleep and waking up.<ref>Doja, Albert. \"Socializing Enchantment: A Socio-Anthropological Approach to Infant-Directed Singing, Music Education and Cultural Socialization\" ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (June 2014), pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==Therapeutic value==\nStudies conducted by Dr. Jeffery Perlman, chief of newborn medicine at [[New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]]'s Komansky Center for Children's Health, find that gentle music therapy not only slows down the heart rate of prematurely delivered infants but also helps them feed and sleep better. This helps them gain weight and speeds their recovery. A study published in May 2013 in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics]]'' under the [[wikt:aegis|aegis]] of the [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] in New York City found that the type of music matters. Therapeutically designed \"live\" music \u2013 and lullabies sung in person \u2013 can influence [[cardiac]] and [[respiratory]] function. Another study published in February 2011 in ''Arts in Psychotherapy'' by Jayne M. Standley of the National Institute for Infant and Child Medical Music Therapy at [[Florida State University]] suggests that babies who receive this kind of therapy leave the hospital sooner.<ref name=clark>{{cite news| url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/lullaby-medicine-premature-babies/story?id=19430621 |last1=Clark| first1=Daniel |last2=Humphries| first2= Rachel| title= Lullaby Medicine for Premature Babies| work= ABC News| date= 18 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAdditional research by Jayne M. Standley has demonstrated that the physiological responses of prematurely delivered infants undergoing intensive care can be regulated by listening to gentle lullabies through headphones. In addition to slowing heart and respiration rates, lullabies have been associated with increased oxygen saturation levels and the possible prevention of potentially life-threatening episodes of apnea and bradycardia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Cassidy| first1= Jane W. |last2= Standley| first2= Jayne M.| title= The Effect of Music Listening on Physiological Responses of Premature Infants in the NICU| journal= Journal of Music Therapy| volume= 32 | pages= 208\u2013227 |number= 4 |year= 1995| doi= 10.1093/jmt/32.4.208 }}</ref> Gentle music can also provide stimulation for premature infants to behave in ways that boost their development and keep them alive. Lullabies can serve as a low-risk source of stimulation and reinforcement for increasing nipple sucking (feeding) rates, providing infants with the nutrition they require for growth and development. Lullabies are thus associated with encouraging the rapid development of the neurological system and with a shorter length of hospitalization.<ref>{{cite journal| last= Standley| first= Jayne M.| title= The effect of music-reinforced non-nutritive sucking on feeding rate of premature infants| journal= Journal of Pediatric Nursing| volume= 18 |number= 3 |date= June 2003| pages= 169\u201373| doi=10.1053/jpdn.2003.34| pmid= 12796858}}</ref>\n\nMore recent research has shown that lullabies sung live can have beneficial effects on physiological functioning and development in premature infants. The live element of a slow, repetitive entrained rhythm can regulate sucking behavior. Infants have a natural tendency to entrain to the sounds that surround them. Beat perception begins during fetal development in the womb and infants are born with an innate musical preference. The element of live breathing sounds can regulate infant heart rate, quiet-alert states, and sleep. Live lullabies can also enhance parent-child bonding, thus decreasing parental stress associated with the intensive care. In short, live lullabies sung by music therapists induce relaxation, rest, comfort, and optimal growth and development.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Loewy| first1= Joanne |last2= Stewart| first2= Kristen| title= The Effects of Music Therapy on Vital Signs, Feeding, and Sleep in Premature Infants| journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]| volume= 131 | number= 5 |date= May 2013| pages= 902\u201318 | doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1367 | pmid=23589814| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMany lullabies, regardless of the meaning of their words, possess a peaceful hypnotic quality. Others are mournful or dark, like a lament. The Gaelic lullaby \"Ba, Ba, Mo Leanabh Beag\" was written in 1848 during the potato famine, which caused much hardship in the Scottish Highlands. The song mentions, soft potatoes, the mother's situation, and her fears for her child.<ref>[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp \"Lullabies and dandlings\", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070706/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp |date=4 October 2013 }}, EducationScotland.gov.uk</ref> In the 1920s, poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] studied Spanish lullabies and noted the \"poetic character\" and \"depth of sadness\" of many of them. Lorca's theory was that a large part of the function of the lullaby is to help a mother vocalize her worries and concerns. In short, they also serve as therapy for the mother.<ref name=perry />\n\nCombined with lament, lullaby can have \"restorative resounding\" properties for hospice inpatients and their families. Lullabies typically soothe people through the awake/sleep transition, and similarly can soothe people through the life/death transition. Music therapists have called these tunes \"lullaments\", that which sustain the spirit, support psychological structure, and enable resilience during times of vulnerability to the effects of adversity. Lullaments are music-contextualized expressions of attachment and detachment, sadness/tears and happiness/laughter, privilege and loss, nurturance and grief, deterioration, stasis and moving forward.<ref>{{cite journal|last= O'Callaghan|first=Clare|title=Lullament: Lullaby and Lament Therapeutic Qualities Actualized Through Music Therapy|journal=[[American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]|volume=25|number=2|date=April\u2013May 2008|pages=93\u201399|doi=10.1177/1049909107310139|pmid=18198359}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Christmas carol]]s are designed as lullabies for the infant Jesus, the most famous of them being \"[[Silent Night]]\". \"Hush Little Baby\" has been observed cross-culturally and is known to have a natural capacity for soothing and energizing infants, as well as nurturing caregiving bonds.<ref name=MTF>{{citation|last= Thompson|first= William F. |title= Music, Thought, and Feeling| edition=2nd| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 2009}}</ref>{{rp| 216}}\n\n==Mother\u2013infant interaction==\nInfants exhibit a natural preference for infant-directed over non-infant-directed lullabies<ref name=Trainor96>{{cite journal| last= Trainor| first= Laurel J. |title= Infant preferences for infant-directed versus noninfant-directed playsongs and lullabies| journal= Infant Behavior and Development| volume= 19| pages= 83\u201392 | number=1| date= January\u2013March 1996 |doi=10.1016/s0163-6383(96)90046-6 }}</ref>{{rp| 83\u201392}} and their own mothers' voice over that of another female.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= DeCasper| first1= Anthony J. |last2= Fifer| first2= William P. |title= Of Human Bonding: Newborns Prefer Their Mothers' Voices| journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume= 208| number=4448 |date= June 1980| pages=1174\u201376 | doi=10.1126/science.7375928 | pmid=7375928| url=http://people.uncw.edu/hungerforda/graduate%20developmental/pdf/decasper.pdf| citeseerx= 10.1.1.553.1738 }}</ref>\n\nMuch research has been generated on the role of lullabies in nurturing caregiving bonds between mother and child. Mothers who sing lullabies to their infants engage in a bonding activity that actually alters the underlying neural structure of the infant brain such that the infant becomes \"tuned\" into music and its association with parental affiliation.<ref name=MTF />{{rp|217}} In one Taiwanese study of Kangaroo Care, a technique practiced on newborn infants in which a mother holds her child tightly against her chest, it was demonstrated that infant\u2013mother dyads who listened to their choice of lullaby were associated with more quiet sleep states and less occurrence of crying by the infant and were also associated with significantly lower maternal anxiety, than those dyads who did not listen to lullabies. The therapeutic effect of lullabies can thus have a strong impact on calming anxieties and nurturing bonds, which is especially important with premature and fragile infants.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Lai, Hui-Ling|author2=Chen, Chia-Jung|author3=Peng, Tai-Chu|author4=Chang, Fwu-Mei|title=Randomized controlled trial of music during kangaroo care on maternal state anxiety and preterm infants' responses|journal=[[International Journal of Nursing Studies]]|volume=43|number=2|date=February 2006|pages=139\u201346|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2005.04.008|pmid=15996669}}</ref> sean mullins recorded his version of lullaby in 1998\n\n==In classical music==\nLullabies written by established [[classical composer]]s are often given the form-name ''[[berceuse]]'', which is French for lullaby, or [[Bassinet|cradle]] song.

Mostly, lullabies are sung in folk languages. Lullabies have been also an integral part of Indian cinema. Many lullabies were written and composed in the fifties, such as:\n\n* \"Aaja Ri Aa Nindiya Tu Aa\" \u2013 ''[[Do Bigha Zamin]]''\n* \"Main Gaoon Tu Chhup Ho Jaa\" \u2013 ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]''\n* \"So Jaa Re Lalna Jhulao Tohe Palna\" \u2013 ''[[Journey Beyond Three Seas]]''\n\nIn the [[Malayalam language]], there is a rich collection of traditional lullabies, known as \"tharaattu Pattu\". One of the most famous is \"[[Omanathinkal Kidavo]]\", written and composed by poet lyricist Iravi Varman Thampi who is widely known as [[Irayimman Thampi]]. This lullaby was written for the queen of [[Travancore]] to sing to her son young prince [[Swathi Thirunal]], who later became the king and a famous musician (composed many [[Keerthana]]s in a [[Ragaa]] [[Dheerasankarabharanam]] commonly known as Sankarabharanam).\n\nIn the [[Odia language]], a lullaby is called a ''Nanabaya gita''.

Soothing words and music helps baby calm down and help them sleep.\n\n====Philippines====\nIn the [[Philippines]], the song is known as the ''oyayi''. The province of [[Batangas]] has a very specialized form of lullaby known as the ''huluna''. Though only composed of simple words, it is notable for being very difficult to sing, due to the lengthy [[melisma]]s. Like many traditional songs from [[Spain]], it is full of [[fioriture]] yet unlike many of the western type songs, it has no time signature.\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], lullabies are called \"b\u00e0i h\u00e1t ru\". One famous Vietnamese lullaby is the song, \"\u1ea6u \u01a1 v\u00ed d\u1ea7u\". Vietnamese lullabies are hard to sing because of their extended [[melismas]]. The lullabies usually include pastoral scenes of villages, bamboo bridges, rice fields, farming, and meals made by a mother. They usually have a melancholy tone.\n\n====China====\nThe \"[[Northeastern Cradle Song]]\" is from northern [[China]], while \"Yueguangguang\" ([[Lang-zh|\u6708\u5149\u5149]]) is from southern China.\n\n====Indonesia====\n\"Nina Bobo\" is from Indonesia.\n\n====Japan====\nThe \"[[Edo Lullaby]]\", \"[[Itsuki Lullaby]]\", \"[[Ch\u016bgoku Region Lullaby]]\", \"[[Shimabara Lullaby]]\" and \"[[Takeda Lullaby]]\" are from Japan.\n\n====Bangladesh====\nIn [[Bangladesh]], the lullaby is termed \"Ghum-Parrani-Gaan\" (song to make sleep).

He collected songs in Moravia and [[Silesia]] as well as in Slavic villages in [[Austria]]. This lullaby uses a specific name of the child, Jan\u00ed\u010dek, a familiar form of the very common male name Jan. Nonsense is employed here, as the boy is promised not only a green and a red apple but also a blue one if he falls asleep.\n\n\"Ukol\u00e9bavka\" (\"Lullaby\") \u2013 This lullaby was published in 1633 in The Informatorium of the School of Infancy by [[Johann Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670). The book is likely to be the first treatise on the development and educating infants and children up to six in the family. Comenius stressed among other things the necessity of sensory and emotional stimuli at an early age. Thus, he included for mothers and nurses the Czech text and the score of the originally German lullaby by 16th century preacher Mathesius.\n\n\"Hajej, m\u016fj and\u00edlku\" (\"Sleep, My Little Angel\") \u2013 This is one of the most melodious Czech lullabies, first collected by [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]] (1811\u20131870), Czech romantic writer, poet and collector of Czech folk songs and fairy tales. The text refers specifically to the mother rocking her baby.\n\n\"Hal\u00ed, d\u00edt\u011b\" (\"Hullee, baby\") \u2013 This lullaby was collected by [[Franti\u0161ek Barto\u0161 (folklorist)|Franti\u0161ek Barto\u0161]] (1837\u20131906), pedagogue and ethnographer who collected Moravian songs. The second line says the carer will leave after the child falls asleep, but in the third line we learn that only to the garden in the valley to pick raspberries.\n\n\"Halaj, belaj, malu\u010dk\u00fd\" (\"Sleep, Sleep, Little One\") \u2013 This lullaby is from the east of Moravia, where the dialect is influenced by the Slovak language, and also folk songs are similar to the Slovak ones from across the border. A boy is promised the essential food for infants, ka\u0161i\u010dka, a smooth mixture made of milk and flour.\n\n====Danish ====\n\"Elefantens vuggevise\" (\"The Elephant's Lullaby\") \u2013 This lullaby is considered one of the most popular lullabies in Denmark. Using exotic animals as theme, the lyrics are simple and easily understood by a child. It was made politically correct in the 1990s: The word ''negerdreng'' (Negro boy) was changed to kokosn\u00f8d (coconut).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Statsl%C3%A6re_og_politisk_videnskabsteori/politisk_korrekthed | title=politisk korrekthed \u2013 Gyldendal \u2013 Den Store Danske | publisher=Gyldendal | work=Den Store Danske | accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> The song was written in 1948 by the Danish writer and poet Harald H.

Sigurd usually sings this song at the end of his children's show. This lullaby has sleeping time as theme: The day is over and we must sleep and rest so we will be fresh again in the morning.\n\n\"Mues sang f\u00e5 Hansemand\" (\"Mother's Song to Little Hans\") \u2013 This lullaby originated from south [[Jutland]] and is very old (year of composition is unknown). It is not well known in Denmark. This may, in part, be due to the fact that it was written in Jutlandic dialect. The lyrics were written by Marie Thulesen (1878\u20131924) with music by the Danish musician Oluf Ring (1884\u20131946).\n\n\"Jeg vil t\u00e6lle stjernerne\" (\"I Will Count the Stars\") \u2013 This lullaby was written in 1951 by the Danish poet and writer [[Halfdan Rasmussen]] (1915\u20132002). Rasmussen had written numerous rhymes and jingles, some of which are still being used in Danish beginner classes in public schools (e.g. the picture book \"Halfdans ABC\"). This lullaby's music was composed by Hans Dalgaard (1919\u201381). The song is a simple story of a child who tries to count the stars with his/her fingers and toes.\n\n====Dutch ====\n\"Slaap kindje slaap\" \u2013 The text is mostly chosen for its rhyme. Sleep, little child, sleep. Outside a sheep is walking. A sheep with white feet, it drinks its milk so sweet.\n\n\"Maantje tuurt, maantje gluurt\" \u2013 Older Dutch lullaby. Look the moon peeps and spies through the window. Have the children already gone to bed? Yes moon, they're lying in bed.

The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies they are used to pass down cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants' undivided attention, modulation of infants' arousal, and regulation of behavior.<ref>Doja, Albert. \"Socializing Enchantment: A Socio-Anthropological Approach to Infant-Directed Singing, Music Education and Cultural Socialization\" ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (June 2014), pp. 118\u2013120.</ref> Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants.<ref>Trehub, Sandra E., Trainor, Laurel J. \"Singing to infants: lullabies and play songs\" ''Advances in Infancy Research,'' (1998), pp. 43\u201377.</ref> As a result, the music is often simple and repetitive.

When there is harmony, infants almost always prefer consonant intervals over dissonant intervals. Furthermore, if there is a sequence of dissonant intervals in a song, an infant will usually lose interest and it becomes very difficult to regain its attention.<ref>Trainor, Laurel J., Tsang, Christine D., Cheung, Vivian H.W. \"Preference For Sensory Consonance in 2- and 4-month Old Infants.\" ''Musical Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', Vol. 20, No. 2 (Winter 2002), pp. 187\u2013194.</ref> To reflect this, most lullabies contain primarily consonant intervals. Tonally, most lullabies are simple, often merely alternating [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] harmonies.\n\nIn addition to pitch tendencies, lullabies share several structural similarities. The most frequent tendencies are intermittent repetitions and long pauses between sections.<ref name=\"Mitterschiffthaler, M. T. 2007\">Mitterschiffthaler, M. T., Fu, C. H.Y., Dalton, J.

Lullabies are usually in triple meter or 6/8 time, giving them a \"characteristic swinging or rocking motion.\" <ref name=perry>{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21035103 |last= Perry| first= Nina| title= The universal language of lullabies| work=BBC News|date= 20 January 2013}}</ref> This mimics the movement a baby experiences in the womb as a mother moves. In addition, infants' preference for rhythm shares a strong connection with what they hear when they are bounced, and even their own body movements.<ref>Pouthas, V. \" The development of the perception of time and temporal regulation of action in infants and children\" ''Musical beginnings: Origins and development of musical competence'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 115\u2013141.</ref> The tempos of lullabies tend to be generally slow, and the utterances are short.<ref name=\"Doja, Albert 2014 p. 120\"/> Again, this aids in the infant's processing of the song.\n\nLullabies almost never have instrumental accompaniments. Infants have shown a strong preference for unaccompanied lullabies over accompanied lullabies.<ref>Ilari, Beatriz and Sundara, Megha. \"Music Listening Preferences in Early Life: Infants' Responses to Accompanied versus Unaccompanied Singing\" ''[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]'', Vol. 56, No. 4 (January 2009), p. 356.</ref> Again, this appeals to infants' more limited ability to process information.\n\nLullabies are often used for their soothing nature, even for non-infants. One study found lullabies to be the most successful type of music or sound for relieving stress and improving the overall psychological health of pregnant women.<ref>Chang, Mei-Yueh; Chen, Chung-Hey; Huang Kuo-Feng, \"Effects of music therapy on psychological health of women during pregnancy\" ''Journal of Clinical Nursing'', Vol. 17, No. 19 (October 2008), pp. 2580\u20132587.</ref>\n\nThese characteristics tend to be consistent across cultures. It was found that adults of various cultural backgrounds could recognize and identify lullabies without knowing the cultural context of the song.<ref name=\"Mitterschiffthaler, M. T. 2007\"/> Infants have shown a strong preferences for songs with these qualities.<ref name=Trainor96 />{{rp|19}}\n\n==Cross-cultural prevalence==\nLullabies are often used to pass down or strengthen the cultural roles and practices. In an observation of the setting of lullabies in Albanian culture, lullabies tended to be paired with the rocking of the child in a cradle. This is reflected in the swinging rhythmicity of the music. In addition to serving as a cultural symbol of the infant's familial status, the cradle's presence during the singing of lullabies helps the infant associate lullabies with falling asleep and waking up.<ref>Doja, Albert. \"Socializing Enchantment: A Socio-Anthropological Approach to Infant-Directed Singing, Music Education and Cultural Socialization\" ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (June 2014), pp. 118\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==Therapeutic value==\nStudies conducted by Dr. Jeffery Perlman, chief of newborn medicine at [[New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]]'s Komansky Center for Children's Health, find that gentle music therapy not only slows down the heart rate of prematurely delivered infants but also helps them feed and sleep better. This helps them gain weight and speeds their recovery. A study published in May 2013 in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics]]'' under the [[wikt:aegis|aegis]] of the [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] in New York City found that the type of music matters. Therapeutically designed \"live\" music \u2013 and lullabies sung in person \u2013 can influence [[cardiac]] and [[respiratory]] function. Another study published in February 2011 in ''Arts in Psychotherapy'' by Jayne M. Standley of the National Institute for Infant and Child Medical Music Therapy at [[Florida State University]] suggests that babies who receive this kind of therapy leave the hospital sooner.<ref name=clark>{{cite news| url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/lullaby-medicine-premature-babies/story?id=19430621 |last1=Clark| first1=Daniel |last2=Humphries| first2= Rachel| title= Lullaby Medicine for Premature Babies| work= ABC News| date= 18 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAdditional research by Jayne M. Standley has demonstrated that the physiological responses of prematurely delivered infants undergoing intensive care can be regulated by listening to gentle lullabies through headphones. In addition to slowing heart and respiration rates, lullabies have been associated with increased oxygen saturation levels and the possible prevention of potentially life-threatening episodes of apnea and bradycardia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Cassidy| first1= Jane W. |last2= Standley| first2= Jayne M.| title= The Effect of Music Listening on Physiological Responses of Premature Infants in the NICU| journal= Journal of Music Therapy| volume= 32 | pages= 208\u2013227 |number= 4 |year= 1995| doi= 10.1093/jmt/32.4.208 }}</ref> Gentle music can also provide stimulation for premature infants to behave in ways that boost their development and keep them alive. Lullabies can serve as a low-risk source of stimulation and reinforcement for increasing nipple sucking (feeding) rates, providing infants with the nutrition they require for growth and development. Lullabies are thus associated with encouraging the rapid development of the neurological system and with a shorter length of hospitalization.<ref>{{cite journal| last= Standley| first= Jayne M.| title= The effect of music-reinforced non-nutritive sucking on feeding rate of premature infants| journal= Journal of Pediatric Nursing| volume= 18 |number= 3 |date= June 2003| pages= 169\u201373| doi=10.1053/jpdn.2003.34| pmid= 12796858}}</ref>\n\nMore recent research has shown that lullabies sung live can have beneficial effects on physiological functioning and development in premature infants. The live element of a slow, repetitive entrained rhythm can regulate sucking behavior. Infants have a natural tendency to entrain to the sounds that surround them. Beat perception begins during fetal development in the womb and infants are born with an innate musical preference. The element of live breathing sounds can regulate infant heart rate, quiet-alert states, and sleep. Live lullabies can also enhance parent-child bonding, thus decreasing parental stress associated with the intensive care. In short, live lullabies sung by music therapists induce relaxation, rest, comfort, and optimal growth and development.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Loewy| first1= Joanne |last2= Stewart| first2= Kristen| title= The Effects of Music Therapy on Vital Signs, Feeding, and Sleep in Premature Infants| journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]| volume= 131 | number= 5 |date= May 2013| pages= 902\u201318 | doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1367 | pmid=23589814| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMany lullabies, regardless of the meaning of their words, possess a peaceful hypnotic quality. Others are mournful or dark, like a lament. The Gaelic lullaby \"Ba, Ba, Mo Leanabh Beag\" was written in 1848 during the potato famine, which caused much hardship in the Scottish Highlands. The song mentions, soft potatoes, the mother's situation, and her fears for her child.<ref>[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp \"Lullabies and dandlings\", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070706/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp |date=4 October 2013 }}, EducationScotland.gov.uk</ref> In the 1920s, poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] studied Spanish lullabies and noted the \"poetic character\" and \"depth of sadness\" of many of them. Lorca's theory was that a large part of the function of the lullaby is to help a mother vocalize her worries and concerns. In short, they also serve as therapy for the mother.<ref name=perry />\n\nCombined with lament, lullaby can have \"restorative resounding\" properties for hospice inpatients and their families. Lullabies typically soothe people through the awake/sleep transition, and similarly can soothe people through the life/death transition. Music therapists have called these tunes \"lullaments\", that which sustain the spirit, support psychological structure, and enable resilience during times of vulnerability to the effects of adversity. Lullaments are music-contextualized expressions of attachment and detachment, sadness/tears and happiness/laughter, privilege and loss, nurturance and grief, deterioration, stasis and moving forward.<ref>{{cite journal|last= O'Callaghan|first=Clare|title=Lullament: Lullaby and Lament Therapeutic Qualities Actualized Through Music Therapy|journal=[[American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]|volume=25|number=2|date=April\u2013May 2008|pages=93\u201399|doi=10.1177/1049909107310139|pmid=18198359}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Christmas carol]]s are designed as lullabies for the infant Jesus, the most famous of them being \"[[Silent Night]]\". \"Hush Little Baby\" has been observed cross-culturally and is known to have a natural capacity for soothing and energizing infants, as well as nurturing caregiving bonds.<ref name=MTF>{{citation|last= Thompson|first= William F. |title= Music, Thought, and Feeling| edition=2nd| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 2009}}</ref>{{rp| 216}}\n\n==Mother\u2013infant interaction==\nInfants exhibit a natural preference for infant-directed over non-infant-directed lullabies<ref name=Trainor96>{{cite journal| last= Trainor| first= Laurel J. |title= Infant preferences for infant-directed versus noninfant-directed playsongs and lullabies| journal= Infant Behavior and Development| volume= 19| pages= 83\u201392 | number=1| date= January\u2013March 1996 |doi=10.1016/s0163-6383(96)90046-6 }}</ref>{{rp| 83\u201392}} and their own mothers' voice over that of another female.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= DeCasper| first1= Anthony J. |last2= Fifer| first2= William P. |title= Of Human Bonding: Newborns Prefer Their Mothers' Voices| journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume= 208| number=4448 |date= June 1980| pages=1174\u201376 | doi=10.1126/science.7375928 | pmid=7375928| url=http://people.uncw.edu/hungerforda/graduate%20developmental/pdf/decasper.pdf| citeseerx= 10.1.1.553.1738 }}</ref>\n\nMuch research has been generated on the role of lullabies in nurturing caregiving bonds between mother and child. Mothers who sing lullabies to their infants engage in a bonding activity that actually alters the underlying neural structure of the infant brain such that the infant becomes \"tuned\" into music and its association with parental affiliation.<ref name=MTF />{{rp|217}} In one Taiwanese study of Kangaroo Care, a technique practiced on newborn infants in which a mother holds her child tightly against her chest, it was demonstrated that infant\u2013mother dyads who listened to their choice of lullaby were associated with more quiet sleep states and less occurrence of crying by the infant and were also associated with significantly lower maternal anxiety, than those dyads who did not listen to lullabies. The therapeutic effect of lullabies can thus have a strong impact on calming anxieties and nurturing bonds, which is especially important with premature and fragile infants.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Lai, Hui-Ling|author2=Chen, Chia-Jung|author3=Peng, Tai-Chu|author4=Chang, Fwu-Mei|title=Randomized controlled trial of music during kangaroo care on maternal state anxiety and preterm infants' responses|journal=[[International Journal of Nursing Studies]]|volume=43|number=2|date=February 2006|pages=139\u201346|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2005.04.008|pmid=15996669}}</ref>\n\n==In classical music==\nLullabies written by established [[classical composer]]s are often given the form-name ''[[berceuse]]'', which is French for lullaby, or [[Bassinet|cradle]] song. The most famous lullaby is the one by [[Johannes Brahms]] (\"[[Brahms' Lullaby|Wiegenlied]]\", 1868). While there has been no confirmation, there are many strong arguments that Brahms suffered from a sleep disorder known as [[sleep apnea]].

Mostly, lullabies are sung in folk languages. Lullabies have been also an integral part of Indian cinema. Many lullabies were written and composed in the fifties, such as:\n\n* \"Aaja Ri Aa Nindiya Tu Aa\" \u2013 ''[[Do Bigha Zamin]]''\n* \"Main Gaoon Tu Chhup Ho Jaa\" \u2013 ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]''\n* \"So Jaa Re Lalna Jhulao Tohe Palna\" \u2013 ''[[Journey Beyond Three Seas]]''\n\nIn the [[Malayalam language]], there is a rich collection of traditional lullabies, known as \"tharaattu Pattu\". One of the most famous is \"[[Omanathinkal Kidavo]]\", written and composed by poet lyricist Iravi Varman Thampi who is widely known as [[Irayimman Thampi]]. This lullaby was written for the queen of [[Travancore]] to sing to her son young prince [[Swathi Thirunal]], who later became the king and a famous musician (composed many [[Keerthana]]s in a [[Ragaa]] [[Dheerasankarabharanam]] commonly known as Sankarabharanam).\n\nIn the [[Odia language]], a lullaby is called a ''Nanabaya gita''.

A famous Telugu lullaby is \"jo achuthaa nanda jo jo mukunda\".\n\nIn the [[Tamil language]], a lullaby is called a ''thaalattu'' (''thal'' means \"tongue\"). A melodious sound is created by frequent movement of the tongue at the beginning of the song.\n\nIn the [[Marathi language]], a lullaby is called a ''angai geet''. Soothing words and music helps baby calm down and help them sleep.\n\n====Philippines====\nIn the [[Philippines]], the song is known as the ''oyayi''. The province of [[Batangas]] has a very specialized form of lullaby known as the ''huluna''. Though only composed of simple words, it is notable for being very difficult to sing, due to the lengthy [[melisma]]s. Like many traditional songs from [[Spain]], it is full of [[fioriture]] yet unlike many of the western type songs, it has no time signature.\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], lullabies are called \"b\u00e0i h\u00e1t ru\". One famous Vietnamese lullaby is the song, \"\u1ea6u \u01a1 v\u00ed d\u1ea7u\". Vietnamese lullabies are hard to sing because of their extended [[melismas]]. The lullabies usually include pastoral scenes of villages, bamboo bridges, rice fields, farming, and meals made by a mother. They usually have a melancholy tone.\n\n====China====\nThe \"[[Northeastern Cradle Song]]\" is from northern [[China]], while \"Yueguangguang\" ([[Lang-zh|\u6708\u5149\u5149]]) is from southern China.\n\n====Indonesia====\n\"Nina Bobo\" is from Indonesia.\n\n====Japan====\nThe \"[[Edo Lullaby]]\", \"[[Itsuki Lullaby]]\", \"[[Ch\u016bgoku Region Lullaby]]\", \"[[Shimabara Lullaby]]\" and \"[[Takeda Lullaby]]\" are from Japan.\n\n====Bangladesh====\nIn [[Bangladesh]], the lullaby is termed \"Ghum-Parrani-Gaan\" (song to make sleep). Examples of Bangla lullabies are \"Ghum-Parrani Maashi, Pishi\" and \"Baash baganer mathar upor\".<ref>Burnard, P.; Mackinlay, E.; Powell, K.; The Routledge International Handbook of Intercultural Arts Research.

The manuscript dates from the late 13th century, but was likely copied from a 9th-century original, itself likely recording poems transmitted through [[oral tradition]].\n\nMany medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form of a lullaby, including \"[[Lullay, mine liking|Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting]]\" and may be versions of contemporary lullabies.<ref name=\"M. Prichard, 1984 pp. 326\">{{citation| first1= H. |last1= Carpenter |first2= M. |last2= Prichard| title= The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 1984|page= 326}}</ref> However, most of those used today date from the seventeenth century onwards, and some of the best known English-language lullabies originate from the US. Notable English language lullabies include \"[[Bye, baby Bunting]]\", \"[[Scottish Lullaby]]\", \"[[Suo G\u00e2n]]\" (Welsh Lullaby), and \"[[Hush, Little Baby]]\".\n\nThere are many lullabies in Scottish song tradition, with well-known examples in Scottish Gaelic, Scots and English.  They include songs which express emotions other than affection for the child \u2013 notably \"[[Griogal Cridhe]]\", which commemorates the beheading of Gregor Roy MacGregor by his father-in-law, Campbell of Glenlyon and brother-in-law in 1570 and \"Hishie Ba\" which may refer to a gang assault.  A number of traditional lullabies also express social issues and this has been continued in modern lullaby writing in Scotland, notably Jim MacLean's \"Smile in Your Sleep\" (also known as \"Hush, Hush, Time to Be Sleeping\"), Matt McGinn's \"Miner's Lullaby\" (also known as \"Coorie Doon\") and Karine Polwart's \"Baleerie Baloo\".  Christina Stewart's kist o dreams project provides a resource of over 30 Scottish lullabies, ranging from Doric Scots of the North East, to Northern Isles dialect of Shetland, Scottish Gaelic and English language examples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kistodreams.org/|title=Kist O'Dreams &#124; Home|website=www.kistodreams.org}}</ref>\n\n====Czech====\n\"Spi, Jan\u00ed\u010dku, spi\" (\"Sleep, Johny, sleep\") \u2013 This playful lullaby was collected in [[Moravia]] by [[Franti\u0161ek Su\u0161il]] (1804\u20131868), a priest and an activist of Czech national revival. He collected songs in Moravia and [[Silesia]] as well as in Slavic villages in [[Austria]]. This lullaby uses a specific name of the child, Jan\u00ed\u010dek, a familiar form of the very common male name Jan. Nonsense is employed here, as the boy is promised not only a green and a red apple but also a blue one if he falls asleep.\n\n\"Ukol\u00e9bavka\" (\"Lullaby\") \u2013 This lullaby was published in 1633 in The Informatorium of the School of Infancy by [[Johann Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670). The book is likely to be the first treatise on the development and educating infants and children up to six in the family. Comenius stressed among other things the necessity of sensory and emotional stimuli at an early age. Thus, he included for mothers and nurses the Czech text and the score of the originally German lullaby by 16th century preacher Mathesius.\n\n\"Hajej, m\u016fj and\u00edlku\" (\"Sleep, My Little Angel\") \u2013 This is one of the most melodious Czech lullabies, first collected by [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]] (1811\u20131870), Czech romantic writer, poet and collector of Czech folk songs and fairy tales. The text refers specifically to the mother rocking her baby.\n\n\"Hal\u00ed, d\u00edt\u011b\" (\"Hullee, baby\") \u2013 This lullaby was collected by [[Franti\u0161ek Barto\u0161 (folklorist)|Franti\u0161ek Barto\u0161]] (1837\u20131906), pedagogue and ethnographer who collected Moravian songs. The second line says the carer will leave after the child falls asleep, but in the third line we learn that only to the garden in the valley to pick raspberries.\n\n\"Halaj, belaj, malu\u010dk\u00fd\" (\"Sleep, Sleep, Little One\") \u2013 This lullaby is from the east of Moravia, where the dialect is influenced by the Slovak language, and also folk songs are similar to the Slovak ones from across the border. A boy is promised the essential food for infants, ka\u0161i\u010dka, a smooth mixture made of milk and flour.\n\n====Danish ====\n\"Elefantens vuggevise\" (\"The Elephant's Lullaby\") \u2013 This lullaby is considered one of the most popular lullabies in Denmark. Using exotic animals as theme, the lyrics are simple and easily understood by a child. It was made politically correct in the 1990s: The word ''negerdreng'' (Negro boy) was changed to kokosn\u00f8d (coconut).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Statsl%C3%A6re_og_politisk_videnskabsteori/politisk_korrekthed | title=politisk korrekthed \u2013 Gyldendal \u2013 Den Store Danske | publisher=Gyldendal | work=Den Store Danske | accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> The song was written in 1948 by the Danish writer and poet Harald H. Lund with music composed by writer-musician Mogens Jermiin Nissen (1906\u201372).\n\n\"Godnatsang\" (\"Goodnight Song\") \u2013 This is a popular lullaby that was composed (lyrics and music) by [[Sigurd Barrett]] (born 1967), pianist, composer and host of a children's TV programme in Denmark, and fellow musician Steen Nikolaj Hansen. Sigurd usually sings this song at the end of his children's show. This lullaby has sleeping time as theme: The day is over and we must sleep and rest so we will be fresh again in the morning.\n\n\"Mues sang f\u00e5 Hansemand\" (\"Mother's Song to Little Hans\") \u2013 This lullaby originated from south [[Jutland]] and is very old (year of composition is unknown). It is not well known in Denmark. This may, in part, be due to the fact that it was written in Jutlandic dialect. The lyrics were written by Marie Thulesen (1878\u20131924) with music by the Danish musician Oluf Ring (1884\u20131946).\n\n\"Jeg vil t\u00e6lle stjernerne\" (\"I Will Count the Stars\") \u2013 This lullaby was written in 1951 by the Danish poet and writer [[Halfdan Rasmussen]] (1915\u20132002). Rasmussen had written numerous rhymes and jingles, some of which are still being used in Danish beginner classes in public schools (e.g. the picture book \"Halfdans ABC\"). This lullaby's music was composed by Hans Dalgaard (1919\u201381). The song is a simple story of a child who tries to count the stars with his/her fingers and toes.\n\n====Dutch ====\n\"Slaap kindje slaap\" \u2013 The text is mostly chosen for its rhyme. Sleep, little child, sleep. Outside a sheep is walking. A sheep with white feet, it drinks its milk so sweet.\n\n\"Maantje tuurt, maantje gluurt\" \u2013 Older Dutch lullaby. Look the moon peeps and spies through the window. Have the children already gone to bed? Yes moon, they're lying in bed. Good, tomorrow will be a new day of playing and learning.\n\n\"Suja suja kindje\" \u2013 The child is spoken to. Is your stomach aching or do you have cold feet? We will make a fire, make porridge. The cradle is rocking.\n\n\"Suze Naanje, ik waige die\" \u2013 Also the child is spoken to in this lullaby. I rock you, but if you were older I would slap you. The language is [[Gronings]] dialect.\n\n==== German ====\n\"[[Der Mond ist aufgegangen]]\" (\"The moon has risen\"), \"[[Guten Abend, gute Nacht]]\" (\"Good evening, good night\"), \"[[Wei\u00dft du, wie viel Sternlein stehen]]\" (\"Do you know how many stars there are?\") and \"[[Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf]]\" (\"Sleep, dear child, sleep\") became widely known in the 18th and 19th century and still are.\n\n====Irish====\n\nThe [[Kildare Poems]] (mid-14th century), among the earliest [[English language]] literature in Ireland, include the lullaby ''Lollai, Lollai, litil child''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/E300000-001/text010.html|title=Part 10 of Anglo-Irish poems of the Middle Ages: The Kildare Poems|website=celt.ucc.ie}}</ref>\n\n\"I've Found My Bonny Babe a Nest\" was published in 1901 by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]; it is believed to be much older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/get_text.html?TextId=117225|title=Lullaby (Graves, set by Charles Villiers Stanford, Sir) (The LiederNet Archive: Texts and Translations to Lieder, m\u00e9lodies, canzoni, and other classical vocal music)|website=www.lieder.net}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral|Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral (That's an Irish Lullaby)]]\" is a famous fictional Irish lullaby, written in 1913 by the [[Irish-American]] composer [[James Royce Shannon]].\n\n\"Whisht Wee Bairn\" ('be quiet, small child') is an [[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]] lullaby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/WhishtWeeBairn/Home.php|title=An Ulster-Scots Lullaby (Whisht Wee Bairn)|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Seoith\u00edn Seoth\u00f3\" (Hushaby, Hush; also spelled ''Se\u00f3 h\u00edn se\u00f3, Shoheen Sho'') is a noted [[Irish language]] lullaby.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uPo0oB19gDUC&pg=PA207&dq=Seoith%C3%ADn+Seoth%C3%B3#v=onepage&q=Seoith%C3%ADn+Seoth%C3%B3&f=false|title=A Dictionary of Hiberno-English: The Irish Use of English|first=T.

The club runs four senior teams, two academy teams and a full range of  junior teams.<ref name=\"Club History\">[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/tringrugby/ Club website teams page]</ref> The first XV currently plays in [[London 1 North]].\n\n==History==\nTring Rugby Union Football Club was founded in 1963 by commuters, Arthur Howlett, Donald Dover, Peter Hutton, Mike Hulme and local Doctors, David Thallon, Adams and Knox, who formed a team from replies to adverts in local newspapers. In September of the same year Arthurs son Stephen Howlett, who attended Tring's Mortimer Hill Secondary School established a junior team. Making history by pioneering the first rugby club in the UK to have a children's youth team mainly formed from the Tring & Berkhamsted schools 1st year football teams and playing at Kingsley Farm set between Manor Road and Meadow Close, Tring (Now known as Kingsley Walk). Playing their first game against Stoke Mandeville with the senior team playing the 1964\u201365 season having co founder Doctor Knox kicking off their first game against Balcavians now Stevenage RUFC\n \nIn recent years the club has progressed up the league system, reaching the fifth tier in 2008. The club has played at that level ever since playing in the National 3 London South East Premier.\n\nChief amongst those setting up the club's future was a New Zealander, [[Mark Otway]], who had been relocated to the UK for business and had settled in Tring. Otway was the first club captain and had enjoyed rugby at all levels in his native New Zealand, becoming an All Blacks trialist as well as making the country's Davis Cup tennis squad. Otway brought tales of life at the rugby clubs in New Zealand where a core part of the club's set up was based around children playing the game. This was unheard of in England, where rugby at junior level was played only at schools, and primarily fee paying ones at that. Tring liked what Otway had to say about bringing youth into the club and developing a community feel long before the phrase minis rugby was dreamed up. Members of that first youth and junior team are still active in the club today \u2013 a whole rugby career later.\n\nAs the town expanded the council compulsorily purchased the original site so it could become Dundale School and, in search of a new home, the club approached another local landowner, the show jumper Dorian Williams who owned the estate at Pendley, on the eastern edge of the town, close to the club's roots at Tring Station. Williams had a philanthropic vision for a cultural centre in Tring that comprised an arts centre, now the popular Court Theatre, an adult education college, which was located in Pendley Manor itself before it became a hotel and a sports centre which would be home to many of the towns sporting teams. Williams welcomed the club with open arms and they established a base alongside Tring Town Football Club (now home to Tring Athletic). By this time fielding two regular teams as well as a growing junior section, moved to the site in the early 1970s and were soon joined by the town's athletics, hockey, squash and bowls clubs at the burgeoning Cow Lane complex.\n\nFacilities were little better at Cow Lane, the changing rooms were still in a cow shed, all be it enclosed, and the showers still a very \u201cHeath Robinson\u201d affair until eventually they managed to get hold of a large amount of concrete and install a lunge plunge bath into the building.\n\nA few years after starting life at Pendley the club had raised enough money to erect a pre-fabricated unit to act as a changing room cum clubhouse and on 13 April 1975 the club hosted its Ground Opening match when Tring took on an International XV which included many star names of the time. The building remained in this use until the mid-1980s when the plans for a purpose built clubhouse were drawn up. The current clubhouse was opened in 1984 and the old clubhouse became the dedicated changing rooms until five years later when they made way for the brick built ones seen on site today. Success has been endemic throughout the club for many years but the achievements of the first team since the turn of the century have caught many peoples eye.\n\nIn 2003\u201304 they won their league [[Herts/Middlesex 1]], losing only game all year and then repeated the feat in 2004\u201305 by winning London Four (north west), again losing just one game all season. In 2005\u201306 they competed in London Three (North West) against other local teams such as Harpenden, Welwyn and Fullerians, based in Watford, as well as teams from north and west London. They were runners up to Woodford at the end of the season and beat Norfolk side Diss (runners up in London 3 North East) in a play off match to achieve their third successive promotion up to London 2 North. The season also saw the club advance to its furthest position in the RFU's national Intermediate Cup competition where they reached the quarterfinals, losing to eventual cup-winners Stockport.\n\nIn comparison, the 2006\u201307 season was something of a disappointment although in reality a massive achievement for the club. They led London 2 north for long periods of the season, only to be over hauled by a strong Civil Service side in the last quarter. Tring were again runners up in the league and faced another play off to secure a fifth successive promotion. Their opponents were London 2 south side Thanet looking to make a return to London 1 having been relegated the previous year. Alas for Tring the luck was against them on the day and they lost to Thanet in one of the most compelling matches held at Cow Lane in front of nearly 650 spectators.\nNot deterred Tring attacked the 2007\u201308 season from the start and were part of the leading pack all season. In the end they edged past Staines and Chingford to take the league title and gain promotion to [[National League 3 London & SELondon 1]] for 2008\u201309 \u2014 this is level five on the rugby pyramid and the highest level the club has ever performed at.\n\nThe club fields three other sides on a regular basis, along with an occasional vets side for the over 35's. After several years unbeaten in the Herts / Middlesex Merit Tables the second team now play in the highly competitive Canterbury Shield where they take on teams from across the region. The third and fourth teams continue in the Merit Tables. With so many sides to choose from there is rugby in Tring on offer to anyone and everyone who wants to play the game no matter what age or standard.\n\nThe success of the England national team at the 2003 IRB World Cup, development of the game for girls and the growing trend amongst parents that rugby is a \u2018nicer\u2019 sport for their children to be involved with has led to an increase in membership for the club's mini and junior section. This season over 630 children between the ages of 3 to 16 regularly played or trained at the club. At this level fixtures are mostly made up of mini tournaments or festivals where several clubs will bring players covering several age groups to the club for a day of rugby. Every year, in March, Tring host an annual festival for Mini Rugby with 72 clubs from throughout the South East region compete and over 1400 children take part. Supported by a strong social network of parent & volunteer coaches and game officials within the club and those that aren't involved with coaching or watching will often sit in the clubhouse enjoying a tea or coffee or having a libation with family and friends while watching a game.\n\nAs an amateur organisation the club is supported by the parents of mini and junior players, the senior players; who pay match fees every week, and the generosity of a large band of Vice Presidents \u2013 a level of club membership which is supported by regular match day dinners and other events throughout the year. There are also contributory schemes with prize funds to increase revenue.\n\nIn June 2007 the club developed work on the TringRugby project, which sees the sections of the club; Tiger Cubs, Mini & Junior, Colts Academy, returning students and Seniors, amalgamate to form one strong club identity in inspiring its community youth to take up activity rugby sports.<ref name=\"Club History\"/>\n\n==Honours==\n* [[Hertfordshire Presidents' Trophy]] winners (3): 2002, 2003, 2004\n* [[Herts/Middlesex 1]] champions: 2003\u201304\n* [[London 3 North West|London Division 4 North West]] champions: 2004\u201305\n* [[London 2 North West#Promotion play-offs|London 2 (north-east v north-west)]] promotion playoff winners: 2005-06\n* [[London 1 North]] champions (2): 2007\u201308, 2016\u201317\n* [[Hertfordshire Presidents' Cup]] winners: 2012\n\n<ref name=\"Club History\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/tringrugby/ Official club website]\n\n{{Rugby union in England}}\n\n[[Category:English rugby union teams]]\n[[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1963]]\n[[Category:Rugby union in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Tring]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rugby team\n  | teamname       = Tring RUFC\n  | image          = Tring_Rugby.png\n  | imagesize      = 200px\n  | union          = [[Hertfordshire Rugby Football Union|Hertfordshire RFU]]\n  | fullname       = Tring Rugby Union Football Club\n  | nickname       = Tring Rangers\n  | motto          = Oppugnar Defenda - Attack To Defend\n  | countryflag    = England\n  | countryflagvar =\n  | founded        = {{start date and age|1963}}\n  | location       = [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]\n  | region         = South East\n  | ground         = Pendley Sports Centre, Cow Lane\n  | capacity       = 750\n  | chairman       = John Ball\n  | ceo            =\n  | president      = Martyn Kirk\n  | captain        = \n  | coach          = Giles Wallis\n  | top scorer     =\n  | caps           =\n  | url            = http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/tringrugby/\n  | league         = [[London & South East Premier]]\n  | season         = 2018\u201319\n  | position       = 4th\n}}\n\n'''Tring Rugby Club''' is an [[England|English]] [[rugby union]] team based in [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]].
