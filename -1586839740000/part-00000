Recordings of the name from London Church Registers include: the christening of Thomas Courtney at All Hallows, London Wall, on 11 November 1569, and the marriage of William Courtney and Mary Lucas on 22 March 1590, at St Dunstan's, Stepney. John Courtney and his wife, Sybill, were early immigrants to America, leaving London on the ''Paule'' in July 1635, bound for Virginia. An early [[coat of arms]] granted to the family depicts a blue fesse between three torteaux on a gold shield. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Reginald de Curtenay, which was dated 1164, in \"Feudal Documents from the Abbey of [[Bury St Edmunds]]\", Suffolk, during the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]].\n\n==People with the surname==\n\n* [[Brendan Courtney]], Irish television presenter\n* [[Charles E.

It has two quite distinct interpretations: firstly, the surname may be locational, from places called Courtenay in the regions of [[Loiret]] and [[G\u00e2tinais]]. The [[House of Courtenay]] was a significant French family with close association with both the French, and thereby, English royal lines; in England the Courtenays were [[Earls of Devon]].\n\nSecondly, in some cases, bearers of the surname may be of Irish descent, since Courtney is also an Anglicized form of the Gaelic \"O'Curnain\", descendant of Curnan, from an Old Irish personal name of obscure origins. Recordings of the name from London Church Registers include: the christening of Thomas Courtney at All Hallows, London Wall, on 11 November 1569, and the marriage of William Courtney and Mary Lucas on 22 March 1590, at St Dunstan's, Stepney. John Courtney and his wife, Sybill, were early immigrants to America, leaving London on the ''Paule'' in July 1635, bound for Virginia. An early [[coat of arms]] granted to the family depicts a blue fesse between three torteaux on a gold shield. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Reginald de Curtenay, which was dated 1164, in \"Feudal Documents from the Abbey of [[Bury St Edmunds]]\", Suffolk, during the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]].\n\n==People with the surname==\n\n* [[Brendan Courtney]], Irish television presenter\n* [[Charles E.

This was the final postseason that held a best-of-5 first-round series; the [[2003 NBA Playoffs]] saw those series expand to a best-of-7 format. The tournament concluded with the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] defeating the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[New Jersey Nets]] 4 games to 0. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] for the third straight year.\n\nThis year marked the return of playoff success for the [[Boston Celtics]], who had last made the playoffs in [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995]], won their last playoff series in 1992 and made their last Eastern Conference Finals appearance in [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988]]. Though they eventually lost to the Nets 4\u20132 (preventing a [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry|Celtics\u2013Lakers NBA Finals]]), they did create the biggest 4th quarter playoff comeback in Game 3, winning 94\u201390 after trailing by as much as 21 prior to the fourth quarter. (This record was later broken by the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who came back from 24 in the fourth quarter against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in [[2012 NBA playoffs|2012]]).\n\nThe [[Detroit Pistons]] won their first playoff series since 1991. They would lose in the Eastern Conference Semifinals to the Celtics in five games.\n\nThe playoffs also marked the last appearance of the [[Charlotte Hornets]] in the playoffs until [[2010 NBA playoffs|2010]]. The Hornets moved the next year to [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans]], while an expansion team, formerly the Bobcats, was formed in 2004. The Hornets were renamed the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name in 2014. The Hornets also reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Charlotte teams. The [[Charlotte Coliseum]] played host to its final playoff game on May 12.\n\nThe playoffs marked the last time [[NBA on NBC|NBC]] and [[NBA on TBS|TBS]] aired NBA games as regular TV partners of the league. The last TBS-aired game under its various contracts was Game 5 of the Lakers-Spurs series, while Game 4 of the NBA Finals marked the last telecast on NBC. TBS and NBC were replaced with [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]] and [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] the following season, since both channels are owned by the [[Walt Disney Company]]. TBS has aired some NBA basketball in the ensuing years due to conflicts on sister network [[NBA on TNT|TNT]].\n\nFor the first time in his career, [[Michael Jordan]] missed the playoffs. [[Pat Riley]] also missed the playoffs for the first time in his coaching career.\n\nThe total number of playoff games was 70, including the [[NBA Finals]].\n\n==Bracket==\n{{2002 NBA Playoffs}}\n\n==Playoff qualifying==\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Best record in NBA====\nThe [[Sacramento Kings]] clinched the best record in the NBA, and earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.\n====Clinched a playoff berth====\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\n#[[Sacramento Kings]] (61-21, clinched Pacific division)\n#[[San Antonio Spurs]] (58-24, clinched Midwest division)\n#[[Los Angeles Lakers]] (58-24)\n#[[Dallas Mavericks]] (57-25)\n#[[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (50-32)\n#[[Portland Trail Blazers]] (49-33)\n#[[Seattle SuperSonics]] (45-37)\n#[[Utah Jazz]] (44-38)\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====Best record in conference====\nNew Jersey Nets\n\n====Clinched a playoff berth====\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\n#[[New Jersey Nets]] (52-30, clinched Atlantic division)\n#[[Detroit Pistons]] (50-32, clinched Central division)\n#[[Boston Celtics]] (49-33)\n#[[Charlotte Hornets]] (44-38)\n#[[Orlando Magic]] (44-38)\n#[[Philadelphia 76ers]] (43-39)\n#[[Toronto Raptors]] (42-40)\n#[[Indiana Pacers]] (42-40)\n\n==Western Conference==\nChampion: '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]'''\n\n===First Round===\n\n====(1) [[Sacramento Kings]] vs. (8) [[Utah Jazz]]====\n{{Basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=April 20 |time=3:00 PM |place=[[Sleep Train Arena|ARCO Arena]], [[Sacramento, California]] |TV=[[NBA on NBC|NBC]]\n|team1=[[Utah Jazz]] |score1=86\n|team2='''[[Sacramento Kings]]''' |score2='''89'''\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204200SAC.html Boxscore]\n|Q1=20\u2013'''25''' |Q2='''27'''\u201321 |Q3=17\u2013'''25''' |Q4='''22'''\u201318\n|points1=[[Karl Malone]] 25 |points2=[[Chris Webber]] 24\n|rebounds1=[[Donyell Marshall]] 10 |rebounds2=[[Chris Webber]] 12\n|assist1=[[John Stockton]] 12 |assist2=[[Chris Webber]] 7\n|attendance=17,317\n|referee=Bernie Fryer, Ron Garretson, Blane Reichelt\n|series=Sacramento leads series, 1\u20130\n}}\n{{Basketballbox |date=April 23 |time=10:30 PM |place=[[Sleep Train Arena|ARCO Arena]], [[Sacramento, California]] |TV=[[NBA on TBS|TBS]]\n|team1='''[[Utah Jazz]]''' |score1='''93'''\n|team2=[[Sacramento Kings]] |score2=86\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204230SAC.html Boxscore]\n|Q1='''15'''\u201314 |Q2='''29'''\u201315 |Q3=20\u2013'''23''' |Q4=29\u2013'''34'''\n|points1=[[Donyell Marshall]] 19 |points2=[[Vlade Divac]] 21\n|rebounds1=[[Karl Malone]] 12 |rebounds2=[[Chris Webber]] 9\n|assist1=[[John Stockton]] 12 |assist2=[[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]] 5\n|attendance=17,317\n|referee=Dick Bavetta, Mike Callahan, Monty McCutchen\n|series=Series tied, 1\u20131\n}}\n{{Basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=April 27 |time=3:00 PM |place=[[Vivint Smart Home Arena|Delta Center]], [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] |TV=[[NBA on NBC|NBC]]\n|team1='''[[Sacramento Kings]]''' |score1='''90'''\n|team2=[[Utah Jazz]] |score2=87\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204270UTA.html Boxscore]\n|Q1='''32'''\u201321 |Q2=14\u2013'''24''' |Q3='''23'''\u201321 |Q4=21\u201321\n|points1=[[Mike Bibby]] 26 |points2=[[Karl Malone]] 23\n|rebounds1=[[Chris Webber]] 13 |rebounds2=[[Karl Malone|Malone]], [[Bryon Russell|Russell]] 6 each\n|assist1=[[Mike Bibby]] 5 |assist2=[[Karl Malone|Malone]], [[John Stockton|Stockton]] 7 each\n|attendance=19,911\n|referee=David Jones, Eddie F.

Kings]] vs. (3) [[Los Angeles Lakers]]====\n\nThe 2002 Western Conference finals is widely regarded as one of the best series in NBA playoff history, with the last four games coming down to the final seconds. Two games were decided on game winning shots and Game 7 was decided in overtime. However, the series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee [[Tim Donaghy]]'s attorney filed a court document alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy \"learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series.\" The Lakers won Game 6 106-102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales, \"top executives of the NBA sought to manipulate games using referees\". It also said that NBA officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players, and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game. Stern denied the accusations, calling Donaghy a \"singing, cooperating witness\".\n\nThe Lakers and Kings split the first two games in Sacramento. Los Angeles raced out to a 36-point first quarter in Game 1 behind 67% shooting and never trailed, paced by Kobe Bryant's 30 point effort and 26 points from [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. [[Chris Webber]] had 28 points and 14 rebounds, but the other Kings combined shot under 40 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220518023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 18, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Sacramento rebounded to win Game 2, paced behind Webber (21 points, 13 rebounds) and Mike Bibby (20 points). O'Neal had 35 points and 13 rebounds, but struggled with foul trouble; Bryant shot 9-for-21 from the field and was suffering from food poisoning which he contracted from a meal at the team hotel, and some felt it was done deliberately by the hotel staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/2002-western-conference-oral-history-los-angeles-lakers-sacramento-kings/|title=All the Kings\u2019 Men|first=Jonathan|last=Abrams|date=7 May 2014|website=grantland.com}}</ref> The loss snapped the NBA record 12-game playoff road winning streak for the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220520023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 20, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Kings went to Staples Center and dominated Game 3 to regain home-court advantage, leading by as many as 27 and never trailing. They were again paced by Webber and Bibby, who combined for 50 points, and got solid contributions from [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]] (17 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 steals) and [[Vlade Divac]] (11 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks). Other than a brief 3-point barrage in the 4th quarter by the Lakers to cut the lead to 12, there was not much help provided for O'Neal, who had 20 points and 19 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220524013|title=Kings vs. Lakers - Game Recap - May 24, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Game 4, Sacramento again got out to a fast start with a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final possession with a chance to tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry behind the 3 point line, who hit the 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two more crucial 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant had 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220526013|title=Kings vs. Lakers - Game Recap - May 26, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nAs the series shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed almost the entire fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92\u201391 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led Los Angeles with 30 points, but missed a potential game winner at the buzzer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020528/LALSAC/recap.html|title=NBA.com: Kings One Away from a Crowning Achievement|author=|date=|website=www.nba.com}}</ref> O'Neal had 28 points, but did not take a shot in the 4th quarter and fouled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220528023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 28, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nGame 6 is considered to be one of the most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The Lakers, led by O'Neal's 41 points and 17 rebounds, won 106-102, setting the stage for Game 7 in Sacramento. There are allegations that the game was affected by the referees in relationship to the [[2007 NBA betting scandal|Tim Donaghy scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401|title=2002 Lakers-Kings Game 6 at heart of Donaghy allegations|author=Sheridan, Chris|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-06-11|accessdate=2008-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120151/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401| archivedate= 11 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> The Lakers shot 40 free throws overall, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, and the Kings' big men were plagued with foul trouble (Divac, Webber, [[Scot Pollard]], and [[Lawrence Funderburke]] were called for 20 fouls, with Divac and Pollard both fouling out).

After O'Neal hit 1 of 2 free throws, Bibby was fouled by Bryant and made both free throws to force overtime. The Kings' offense stalled in the extra period, and the Lakers prevailed 112\u2013106. Sacramento was undone by poor free throw shooting (16\u201330 from the line), a horrid 2\u201320 from behind the arc, and a seeming unwillingness for anyone other than Bibby to take crucial shots down the stretch. O'Neal scored 35 and Bryant added 30 in the victory, as all five Lakers starters finished in double figures. Bibby finished with 29 points, and Webber finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists. Divac added 15 points and 10 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020602/LALSAC/recap.html|title=NBA.com: Lakers March On as Kings Can't Dethrone Dynasty|author=|date=|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2008-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009024519/http://www.nba.com/games/20020602/LALSAC/recap.html|archive-date=2008-10-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis would be the last Western Conference finals to be decided in seven games until [[2016 NBA Playoffs|2016]].\n\nAnnouncers: for NBC, [[Mike Breen]] announced Game 1, [[Marv Albert]] Games 3-7; [[Bill Walton]] & [[Steve Jones (basketball)|Steve Jones]] joined them as the analysts.

It was also the first time that professional sports teams from [[Detroit]] and [[Toronto]] met in a postseason series since the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] met in the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1993 Norris Division Semifinals]], but no two teams from the two cities have met in a postseason series since.  The Detroit Pistons were coming off a year where they had lost 50 games. The Raptors had lost their star forward, Vince Carter, for the remainder of the season. As a result, the Raptors lost 13 straight games without him. Although they looked down and out of playoff contention, the Raptors went on a surge, winning 12 of their last 14 games, locking up the 7th seed. The home team won each game of the series, with the Pistons winning the decisive Game 5 by 3 points. Raptors' Guard, Chris Childs, attempted to draw a foul on a three-point shot, instead of passing it to an open Dell Curry. In the post game interview, Childs stated that he thought the team was down by four points, not three. Detroit advanced to face the Boston Celtics in the second round. \n|-\n!Game\n!Date\n!Visitor\n!Score\n!Home\n!Score\n!Record\n(DET-TOR)\n!Venue\n!TV Time\n!Recap\n|-\n|align = center|1\n|April 21\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|63\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|85\n|align = center|1-0\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TNT 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020421/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|2\n|April 24\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|91\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|96\n|align = center|2-0\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TNT 7:00 PM\n|align= center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020424/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|3\n|April 27\n|align = center|Detroit\n|align = center|84\n|align = center|'''Toronto'''\n|align = center|94\n|align = center|2-1\n|align = center|[[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]]\n|align = center|TNT 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020427/DETTOR/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|4\n|April 29\n|align = center|Detroit\n|align = center|83\n|align = center|'''Toronto'''\n|align = center|89\n|align = center|2-2\n|align = center|[[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]]\n|align = center|TNT 7:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020429/DETTOR/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|5\n|May 2\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|82\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|85\n|align = center|3-2\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TBS 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[https://web.archive.org/web/20160805073059/http://www.nba.com/games/20020502/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" | '''Detroit''' wins series 3&ndash;2  <br/>\n|}\n\nGame 5 is [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]'s final NBA game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Detroit won 3\u20131 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = November 20, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|11200|id=TOR}}\n| team1 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score1 = '''88'''\n| team2 = [[Toronto Raptors]] |score2 = 84\n| place = [[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = January 15, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|01150|id=DET}}\n| team1 = '''[[Toronto Raptors]]''' | score1 = '''92'''\n| team2 = [[Detroit Pistons]] |score2 = 90\n| place = [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = February 18, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|02180|id=DET}}\n| team1 = [[Toronto Raptors]] | score1 = 76\n| team2 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score2 = '''89'''\n| place = [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = February 22, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|02220|id=TOR}}\n| team1 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score1 = '''80'''\n| team2 = [[Toronto Raptors]] |score2 = 72\n| place = [[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pistons and the Raptors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/rivals.cgi?request=1&team_id=DET&opp_id=TOR&is_playoffs=Y|title=Team Rivalry Finder \u2014 Detroit Pistons versus Toronto Raptors (Playoffs)|publisher=basketball-reference.com|date=|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====(3) [[Boston Celtics]] vs. (6) [[Philadelphia 76ers]]====\n\nThis series marked the return of the Celtics to the playoffs for the first time in seven years, and they faced the reigning Eastern Conference champion in the first round. The first two games were played in Boston, where the Celtics won both games resoundingly. The 76ers fought back, however, and with [[Allen Iverson]] scoring 42 points the 76ers won Game 3 and stayed alive. In Game 4, Iverson was slowed down, scoring 26 points on just 9-of-26 shooting, and [[Antoine Walker]] stepped up for the Celtics, scoring 25. But Iverson's play at the end making a layup, scoring off an [[Eric Snow]] steal, and hitting some free throws after Walker drilled a three sealed the victory for the 76ers. This set the stage for a Game 5 in Boston to decide the series. The Celtics had control on this game throughout, but the 76ers kept within striking distance into the 4th quarter. But Boston went on an amazing streak of three-pointers, hitting an NBA playoff record nine of them in the 4th quarter and 19 in the game. [[Paul Pierce]] led the way with 46, on 8-10 shooting from downtown, and Boston won in a huge blowout, sending them to the conference semifinals to face second-seed Detroit.\n{|

The Nets won games five and six to advance to the team's first of two consecutive NBA Finals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Game\n!Date\n!Visitor\n!Score\n!Home\n!Score\n!Record\n(NJN-BOS)\n!Venue\n!TV Time\n!Recap\n|-align = center\n|1\n|May 19\n|Boston \n|97\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|104\n|1-0\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020519/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|2\n|May 21\n|'''Boston'''\n|93\n|New Jersey\n|86\n|1-1\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|TNT 8:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020521/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|3\n|May 25\n|New Jersey\n|90\n|'''Boston'''\n|94\n|1-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020525/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|4\n|May 27\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|94\n|Boston\n|92\n|2-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020527/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|5\n|May 29\n|Boston\n|92\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|103\n|3-2\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|NBC 9:00 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020529/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center \n|6\n|May 31\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|96\n|Boston\n|88\n|4-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 7:00 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020531/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" | '''New Jersey''' wins Eastern Conference Championship series 4&ndash;2\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Boston won 3\u20131 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = October 31, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|10310|id=BOS}}\n| team1 = '''[[New Jersey Nets]]''' |score1 = '''95'''\n| team2 = [[Boston Celtics]] | score2 = 92\n| place = [[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = December 1, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|12010|id=NJN}}\n| team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score1 = '''105''' \n| team2 = [[New Jersey Nets]] | score2 = 98 |overtime=OT\n| place = [[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = March 13, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|03130|id=BOS}}\n| team1 = [[New Jersey Nets]] |score1 = 89\n| team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score2 = '''97'''\n| place = [[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = April 7, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|04070|id=NJN}}\n| team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score1 = '''102''' \n| team2 = [[New Jersey Nets]] | score2 = 90\n| place = [[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Nets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/rivals.cgi?request=1&team_id=BOS&opp_id=NJN&is_playoffs=Y|title=Team Rivalry Finder \u2014 Boston Celtics versus Brooklyn Nets (Playoffs)|publisher=basketball-reference.com|date=|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==NBA Finals==\n\n{{main article|2002 NBA Finals}}\n\n===(W3) [[Los Angeles Lakers]] vs. (E1) [[New Jersey Nets]]===\n'''Last Playoff Meeting''': This is the first meeting between the Lakers and Nets.\n\nIn Game 1, the Nets stayed within striking distance, but [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s 36 points and 16 rebounds led the Lakers to victory.

This was the final postseason that held a best-of-5 first-round series; the [[2003 NBA Playoffs]] saw those series expand to a best-of-7 format. The tournament concluded with the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] defeating the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[New Jersey Nets]] 4 games to 0. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] for the third straight year.\n\nThis year marked the return of playoff success for the [[Boston Celtics]], who had last made the playoffs in [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995]], won their last playoff series in 1992 and made their last Eastern Conference Finals appearance in [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988]]. Though they eventually lost to the Nets 4\u20132 (preventing a [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry|Celtics\u2013Lakers NBA Finals]]), they did create the biggest 4th quarter playoff comeback in Game 3, winning 94\u201390 after trailing by as much as 21 prior to the fourth quarter. (This record was later broken by the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who came back from 24 in the fourth quarter against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in [[2012 NBA playoffs|2012]]).\n\nThe [[Detroit Pistons]] won their first playoff series since 1991. They would lose in the Eastern Conference Semifinals to the Celtics in five games.\n\nThe playoffs also marked the last appearance of the [[Charlotte Hornets]] in the playoffs until [[2010 NBA playoffs|2010]]. The Hornets moved the next year to [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans]], while an expansion team, formerly the Bobcats, was formed in 2004. The Hornets were renamed the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name in 2014. The Hornets also reclaimed the history and records of the 1988\u20132002 Charlotte teams. The [[Charlotte Coliseum]] played host to its final playoff game on May 12.\n\nThe playoffs marked the last time [[NBA on NBC|NBC]] and [[NBA on TBS|TBS]] aired NBA games as regular TV partners of the league. The last TBS-aired game under its various contracts was Game 5 of the Lakers-Spurs series, while Game 4 of the NBA Finals marked the last telecast on NBC. TBS and NBC were replaced with [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]] and [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] the following season, since both channels are owned by the [[Walt Disney Company]]. TBS has aired some NBA basketball in the ensuing years due to conflicts on sister network [[NBA on TNT|TNT]].\n\nFor the first time in his career, [[Michael Jordan]] missed the playoffs. [[Pat Riley]] also missed the playoffs for the first time in his coaching career.\n\nThe total number of playoff games was 70, including the [[NBA Finals]].\n\n==Bracket==\n{{2002 NBA Playoffs}}\n\n==Playoff qualifying==\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Best record in NBA====\nThe [[Sacramento Kings]] clinched the best record in the NBA, and earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.\n====Clinched a playoff berth====\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\n#[[Sacramento Kings]] (61-21, clinched Pacific division)\n#[[San Antonio Spurs]] (58-24, clinched Midwest division)\n#[[Los Angeles Lakers]] (58-24)\n#[[Dallas Mavericks]] (57-25)\n#[[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (50-32)\n#[[Portland Trail Blazers]] (49-33)\n#[[Seattle SuperSonics]] (45-37)\n#[[Utah Jazz]] (44-38)\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====Best record in conference====\nNew Jersey Nets\n\n====Clinched a playoff berth====\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\n#[[New Jersey Nets]] (52-30, clinched Atlantic division)\n#[[Detroit Pistons]] (50-32, clinched Central division)\n#[[Boston Celtics]] (49-33)\n#[[Charlotte Hornets]] (44-38)\n#[[Orlando Magic]] (44-38)\n#[[Philadelphia 76ers]] (43-39)\n#[[Toronto Raptors]] (42-40)\n#[[Indiana Pacers]] (42-40)\n\n==Western Conference==\nChampion: '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]'''\n\n===First Round===\n\n====(1) [[Sacramento Kings]] vs. (8) [[Utah Jazz]]====\n{{Basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=April 20 |time=3:00 PM |place=[[Sleep Train Arena|ARCO Arena]], [[Sacramento, California]] |TV=[[NBA on NBC|NBC]]\n|team1=[[Utah Jazz]] |score1=86\n|team2='''[[Sacramento Kings]]''' |score2='''89'''\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204200SAC.html Boxscore]\n|Q1=20\u2013'''25''' |Q2='''27'''\u201321 |Q3=17\u2013'''25''' |Q4='''22'''\u201318\n|points1=[[Karl Malone]] 25 |points2=[[Chris Webber]] 24\n|rebounds1=[[Donyell Marshall]] 10 |rebounds2=[[Chris Webber]] 12\n|assist1=[[John Stockton]] 12 |assist2=[[Chris Webber]] 7\n|attendance=17,317\n|referee=Bernie Fryer, Ron Garretson, Blane Reichelt\n|series=Sacramento leads series, 1\u20130\n}}\n{{Basketballbox |date=April 23 |time=10:30 PM |place=[[Sleep Train Arena|ARCO Arena]], [[Sacramento, California]] |TV=[[NBA on TBS|TBS]]\n|team1='''[[Utah Jazz]]''' |score1='''93'''\n|team2=[[Sacramento Kings]] |score2=86\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204230SAC.html Boxscore]\n|Q1='''15'''\u201314 |Q2='''29'''\u201315 |Q3=20\u2013'''23''' |Q4=29\u2013'''34'''\n|points1=[[Donyell Marshall]] 19 |points2=[[Vlade Divac]] 21\n|rebounds1=[[Karl Malone]] 12 |rebounds2=[[Chris Webber]] 9\n|assist1=[[John Stockton]] 12 |assist2=[[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]] 5\n|attendance=17,317\n|referee=Dick Bavetta, Mike Callahan, Monty McCutchen\n|series=Series tied, 1\u20131\n}}\n{{Basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=April 27 |time=3:00 PM |place=[[Vivint Smart Home Arena|Delta Center]], [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] |TV=[[NBA on NBC|NBC]]\n|team1='''[[Sacramento Kings]]''' |score1='''90'''\n|team2=[[Utah Jazz]] |score2=87\n|report=[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200204270UTA.html Boxscore]\n|Q1='''32'''\u201321 |Q2=14\u2013'''24''' |Q3='''23'''\u201321 |Q4=21\u201321\n|points1=[[Mike Bibby]] 26 |points2=[[Karl Malone]] 23\n|rebounds1=[[Chris Webber]] 13 |rebounds2=[[Karl Malone|Malone]], [[Bryon Russell|Russell]] 6 each\n|assist1=[[Mike Bibby]] 5 |assist2=[[Karl Malone|Malone]], [[John Stockton|Stockton]] 7 each\n|attendance=19,911\n|referee=David Jones, Eddie F.

Kings]] vs. (3) [[Los Angeles Lakers]]====\n\nThe 2002 Western Conference finals is widely regarded as one of the best series in NBA playoff history, with the last four games coming down to the final seconds. Two games were decided on game winning shots and Game 7 was decided in overtime. However, the series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee [[Tim Donaghy]]'s attorney filed a court document alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy \"learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series.\" The Lakers won Game 6 106-102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales, \"top executives of the NBA sought to manipulate games using referees\". It also said that NBA officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players, and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game. Stern denied the accusations, calling Donaghy a \"singing, cooperating witness\".\n\nThe Lakers and Kings split the first two games in Sacramento. Los Angeles raced out to a 36-point first quarter in Game 1 behind 67% shooting and never trailed, paced by Kobe Bryant's 30 point effort and 26 points from [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. [[Chris Webber]] had 28 points and 14 rebounds, but the other Kings combined shot under 40 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220518023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 18, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Sacramento rebounded to win Game 2, paced behind Webber (21 points, 13 rebounds) and Mike Bibby (20 points). O'Neal had 35 points and 13 rebounds, but struggled with foul trouble; Bryant shot 9-for-21 from the field and was suffering from food poisoning which he contracted from a meal at the team hotel, and some felt it was done deliberately by the hotel staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/2002-western-conference-oral-history-los-angeles-lakers-sacramento-kings/|title=All the Kings\u2019 Men|first=Jonathan|last=Abrams|date=7 May 2014|website=grantland.com}}</ref> The loss snapped the NBA record 12-game playoff road winning streak for the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220520023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 20, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Kings went to Staples Center and dominated Game 3 to regain home-court advantage, leading by as many as 27 and never trailing. They were again paced by Webber and Bibby, who combined for 50 points, and got solid contributions from [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]] (17 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 steals) and [[Vlade Divac]] (11 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks). Other than a brief 3-point barrage in the 4th quarter by the Lakers to cut the lead to 12, there was not much help provided for O'Neal, who had 20 points and 19 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220524013|title=Kings vs. Lakers - Game Recap - May 24, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Game 4, Sacramento again got out to a fast start with a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final possession with a chance to tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry behind the 3 point line, who hit the 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two more crucial 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant had 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220526013|title=Kings vs. Lakers - Game Recap - May 26, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nAs the series shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed almost the entire fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92\u201391 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led L.A. with 30 points, but missed a potential game winner at the buzzer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020528/LALSAC/recap.html|title=NBA.com: Kings One Away from a Crowning Achievement|author=|date=|website=www.nba.com}}</ref> O'Neal had 28 points, but did not take a shot in the 4th quarter and fouled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220528023|title=Lakers vs. Kings - Game Recap - May 28, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nGame 6 is considered to be one of the most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The Lakers, led by O'Neal's 41 points and 17 rebounds, won 106-102, setting the stage for Game 7 in Sacramento. There are allegations that the game was affected by the referees in relationship to the [[2007 NBA betting scandal|Tim Donaghy scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401|title=2002 Lakers-Kings Game 6 at heart of Donaghy allegations|author=Sheridan, Chris|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-06-11|accessdate=2008-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120151/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401| archivedate= 11 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> The Lakers shot 40 free throws overall, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, and the Kings' big men were plagued with foul trouble (Divac, Webber, [[Scot Pollard]], and [[Lawrence Funderburke]] were called for 20 fouls, with Divac and Pollard both fouling out). Webber nearly had a triple double (26 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists), Bibby scored 23, and Divac had 12 points and 12 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220531013|title=Kings vs. Lakers - Game Recap - May 31, 2002 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' sports columnist [[Michael Wilbon]] responded to the calls in Game 6: \"I wrote down in my notebook six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship.\" For example, Wilbon pointed out that [[Kobe Bryant]] did not get a foul called on him after elbowing [[Mike Bibby]] in front of an official.<ref name=\"Wilbon 2002\">{{cite news|last=Wilbon|first=Michael|title=Talk About Foul!

In the final ten seconds with Los Angeles up 99\u201398, Peja Stojakovi\u0107 air-balled a wide open 3, and O'Neal was fouled on the rebound. After O'Neal hit 1 of 2 free throws, Bibby was fouled by Bryant and made both free throws to force overtime. The Kings' offense stalled in the extra period, and the Lakers prevailed 112\u2013106. Sacramento was undone by poor free throw shooting (16-30 from the line), a horrid 2\u201320 from behind the arc, and a seeming unwillingness for anyone other than Bibby to take crucial shots down the stretch. O'Neal scored 35 and Bryant added 30 in the victory, as all five Lakers starters finished in double figures. Bibby finished with 29 points, and Webber finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists. Divac added 15 points and 10 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020602/LALSAC/recap.html|title=NBA.com: Lakers March On as Kings Can't Dethrone Dynasty|author=|date=|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2008-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009024519/http://www.nba.com/games/20020602/LALSAC/recap.html|archive-date=2008-10-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis would be the last Western Conference finals to be decided in seven games until [[2016 NBA Playoffs|2016]].\n\nAnnouncers: for NBC, [[Mike Breen]] announced Game 1, [[Marv Albert]] Games 3-7; [[Bill Walton]] & [[Steve Jones (basketball)|Steve Jones]] joined them as the analysts.

It was also the first time that professional sports teams from [[Detroit]] and [[Toronto]] met in a postseason series since the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] met in the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1993 Norris Division Semifinals]], but no two teams from the two cities have met in a postseason series since.  The Detroit Pistons were coming off a year where they had lost 50 games. The Raptors had lost their star forward, Vince Carter, for the remainder of the season. As a result, the Raptors lost 13 straight games without him. Although they looked down and out of playoff contention, the Raptors went on a surge, winning 12 of their last 14 games, locking up the 7th seed. The home team won each game of the series, with the Pistons winning the decisive Game 5 by 3 points. Raptors' Guard, Chris Childs, attempted to draw a foul on a three-point shot, instead of passing it to an open Dell Curry. In the post game interview, Childs stated that he thought the team was down by four points, not three. Detroit advanced to face the Boston Celtics in the second round. \n|-\n!Game\n!Date\n!Visitor\n!Score\n!Home\n!Score\n!Record\n(DET-TOR)\n!Venue\n!TV Time\n!Recap\n|-\n|align = center|1\n|April 21\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|63\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|85\n|align = center|1-0\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TNT 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020421/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|2\n|April 24\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|91\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|96\n|align = center|2-0\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TNT 7:00 PM\n|align= center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020424/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|3\n|April 27\n|align = center|Detroit\n|align = center|84\n|align = center|'''Toronto'''\n|align = center|94\n|align = center|2-1\n|align = center|[[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]]\n|align = center|TNT 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020427/DETTOR/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|4\n|April 29\n|align = center|Detroit\n|align = center|83\n|align = center|'''Toronto'''\n|align = center|89\n|align = center|2-2\n|align = center|[[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]]\n|align = center|TNT 7:30 PM\n|align = center|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020429/DETTOR/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n|align = center|5\n|May 2\n|align = center|Toronto\n|align = center|82\n|align = center|'''Detroit'''\n|align = center|85\n|align = center|3-2\n|align = center|[[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]]\n|align = center|TBS 8:30 PM\n|align = center|[https://web.archive.org/web/20160805073059/http://www.nba.com/games/20020502/TORDET/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" | '''Detroit''' wins series 3&ndash;2  <br/>\n|}\n\nGame 5 is [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]'s final NBA game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Detroit won 3\u20131 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = November 20, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|11200|id=TOR}}\n| team1 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score1 = '''88'''\n| team2 = [[Toronto Raptors]] |score2 = 84\n| place = [[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = January 15, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|01150|id=DET}}\n| team1 = '''[[Toronto Raptors]]''' | score1 = '''92'''\n| team2 = [[Detroit Pistons]] |score2 = 90\n| place = [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = February 18, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|02180|id=DET}}\n| team1 = [[Toronto Raptors]] | score1 = 76\n| team2 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score2 = '''89'''\n| place = [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = February 22, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|02220|id=TOR}}\n| team1 = '''[[Detroit Pistons]]''' |score1 = '''80'''\n| team2 = [[Toronto Raptors]] |score2 = 72\n| place = [[Air Canada Centre]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pistons and the Raptors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/rivals.cgi?request=1&team_id=DET&opp_id=TOR&is_playoffs=Y|title=Team Rivalry Finder \u2014 Detroit Pistons versus Toronto Raptors (Playoffs)|publisher=basketball-reference.com|date=|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====(3) [[Boston Celtics]] vs. (6) [[Philadelphia 76ers]]====\n\nThis series marked the return of the Celtics to the playoffs for the first time in seven years, and they faced the reigning Eastern Conference champion in the first round. The first two games were played in Boston, where the Celtics won both games resoundingly. The 76ers fought back, however, and with [[Allen Iverson]] scoring 42 points the 76ers won Game 3 and stayed alive. In Game 4, Iverson was slowed down, scoring 26 points on just 9-of-26 shooting, and [[Antoine Walker]] stepped up for the Celtics, scoring 25. But Iverson's play at the end making a layup, scoring off an [[Eric Snow]] steal, and hitting some free throws after Walker drilled a three sealed the victory for the 76ers. This set the stage for a Game 5 in Boston to decide the series. The Celtics had control on this game throughout, but the 76ers kept within striking distance into the 4th quarter. But Boston went on an amazing streak of three-pointers, hitting an NBA playoff record nine of them in the 4th quarter and 19 in the game. [[Paul Pierce]] led the way with 46, on 8-10 shooting from downtown, and Boston won in a huge blowout, sending them to the conference semifinals to face second-seed Detroit.\n{|

The Nets won games five and six to advance to the team's first of two consecutive NBA Finals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Game\n!Date\n!Visitor\n!Score\n!Home\n!Score\n!Record\n(NJN-BOS)\n!Venue\n!TV Time\n!Recap\n|-align = center\n|1\n|May 19\n|Boston \n|97\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|104\n|1-0\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020519/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|2\n|May 21\n|'''Boston'''\n|93\n|New Jersey\n|86\n|1-1\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|TNT 8:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020521/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|3\n|May 25\n|New Jersey\n|90\n|'''Boston'''\n|94\n|1-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020525/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|4\n|May 27\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|94\n|Boston\n|92\n|2-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 5:30 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020527/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center\n|5\n|May 29\n|Boston\n|92\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|103\n|3-2\n|[[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|New Jersey]]\n|NBC 9:00 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020529/BOSNJN/recap.html Recap]\n|-align = center \n|6\n|May 31\n|'''New Jersey'''\n|96\n|Boston\n|88\n|4-2\n|[[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n|NBC 7:00 PM\n|[http://www.nba.com/games/20020531/NJNBOS/recap.html Recap]\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" | '''New Jersey''' wins Eastern Conference Championship series 4&ndash;2\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Boston won 3\u20131 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = October 31, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|10310|id=BOS}}\n| team1 = '''[[New Jersey Nets]]''' |score1 = '''95'''\n| team2 = [[Boston Celtics]] | score2 = 92\n| place = [[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = December 1, 2001\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2001|12010|id=NJN}}\n| team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score1 = '''105''' \n| team2 = [[New Jersey Nets]] | score2 = 98 |overtime=OT\n| place = [[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = March 13, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|03130|id=BOS}}\n| team1 = [[New Jersey Nets]] |score1 = 89\n| team2 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score2 = '''97'''\n| place = [[FleetCenter (Boston)|FleetCenter]], [[Boston]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = April 7, 2002\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|2002|04070|id=NJN}}\n| team1 = '''[[Boston Celtics]]''' | score1 = '''102''' \n| team2 = [[New Jersey Nets]] | score2 = 90\n| place = [[Continental Airlines Arena]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Nets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/rivals.cgi?request=1&team_id=BOS&opp_id=NJN&is_playoffs=Y|title=Team Rivalry Finder \u2014 Boston Celtics versus Brooklyn Nets (Playoffs)|publisher=basketball-reference.com|date=|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==NBA Finals==\n\n{{main article|2002 NBA Finals}}\n\n===(W3) [[Los Angeles Lakers]] vs. (E1) [[New Jersey Nets]]===\n'''Last Playoff Meeting''': This is the first meeting between the Lakers and Nets.\n\nIn Game 1, the Nets stayed within striking distance, but [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s 36 points and 16 rebounds led the Lakers to victory.

The company was originally headquartered on [[Bowling Green Offices Building|11 Broadway]] and at 43 ''-'' 5 ''-'' 7 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)]], both in [[Lower Manhattan]].\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920.

C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the [[boiler|steam boiler]] business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, MI]]. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in [[Chattanooga, TN]] to augment its manufacturing capabilities. \n\nIn the 1970s C-E acquired the first 'Recycling Wire Granulation System' from a young entrepreneur/inventor and metallurgical engineer by the name of Charles Victor Paul Balo. The recycling wire granulation system was a large piece of machinery that took scrap wire from the phone companies and electric companies and extracted the alloy from the plastic or rubber coating quickly and automatically, separating the dross. The stripped alloy would go into a containment device and the dross would go into another. Both to be recycled, therefore avoiding the rapidly overflowing landfills.\n\n===Merger with the Superheater Company===\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of [[superheater|superheated steam]] in [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].\n \nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company. Following consolidation the corporation was called Combustion Engineering-Superheater Inc.<ref>''Merger of Combustion Engineering Co. With Superheater Approved'', Wall Street Journal, December 23, 1948, pg. 5.</ref> In September 1950 the firm announced plans to build a large high-pressure generating unit for [[Virginia Electric & Power Company]] in [[Chester, Virginia]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Build New Generator For Virginia Electric'', Wall Street Journal, September 21, 1950, pg. 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the name Superheater was eliminated and the company took the more familiar name - Combustion Engineering, Inc. At this time, C-E primarily designed and built [[boiler|boiler assemblies]] for [[Power station|conventional power plants]]; those powered by [[coal]] and [[oil]].\n\nIn the mid-1950s, C-E also expanded its operations into oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and [[petrochemical]]s with the acquisition of the Lummus Company located in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]].  Lummus also supplied small industrial steam supply systems for oil field enhanced recovery.\n\nC-E was one of the major suppliers of [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]] for [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[steam turbine|steam-powered]] warships, including [[Liberty ship]]s during World War II. Amongst many other warships, all of the 46 {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}}s built during the 1960s and 1970s were equipped with a {{convert|1200|psi|lk=in|adj=on}} C-E power plant.\n\nC-E also was a leader in the development of large coal utility steam supply systems which were used worldwide. C-E pioneered the tangential firing process used in modern large pulverized coal utility boilers. C-E maintained a large coal burning test unit at the Windsor, Connecticut site which allowed the Power Systems Group to test changes to boiler air-flow and other critical boiler design factors.\n\n=== Growth of Nuclear Steam Supply Systems ===\n\nC-E's [[nuclear power]] activity began in 1955 under Arthur Santry Jr. The history of the C-E Windsor, Connecticut campus dates to the early development of the [[nuclear submarine]]. From the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, Combustion Engineering, under federal government contract, produced nuclear fuel for the US Navy's \"[[Nuclear Navy]]\" nuclear submarines. Also located at the Windsor site was the prototype marine [[nuclear propulsion]] training facility known as [[S1C reactor|S1C]], which was designed and constructed by C-E adjacent to its main campus. The S1C prototype was operated by C-E for more than ten years as an [[R&D]] and Naval training facility. After expiration of C-E's contract, the S1C contract was subsequently awarded to [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]] (KAPL), who operated the unit until its decommissioning and dismantlement in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.neoconveyors.com/products/chain-converyors | title=chain conveyors manufacturer in India| author=neoconveyors| date=April 13,2020| publisher=[[Neo Conveyors]] }}{{date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, C-E began selling [[nuclear power]] steam supply systems.  The first commercial nuclear steam supply system was sold to [[Consumers Power Company]] of Michigan for the [[Palisades Nuclear Generating Station]], which is still in operation (though scheduled to shut down permanently in 2022). C-E competed aggressively with [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] in this domain.\n\nIn the late 1960s the company supplied nuclear reactor systems and fabricated [[uranium]] fuel for [[electric utility]] companies. A joint venture was announced in April 1968, involving the Combustion Engineering Company, [[Houston Natural Gas]], and Ranchers Exploration & Development Corporation. The three businesses combined to search for uranium on {{convert|250000|acre|km2}} in [[New Mexico]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Join 2 Other Firms In a Hunt for Uranium'', Wall Street Journal, April 5, 1968, pg. 22.</ref>\n\nC-E was generally credited with a superior design, evidenced by the fact that the [[megawatt]] yield of its [[nuclear reactor]]s was typically about 10% higher than that of comparable Westinghouse plants.  The basis for this increase in efficiency was a computer-based system called the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System (COLSS) for design, and the Core Protection Calculator (CPC) for real-time control room operation<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.657.5580&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>, which leveraged almost 300 in-core [[neutron detector]]s and a patented [[algorithm]] to allow higher [[Power-to-weight ratio|power densities]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Combustion also fabricated a number of the Westinghouse reactor vessels and steam generators at its Chattanooga manufacturing facility under contracts with the Westinghouse company.\n\nC-E maintained a sophisticated nuclear reactor operator training simulator at the Windsor facility for support for customers of its nuclear steam supply systems.\n\n=== Company Structure & Organization ===\n\nIn the 1960s, and continuing through 1988, C-E acquired a number of companies, many not directly related to the core utility steam supply business.  As a result, the company structure evolved so that it had five and later six major business groups or divisions.  C-E Power Systems comprised the original utility steam supply components, C-E Industrial Group, C-E Lummus & Engineering Services Group, C-E Refractories & Minerals Group, C-E Oil & Gas Group, and last C-E Instrumentation & Controls Group were formed to provide management focus as the company and its products base expanded.  The Power Systems Division included the original major manufacturing facilities at Chattanooga, St. Louis, Monongahela, Birmingham; and in Canada, Brantford, Cornwall, and Upper Canada Manufacturing.  A number of companies were acquired or developed and added to the division including, American Pole Structures, C-E Controls, the P.F. Avery Co., C-E Impel, C-E Maguire (Charles A. Maguire & Associates) and C-E Metals (primarily a specialty scrap metal operation in Chattanooga); and was basically divided into three major sub-groups: Fossil, Nuclear, and Services (which included field erection, aftermarket spare parts, and engineering services). The Industrial Group included C-E Industrial Boiler (part of the original base of CE in East Chicago, IN and Detroit & Saginaw, MI), C-E Bauer (Pulp & Paper Equipment), C-E Raymond (Crushing and Conveying Equipment), C-E Air Preheater (Ljungstr\u00f6m\u00ae technology), C-E Tyler Screening (Industrial Wire Screens), C-E Ehrsham (Conveyors & Grain Elevators). C-E Enterprise Manufacturing, C-E Tyler Elevator, CERREY, and other industrial supply companies.  The Oil & Gas Group included such companies as C-E Natco, C-E Grey Tool, Beaumont Well Works, C-E Vetco, OilField Engineering, C-E Houston Forging, etc.  The Refractories & Minerals Group included C-E Minerals, C-E Refractories, C-E Cast Industrial Products, C-E Building Products (C-E Aluminum Building Products, C-E Morgan, C-E Stanley Artex), Georgia Kaolin, Pryor-Giggey, C-E Transport, C-E Glass, C-E Hordis Bros. Glass, etc.  The Instrumentation & Controls group included C-E Taylor Instruments, C-E Resource Recovery Systems, C-E Process Analytics (acquired from Bendix), et al.  Each group had a separate headquarters and support staff which coordinated each group's companies actions with the C-E Corporate support functions of Administration, Information Systems, Insurance, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Personnel.\n\nC-E had a large presence in Canada, including fossil and nuclear steam supply manufacturing facilities.  A number of the Industrial Group companies had manufacturing facilities there as well, primarily located in the province of Ontario.  The Oil & Gas Group had operations in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.  C-E maintained offices as well as a number of manufacturing sites on a worldwide basis, including the UK, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Belgium, Mexico and France.  C-E's technology on a wide range of products was licensed worldwide.\n\n=== Leadership & Management ===\n\nFor much of the existence of the company, the Santry family controlled the management of C-E.  Joseph Santry was President of the company until 1963.  Arthur Santry, Jr., Joseph's nephew, was named President in 1963 and Chairman of the C-E Board of Directors in 1982 and held both titles until he resigned his post as President in 1984.  He remained as Chairman until 1988.  Charles Hugel was named President of C-E in 1984 and remained in that position until 1988 when he succeeded Mr. Santry as Chairman of the Board.  George Kimmel was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1988 and remained in that position until the sale of the company to ABB in 1990.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/nyregion/arthur-j-santry-jr-74-is-dead-headed-combustion-engineering.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bruce | last=Lambert | title=Arthur J.

(1942)]]\n\n===Founding===\n\nCombustion Engineering was organized in 1912 through the merger of the Grieve Grate Company and the American Stoker Company, two well-known manufacturers of fuel burning equipment. The company was originally headquartered on [[Bowling Green Offices Building|11 Broadway]] and at 43 ''-'' 5 ''-'' 7 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)]], both in [[Lower Manhattan]].\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920. In May of the same year the firm began construction of an eight-story office building on the same site.<ref>''Alliance Realty Makes $3,000,000 Lease'', [[Wall Street Journal]], April 20, 1920, pg. 10.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, C-E's signature boiler equipment was the English designed Type-E [[Boiler#Stoker Fired Boilers|stoker]]. C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the [[boiler|steam boiler]] business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, MI]]. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in [[Chattanooga, TN]] to augment its manufacturing capabilities. \n\nIn the 1970s C-E acquired the first 'Recycling Wire Granulation System' from a young entrepreneur/inventor and metallurgical engineer by the name of Charles Victor Paul Balo. The recycling wire granulation system was a large piece of machinery that took scrap wire from the phone companies and electric companies and extracted the alloy from the plastic or rubber coating quickly and automatically, separating the dross. The stripped alloy would go into a containment device and the dross would go into another. Both to be recycled, therefore avoiding the rapidly overflowing landfills.\n\n===Merger with the Superheater Company===\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of [[superheater|superheated steam]] in [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].\n \nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

Lamar]] visited the area during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital, then in [[Houston]], be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] (near the present-day [[Congress Avenue Bridge]]). In 1839, the site was chosen to replace [[Houston]] as the capital of the [[Republic of Texas]] and was incorporated under the name \"Waterloo\". Shortly afterward, the name was changed to Austin in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]], the \"Father of Texas\" and the republic's first secretary of state. The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |title=History Lesson |accessdate=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau}}</ref> After a severe lull in economic growth from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Austin resumed its steady development.\n\nIn 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for [[Stephen F.

Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].\n\n[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east\u2013west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.\nDespite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name=\"Toll Road Revenue\">{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B\u20131 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]]]]\nAustin's airport is [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.
