[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew.

Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first presented on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

He fathered ten children \u2013 four boys and six girls. As of 2018, five of his children reside in the United States and live in the [[Pacific Northwest]] near [[Seattle]], Washington. The other five reside in the capital of [[Ethiopia]], [[Addis Ababa]].\n\n===Early life===\n\nGibreab's parents separated when he was just nine months old. He was raised by his aunt, who lived in the same region. Gibreab received primary education in the traditional schools of the area, learning to read and write through the [[Christian Church|church]]. He became known for his fast learning skills in Ge\u2019ez /liturgical language and served as a [[Deacon]] at an early age. He studied under the tutelage of Aleka Teffera. Aleka Teffera had an affinity for music that he shared with his young student. Teffera had once been a high-ranking member of a musical group in [[Menelik II|Emperor Menelik's]] court in [[Addis Ababa]]. He taught young Gibreab many of the songs and lyrics in praise of [[Addis Ababa]], the capital city, which had been played at the emperor's palace at a special occasion which took place on Thursday, 17 November 1878 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]].\n\nGibreab made his first journey to [[Addis Ababa]] when he was a mere ten years old. Having graduated from the church school in his village, he went to the capital city to apply for a deaconship. He later described his first impressions: \u201cAs compared with the countryside, Arada (the current Piazza) was lovely, a paradise. Everything I saw was thrilling and attractive\u2026It might surprise you if I tell you that when I first saw the mounted statue of [[Menelik II|Menelik]], I almost ran away thinking that the horse would descend upon me and squash me like a fly! It was in stages that I got used to it!\"<ref>(From Ethiopian Herald, Vol. XLIII, Thursday 20 November 1986 (11 Hedar 1979) \"Oh! Addis Ababa, Oh Arad\" by Melese Telahoun)</ref>\n\nWhile in Addis Ababa, Gibreab stayed near [[St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa|St. George's Cathedral]], continuing to learn music (although in a way that was not, perhaps, traditional): He was begging for food, as was the custom for young students ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12e8\u1246\u120e \u1270\u121b\u122a'}}) at the time, when a waitress offered him a meal. As he was eating, he heard a traditional singer ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12a0\u12dd\u121b\u122a'}}) accompanied by a Krar, singing a beautiful song. He was so transfixed by the melody that the song become embedded in his mind (Telahoun).\n \nAfter two weeks in Addis Ababa, the young Gibreab returned to his village home of [[Gojjam]] to continue his studies there. He was forced to quit his education in 1929 EC, during the [[second Italo-Abyssinian War]] war of resistance against Italian Fascists. During the five-year occupation by Italy, Gibreab served with his uncle, Dagazmach Zalaka Dasta({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12f0\u1303\u12dd\u121b\u127d \u12d8\u1208\u1240 \u12f0\u1235\u1273'}}) in [[Gojjam]], in the Kola Dega Damot ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u1246\u120b \u12f0\u130b \u12f3\u121e\u1275'}}) region. He became a resistance fighter and tailor for the patriot ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12a0\u122d\u1260\u129b'}}), creating the coarse, wool, blanket-like garments ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12f0\u1260\u120e'}}) for the anti-fascist rebels and a fighter. Even in this situation his passion for music kept growing.\n\n===Kebur Zabagna (\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b) and Entertainment===\n\n[[File:KeburZabagnaCrew.jpg|thumb|Kebur Zabagna Crew \u2013 from the right Baheru Tadla and next to him Gibreab Teferi]]\n\nIn 1938 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]], Gibreab Teferi returned to [[Addis Ababa]] to find a city much changed from his previous visit 12 years prior. He told Melese Talahoun, the city had \"changed a lot; practically nothing was as it used to be. Everything was mixed-up.\" He had become a [[deacon]] in [[St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa|St. George's cathedral]] and was in the city looking for a job. He came upon an employment posting from the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]] ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}), looking for any person who could read and write. Gibreab could do both, so he applied. Through the long application and interview process, the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]]({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}) recruiters discovered that Gibreab was a talented poet. He was brought into the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]] ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}) as an official playwright and lyricist for the entertainment division.\n\nDuring his tenure with the [[Kebur Zabagna]], Gibreab wrote several plays, many as a source of education for the soldiers; his first play to be performed in the military was \"Don't forget your military duty\" (\u12c8\u1273\u12f0\u122d\u1290\u1275\u1215\u1295 \u12a0\u1275\u122d\u1233), which encourages the soldiers to be clean, honorable, and presentable. Years before the [[Kebur Zabagna]] created a theatrical department in 1949, Gibreab's plays were performed by the men; just like Shakespearean actors, some men wore dresses and played the role of women. Gibreab also wrote many lyrics for the Kebur Zabagna band and most of his lyrics were performed by the famous [[kebur Zabagna]] band which includes the Famous [[Tilahun Gessesse]], Tefera Kasa, [[Bizunesh Bekele]], and many more. His work lives on, because, even today, those same lyrics are performed by the famous Kebur Zabagna artists and are appreciated and enjoyed by many Ethiopians. \n[[File:Gibreab Teferi's resignation letter.jpg|thumb|Resignation Letter From Kebur Zabagna]]\n\nIn 1948 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] or 1956 when the Yugoslavian president [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] visited Ethiopia, nobody was willing to give a presentation in front of [[Haile Selassie|king Haile Selase]] and [[Josip Broz Tito|Martial Tito]]. Then, the king asked Gibreab Teferi to introduce the army and the day's program. Gibreab gladly went onstage and gave a military salute and presented the program well. His family still has the picture of him giving speech on that historical day.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/titos-visit-to-ethiopia\n |title= Tito's Visit To Ethiopia 1956\n |date= 1 February 1956\n |website=\n |publisher= British Pathe\n |access-date=\n }}</ref>\n\n\nLater, he transferred to Takele Ena Sarawitu ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u1320\u1245\u120d \u12a5\u1293 \u1235\u122b\u12ca\u1271'}}), the Imperial Army's radio and newspaper department, where he worked as a journalist and writer. Gibreab Teferi reached the rank of Shalaqa-Basha ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u123b \u12a0\u1208\u1243 \u1263\u123b'}}) (commander of the colonel) before leaving the Imperial Guard in 1954. He received many awards for his ethics, loyalty, and service to his country.\n\n====Plays====\n\nGibreab Teferi wrote several plays, both during and after his time with the [[Kebur Zabagna]]. Some of these plays were never performed; others received recognition from military and government officials. One of Gibreab's most admirable talents was his ability to write plays in [[dramatic verse]]. \nHis plays contained poetry and lots of hidden meanings. Like the English William Shakespeare, Gibreab also adapted ancient tales into modern plays. One play, [[Astyages]] The Cruel Leader, tells the tale of [[Astyages]], the last king of the Median Empire (in modern-day [[Iran]]).

The failed coup d'\u00e9tat cost him his life and Gibreab Teferi and the [[Kebur Zabagna]] team received a six-month prison time, including the famous [[Tilahun Gessesse]] and a forced resignation from the royal Army. Most who worked with Gibreab Teferi know and appreciate his guts and his willingness to discuss the social inequality of his time through his music, short plays, or dramatic works like this one. To this day, most argue that Gibreab's play caused the coup d'\u00e9tat to happen; but, according to the investigation by the king [[Mengistu Neway]], \u1265\u122d\u130b\u12f4\u120d \u1300\u1290\u122b\u120d \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1271 \u1290\u12cb\u12ed and his comrades were planning this for a while and Gibreab wasn't considered a part of that, but the timing and the play itself became the straw that broke the camel's back.

In one competition, Gibreab's marches received first place and two of his marches received second place in different categories.\n\nHe was an accomplished musician, playing the clarinet and the traditional [[krar]], a stringed instrument similar to a lyre, as well as possessing a strong tenor voice. He taught himself to play the [[krar]], since it is a traditional instrument that one can learn by watching a master player and then practicing.  Gibreab learned modern music in the [[Kebur Zabagna]] from the Armenian instructor [[Armenians in Ethiopia|Kevork Nalbandian]], and become very good at playing clarinet. He also learned to read and write musical notes.

He wrote several unpublished plays, thousands of songs, and was in the process of publishing a book of plays and poems when he died in 1980 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]]. He also served in the Imperial Army ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b}}), rising to the rank of Shalaqa-Basha and was the primary Amharic lyricist for the Ras Band in the famous Ras Hotel, eventually becoming management there, where he worked until retirement.<ref name=\"Solomon\" />\n\n==Life==\nGibreab Teferi was born in 1915 E.C in the Bure Damot region of [[Gojjam]] to his father, the Commander of the Right Brigade, Qenyazmach Teferi Dasta (Amharic: \u1240\u129b\u12dd\u121b\u127d \u1270\u1348\u122a \u12f0\u1235\u1273), and his mother, Weyzero Semagne Tasama (Amharic: \u02c8\u12c8/\u122e \u1230\u1218\u129d \u1270\u1230\u121b).\nGibreab Teferi was married to Yeshi-Emebet Aregaye. He fathered ten children \u2013 four boys and six girls. As of 2018, five of his children reside in the United States and live in the [[Pacific Northwest]] near [[Seattle]], Washington. The other five reside in the capital of [[Ethiopia]], [[Addis Ababa]].\n\n===Early life===\n\nGibreab's parents separated when he was just nine months old. He was raised by his aunt, who lived in the same region. Gibreab received primary education in the traditional schools of the area, learning to read and write through the [[Christian Church|church]]. He became known for his fast learning skills in Ge\u2019ez /liturgical language and served as a [[Deacon]] at an early age. He studied under the tutelage of Aleka Teffera. Aleka Teffera had an affinity for music that he shared with his young student. Teffera had once been a high-ranking member of a musical group in [[Menelik II|Emperor Menelik's]] court in [[Addis Ababa]]. He taught young Gibreab many of the songs and lyrics in praise of [[Addis Ababa]], the capital city, which had been played at the emperor's palace at a special occasion which took place on Thursday, 17 November 1878 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]].\n\nGibreab made his first journey to [[Addis Ababa]] when he was a mere ten years old. Having graduated from the church school in his village, he went to the capital city to apply for a deaconship. He later described his first impressions: \u201cAs compared with the countryside, Arada (the current Piazza) was lovely, a paradise. Everything I saw was thrilling and attractive\u2026It might surprise you if I tell you that when I first saw the mounted statue of [[Menelik II|Menelik]], I almost ran away thinking that the horse would descend upon me and squash me like a fly! It was in stages that I got used to it!\"<ref>(From Ethiopian Herald, Vol. XLIII, Thursday 20 November 1986 (11 Hedar 1979) \"Oh! Addis Ababa, Oh Arad\" by Melese Telahoun)</ref>\n\nWhile in Addis Ababa, Gibreab stayed near [[St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa|St. George's Cathedral]], continuing to learn music (although in a way that was not, perhaps, traditional): He was begging for food, as was the custom for young students ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12e8\u1246\u120e \u1270\u121b\u122a'}}) at the time, when a waitress offered him a meal. As he was eating, he heard a traditional singer ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12a0\u12dd\u121b\u122a'}}) accompanied by a Krar, singing a beautiful song. He was so transfixed by the melody that the song become embedded in his mind (Telahoun).\n \nAfter two weeks in Addis Ababa, the young Gibreab returned to his village home of [[Gojjam]] to continue his studies there. He was forced to quit his education in 1929 EC, during the [[second Italo-Abyssinian War]] war of resistance against Italian Fascists. During the five-year occupation by Italy, Gibreab served with his uncle, Dagazmach Zalaka Dasta({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12f0\u1303\u12dd\u121b\u127d \u12d8\u1208\u1240 \u12f0\u1235\u1273'}}) in [[Gojjam]], in the Kola Dega Damot ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u1246\u120b \u12f0\u130b \u12f3\u121e\u1275'}}) region. He became a resistance fighter and tailor for the patriot ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12a0\u122d\u1260\u129b'}}), creating the coarse, wool, blanket-like garments ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12f0\u1260\u120e'}}) for the anti-fascist rebels and a fighter. Even in this situation his passion for music kept growing.\n\n===Kebur Zabagna (\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b) and Entertainment===\n\n[[File:KeburZabagnaCrew.jpg|thumb|Kebur Zabagna Crew \u2013 from the right Baheru Tadla and next to him Gibreab Teferi]]\n\nIn 1938 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]], Gibreab Teferi returned to [[Addis Ababa]] to find a city much changed from his previous visit 12 years prior. He told Melese Talahoun, the city had \"changed a lot; practically nothing was as it used to be. Everything was mixed-up.\" He had become a [[deacon]] in [[St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa|St. George's cathedral]] and was in the city looking for a job. He came upon an employment posting from the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]] ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}), looking for any person who could read and write. Gibreab could do both, so he applied. Through the long application and interview process, the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]]({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}) recruiters discovered that Gibreab was a talented poet. He was brought into the [[Kebur Zabagna|Imperial Army]] ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u12ad\u1261\u122d \u12d8\u1260\u129b'}}) as an official playwright and lyricist for the entertainment division.\n\nDuring his tenure with the [[Kebur Zabagna]], Gibreab wrote several plays, many as a source of education for the soldiers; his first play to be performed in the military was \"Don't forget your military duty\" (\u12c8\u1273\u12f0\u122d\u1290\u1275\u1215\u1295 \u12a0\u1275\u122d\u1233), which encourages the soldiers to be clean, honorable, and presentable. Years before the [[Kebur Zabagna]] created a theatrical department in 1949, Gibreab's plays were performed by the men; just like Shakespearean actors, some men wore dresses and played the role of women. Gibreab also wrote many lyrics for the Kebur Zabagna band and most of his lyrics were performed by the famous [[kebur Zabagna]] band which includes the Famous [[Tilahun Gessesse]], Tefera Kasa, [[Bizunesh Bekele]], and many more. His work lives on, because, even today, those same lyrics are performed by the famous Kebur Zabagna artists and are appreciated and enjoyed by many Ethiopians. \n[[File:Gibreab Teferi's resignation letter.jpg|thumb|Resignation Letter From Kebur Zabagna]]\n\nIn 1948 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] or 1956 when the Yugoslavian president [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] visited Ethiopia, nobody was willing to give a presentation in front of [[Haile Selassie|king Haile Selase]] and [[Josip Broz Tito|Martial Tito]]. Then, the king asked Gibreab Teferi to introduce the army and the day's program. Gibreab gladly went onstage and gave a military salute and presented the program well. His family still has the picture of him giving speech on that historical day.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/titos-visit-to-ethiopia\n |title= Tito's Visit To Ethiopia 1956\n |date= 1 February 1956\n |website=\n |publisher= British Pathe\n |access-date=\n }}</ref>\n\n\nLater, he transferred to Takele Ena Sarawitu ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u1320\u1245\u120d \u12a5\u1293 \u1235\u122b\u12ca\u1271'}}), the Imperial Army's radio and newspaper department, where he worked as a journalist and writer. Gibreab Teferi reached the rank of Shalaqa-Basha ({{lang-am|\u02c8\u123b \u12a0\u1208\u1243 \u1263\u123b'}}) (commander of the colonel) before leaving the Imperial Guard in 1954. He received many awards for his ethics, loyalty, and service to his country.\n\n====Plays====\n\nGibreab Teferi wrote several plays, both during and after his time with the [[Kebur Zabagna]]. Some of these plays were never performed; others received recognition from military and government officials. One of Gibreab's most admirable talents was his ability to write plays in [[dramatic verse]]. \nHis plays contained poetry and lots of hidden meanings. Like the English William Shakespeare, Gibreab also adapted ancient tales into modern plays. One play, [[Astyages]] The Cruel Leader, tells the tale of [[Astyages]], the last king of the Median Empire (in modern-day [[Iran]]). This play, written in [[dramatic verse]], was first published as a book in Ethiopia.\n\n[[File:Astyages the Cruel Leader (cover page).jpg|thumb|\"[[Astyages]] the cruel leader\" Gibreab's first book Published]]\n\nThis is an incomplete list of plays written by Gibreab:\n* \u12e8\u121e\u1275 \u1218\u12f3\u1292\u1275 \"Life Potion,\" 1940[[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] (the oldest recorded theater written, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u12c8\u1273\u12f0\u122d\u1290\u1275\u1215\u1295 \u12a0\u1275\u122d\u1233  \"Don't Forget Your military Duty,\" (presented for the army, first to be shown, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u12c8\u1273\u12f0\u122d \u1218\u1208\u12e8\u1275 \u12a0\u12ed\u1348\u122b\u121d \"A Soldier Is Not Afraid to Be Separated,\" (presented for the army, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u1262\u1270\u12cd \u12a0\u121b\u1228  \"Bi-taw Amara,\" (shown for military, military officials, and their families [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u12a0\u1235\u1274\u12a0\u1304\u1235 \u1328\u12ab\u1299 \u1308\u12e2  \"[[Astyages]] The Cruel Leader,\" 1950 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] ([[dramatic verse]], published as a book)\n* \u12e8\u1201\u1208\u1275 \u12a0\u1208\u121d \u1235\u12f0\u1270\u129e\u127d \"Refugee of Two World's,\" 1950\u20131953 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] (presented for higher officials, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u1235\u121b\u1295\u12eb  \"Eighty\", 1976 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] (passed government censorship but not shown for public, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u134d\u1245\u122d \u121d\u122d\u1325 \u1210\u12aa\u121d \u1290\u12cd  \"Love Is the Doctor,\" translated from the French play by [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[L'Amour m\u00e9decin]] (passed government censorship but not shown, [[dramatic verse]])\n* \u1270\u1260\u120b\u123d\u1276 \u12eb\u120d\u1240\u1228 \u1263\u120d \"The Prodigal Husband,\" 1976 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] (Passed government censorship but not shown, [[dramatic verse]])\n\nIn 1953 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]], the showing of \"Refugee of Two Worlds\" garnered Gibreab appreciation and recognition among elites, higher officials, friends, and relatives. After the play was over, the higher official who was sitting in front Brigadier-General [[Mengistu Neway]] \u1265\u122d\u130b\u12f4\u120d \u1300\u1290\u122b\u120d \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1271 \u1290\u12cb\u12ed was touched and crying throughout the show.

After that Brigadier-General [[Mengistu Neway]] \u1265\u122d\u130b\u12f4\u120d \u1300\u1290\u122b\u120d \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1271 \u1290\u12cb\u12ed went on to commit a coup d'\u00e9tat on the king [[Haile Selassie]]. The failed coup d'\u00e9tat cost him his life and Gibreab Teferi and the [[Kebur Zabagna]] team received a six-month prison time, including the famous [[Tilahun Gessesse]] and a forced resignation from the royal Army. Most who worked with Gibreab Teferi know and appreciate his guts and his willingness to discuss the social inequality of his time through his music, short plays, or dramatic works like this one. To this day, most argue that Gibreab's play caused the coup d'\u00e9tat to happen; but, according to the investigation by the king [[Mengistu Neway]], \u1265\u122d\u130b\u12f4\u120d \u1300\u1290\u122b\u120d \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1271 \u1290\u12cb\u12ed and his comrades were planning this for a while and Gibreab wasn't considered a part of that, but the timing and the play itself became the straw that broke the camel's back. To this day, Gibreab's colleagues respect him, because, as an artist, instead of trying to please his bosses or the king, he chose to be a voice for the poor and the voiceless.\n\n====Music====\n{{Quote box|align=right|quote=<poem><span style=\"font-size:200%; line-height: 1.3em;\">\u12c8\u12ed \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263 \u12c8\u12ed \u12a0\u122b\u12f3 \u1206\u12ed\n\u1210\u1308\u122d\u121d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1235\u12cd \u12ed\u1293\u134d\u1243\u120d \u12c8\u12ed</span>\n</poem>\n''Most Ethiopians Remember Gibreab Teferi by this lyrics''\n}}\n\nThroughout his career with the Imperial Army, Gibreab continued working with music, and wrote five military marches. Three of these marches were performed in a competition in 1953 [[Ethiopian calendar|EC]] at the Sergaga Tore School (\u1235\u122d\u1308\u129b \u1326\u122d \u1275\u121d\u1215\u122d\u1275 \u1264\u1275). In one competition, Gibreab's marches received first place and two of his marches received second place in different categories.\n\nHe was an accomplished musician, playing the clarinet and the traditional [[krar]], a stringed instrument similar to a lyre, as well as possessing a strong tenor voice. He taught himself to play the [[krar]], since it is a traditional instrument that one can learn by watching a master player and then practicing.  Gibreab learned modern music in the [[Kebur Zabagna]] from the Armenian instructor [[Armenians in Ethiopia|Kevork Nalbandian]], and become very good at playing clarinet. He also learned to read and write musical notes. Finally, he became an instructor and taught other Ethiopian musicians in the police orchestra and many others.<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book\n| last         = Tesema\n| first        = Solomon\n| date         = 1953\n| title        = Ya Yamuyachew Kewakebt\n| trans-title  = \n| url          = \n| language     = Amharic\n| work         = \n| location     = \n| access-date  = \n}}</ref>\n\nWhen Gibreab was put in prison because he was suspected of involvement in the Coup d'\u00e9tat, he wrote lyrics depicting the king as his lover to show how much he still loved his country.

Fronted by singer-songwriter [[Jay Kay]], the band were a prominent component of the London-based funk/jazz movement of the 1990s. Their sound draws from [[List of musical genres of the African diaspora|black music]] of the 1970s, and their lyrics and visual concepts occasionally deal with social and environmental idealism. They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The group has won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]], as well as one [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]]s.

They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]].

Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously.

Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the [[Varachha]] area of Surat, mostly by the people of the [[Patel]] community.<ref name=diamondhistory>{{cite journal|title=Diamond and Patels|citeseerx = 10.1.1.1026.5615|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat.

It is managed by the Community School Corporation of Eastern Hancock County. Schools in neighboring [[Wilkinson, Indiana|Wilkinson]], [[Shirley, Indiana|Shirley]], and [[Charlottesville, Indiana|Charlottesville]] consolidated in 1970 forming the Eastern Hancock district that includes all the eastern third of [[Hancock County, Indiana|Hancock County]].\n\n==History==\nAlthough Eastern Hancock's school district covers more area than any other school district in the county, it has the smallest number of enrolled students due to eastern [[Hancock County, Indiana|Hancock County]] being mainly rural. The Community School Corporation of Eastern Hancock County represents the consolidation of the school's three townships: Brown, Blue River and Jackson. The towns of [[Wilkinson, Indiana|Wilkinson]], [[Shirley, Indiana|Shirley]], [[Charlottesville, Indiana|Charlottesville]], [[Warrington, Indiana|Warrington]], [[Willow Branch, Indiana|Willow Branch]] and parts of [[Greenfield, Indiana|Greenfield]] are all in the Eastern Hancock School District.\n\nThe school began in 1964-65, but the new Eastern Hancock Junior-Senior High School facilities were completed in 1971. The Elementary building was completed in 1979 and the Middle School was completed in 1996.\n\nConsolidation History to become the Community School Corporation of  Eastern Hancock County:  \n* Eastern Hancock - Royals\n** Charlottesville - Eagles\n*** Westland -  Bears\n*** Blue River Township Schools \n*** Jackson Township Schools\n***Stinger School\n** Wilkinson - Bulldogs\n*** Shirley School\n*** Warrington School\n\n==Athletics==\nThe Eastern Hancock High School Royals are a member of the [[Mid-Eastern Conference]].
