Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store. At night, he and two friends wait outside the German bar in Union and beat up two drunk patrons on their way home, calling them fascists.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Part 2\n |DirectedBy = Minkie Spiro\n |WrittenBy = David Simon & Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers = 0.395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = October 1940. Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]]. Lindbergh later wins the election and becomes President.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = Part 3\n |DirectedBy = Minkie Spiro\n |WrittenBy = Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|30}}\n |Viewers = 0.357<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-30-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.30.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 31, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = May 1941. A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks. Alvin flourishes in Canada's military program, and is recruited by British intelligence to help steal a German [[radar]] device.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies. Philip, overwhelmed by everything happening around him, happily watches a Lindbergh newsreel, much to Herman's exasperation.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Part 5\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = 0.433<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 13, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = April 1942. The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside. When Herman returns home bloodied, Bess threatens to leave him and take the children to Canada if he continues his resistance.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Part 6\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = David Simon\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = 0.392<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-20-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.20.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 21, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = {{Plot|episode|date=April 2020}} September 1942. Violent anti-Semitic incidents escalate and spread throughout the country. Winchell is assassinated in [[Louisville]]. At his funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and denounces Lindbergh. Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's speech is short and makes no appeal to stop anti-Jewish violence. Billy Murphy, a fellow veteran from the Canadian Army, visits Alvin introducing him to a British agent who persuades Alvin to join a secretive [[anti-fascist]] group that wants to assassinate Lindbergh; Alvin's radar expertise is needed to track Lindbergh's plane. Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, claims that are taken up by Acting President Wheeler who declares [[martial law]] and order the arrests of prominent Jews including Bengelsdorf. The First Lady is detained in a psychiatric hospital. Concerned by reports from Kentucky, Bess attempts to contact Selma but is only able to reach a distraught Seldon, whose mother hasn't returned home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, and learn Selma has been murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn asks Bess for sanctuary, but Bess tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady, freed from hospital by her supporters, issues a statement calling for peace, the release of the Jewish detainees, and urges Congress to replace Wheeler and call an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf returns to his synagogue, finding his congregation all but gone. His claims that Lindbergh's presidency and subsequent disappearance were the result of a German blackmail operation are dismissed with skepticism. Alvin visits the Levins with his fiancee, but gets into a fistfight with Herman over Alvin's apparent indifference to national events. In November, the emergency election is marred by irregularities with some FDR voters being turned away at the polls and uncounted ballots being burned. The series ends without the results being revealed.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHBO announced on November 8, 2018, that it had ordered a six-episode miniseries based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' to be written by [[David Simon]] and [[Ed Burns]] and executive produced by Simon, Burns, Roth, alongside [[Joe Roth]], Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, [[Nina Noble]], [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], Susan Goldberg, and Dennis Stratton.

Herman is riled by the anti-war rhetoric of populist aviator hero [[Charles Lindbergh]] with its [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, but does not take the possibility of his running for the [[United States Presidency|Presidency]] seriously. Herman is offered a promotion, but this would require them to live in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]] where they would likely be the only Jews in the neighborhood. Disgusted by the patrons at a German-themed bar in Union, he decides to decline the offer. Alvin is fired from his job at a local [[Esso]] service station for stealing; he tells Sandy he took the blame for a friend. He moves out of the house after an argument with Herman. Bess's older sister Evelyn, who looks after their mother, is having an affair with a married man in New York; it soon becomes clear that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Philip's friend Earl, whose mother has a scandalous reputation, is a corrupting influence on him. Evelyn and Bess meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf, who is sympathetic to Lindbergh's anti-war message; Evelyn is charmed. Alvin secretly stays with a friend whose father runs a candy store. At night, he and two friends wait outside the German bar in Union and beat up two drunk patrons on their way home, calling them fascists.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Part 2\n |DirectedBy = Minkie Spiro\n |WrittenBy = David Simon & Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers = 0.395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = October 1940. Sandy eagerly attends a speech by Lindbergh, with Evelyn and Bengelsdorf present. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf later enter into a relationship, and Evelyn introduces him to her mother. Bengelsdorf assures Evelyn he will attempt to sway her family to his side politically. With Herman's assistance, Alvin takes a job as a driver for a wealthy man named Abe Steinheim, but quickly grows to find him crass and corrupt. To aid her family financially, Bess takes a retail job at an upper-class store, though she soon becomes unnerved by Lindbergh-supporting customers. Philip continues to learn delinquent behavior from Earl, including theft and following strangers around the city. Speaking at a Lindbergh rally, Bengelsdorf lavishly endorses Lindbergh, with Evelyn by his side. Disgusted by Bengelsdorf and the direction of the country, Alvin quits his job and enlists in the [[Canadian Army]].

A few months after Lindbergh's inauguration, anti-Semitic incidents have been rising in the United States. Lindbergh signs a neutrality agreement with [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also places Bengelsdorf in charge of a program called \"Just Folks,\" as part of the Office of American Absorption, which temporarily places Jewish boys into rural families to make them \"more American\"; Evelyn signs up Sandy to participate. Philip begins to have nightmares about Nazis. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Bess's mother's [[dementia]] has been worsening. As Bess's concern for her family's safety grows, she places them on a waiting list to potentially emigrate to Canada. The Levins take a trip to Washington, D.C., where they experience anti-Semitism among both citizens and the police. Herman ultimately gives his permission for Sandy to travel to Kentucky as part of Just Folks. Alvin flourishes in Canada's military program, and is recruited by British intelligence to help steal a German [[radar]] device.

Bess and Evelyn's mother passes away. Herman visits Alvin in the hospital and offers his support, but Alvin has grown aloof and disillusioned. Alvin is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], after which he is discharged and returns to New Jersey. In [[synagogue]], Sandy gives a presentation espousing Just Folks, after being designated a 'Recruitment Officer' by Evelyn. When Evelyn and Bengelsdorf join the Levins for [[Shabbat]], Herman clashes with Bengelsdorf's views and upbringing, including his father fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After Bengelsdorf proposes an expansion of Just Folks, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] invites him and Evelyn to a state dinner with [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (as all other Jewish representatives refused). Evelyn also secures an invitation for Sandy, which enrages Herman and Bess, who refuse to let Sandy attend. He responds by calling his parents \"ghetto Jews\" and \"worse than Hitler\". Evelyn dances with the German official at the dinner, which appears later on the [[newsreel]]s. The FBI, meanwhile, has been tracking Alvin after marking him a potential [[Communist]].  Earl leaves town to live with his grandmother after his mother is committed to a psychiatric hospital. Seldon's father dies. Philip, overwhelmed by everything happening around him, happily watches a Lindbergh newsreel, much to Herman's exasperation.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Part 5\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = Ed Burns\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = 0.433<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 13, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = April 1942. The Levins are forcibly signed up, by Evelyn, to participate in Homestead 42, Bengelsdorf's Just Folks expansion that relocates entire Jewish families. Bengelsdorf informs Bess that their participation will convince the FBI to take some heat off of Alvin. Philip expresses curiosity and concern about a [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence in Kentucky, and angrily asks Evelyn why his neighbor Seldon Wishnow, and Seldon's widowed mother Selma, weren't relocated instead. Misinterpreting this as a desire to be with his friend, Evelyn signs them up as well. Despite FBI threats, Herman intends to sue the OAA, but learns the legal process will take at least a year; instead, he quits his job to avoid the Homestead 42 obligation. Philip is overwhelmed with guilt when he realizes that he was the cause of Seldon's relocation to Kentucky, where he will almost certainly be unhappy. The FBI resumes tailing Alvin. Evelyn and Bengelsdorf marry in an extravagant ceremony unattended by the Levins. Outspoken radio host [[Walter Winchell]] escalates his anti-Lindbergh rhetoric; Bengelsdorf quickly gets him fired. Winchell announces a presidential run and Herman attends his rally, but violent Lindbergh supporters attack the attendees as the police stand aside. When Herman returns home bloodied, Bess threatens to leave him and take the children to Canada if he continues his resistance.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Part 6\n |DirectedBy = Thomas Schlamme\n |WrittenBy = David Simon\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = 0.392<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-20-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.20.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 21, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = {{Plot|episode|date=April 2020}} September 1942. Violent anti-Semitic incidents escalate and spread throughout the country. Winchell is assassinated in [[Louisville]]. At his funeral, New York Mayor [[Fiorello la Guardia]] eulogizes him and denounces Lindbergh. Bengelsdorf urges the First Lady to convince Lindbergh to issue a statement, but Lindbergh's speech is short and makes no appeal to stop anti-Jewish violence. Billy Murphy, a fellow veteran from the Canadian Army, visits Alvin introducing him to a British agent who persuades Alvin to join a secretive [[anti-fascist]] group that wants to assassinate Lindbergh; Alvin's radar expertise is needed to track Lindbergh's plane. Lindbergh's [[Spirit of St. Louis|plane]] vanishes. German radio spreads [[propaganda]] of a Jewish conspiracy, claims that are taken up by Acting President Wheeler who declares [[martial law]] and order the arrests of prominent Jews including Bengelsdorf. The First Lady is detained in a psychiatric hospital. Concerned by reports from Kentucky, Bess attempts to contact Selma but is only able to reach a distraught Seldon, whose mother hasn't returned home. Herman and Sandy drive to Kentucky to pick up Seldon, and learn Selma has been murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They encounter more Klan members on the way back to New Jersey. A terrified Evelyn asks Bess for sanctuary, but Bess tells her to leave and never return. The First Lady, freed from hospital by her supporters, issues a statement calling for peace, the release of the Jewish detainees, and urges Congress to replace Wheeler and call an emergency Presidential election. Bengelsdorf returns to his synagogue, finding his congregation all but gone. His claims that Lindbergh's presidency and subsequent disappearance were the result of a German blackmail operation are dismissed with skepticism. Alvin visits the Levins with his fiancee, but gets into a fistfight with Herman over Alvin's apparent indifference to national events. In November, the emergency election is marred by irregularities with some FDR voters being turned away at the polls and uncounted ballots being burned. The series ends without the results being revealed.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHBO announced on November 8, 2018, that it had ordered a six-episode miniseries based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' to be written by [[David Simon]] and [[Ed Burns]] and executive produced by Simon, Burns, Roth, alongside [[Joe Roth]], Jeffrey Kirschenbaum, [[Nina Noble]], [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], Susan Goldberg, and Dennis Stratton.

(November 7, 1942 in [[Valladolid]], [[Castilla y Leon]], [[Spain]] &ndash; November 16, 1989 in [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]]) was a [[scholar]], [[Social psychology|social psychologist]], [[philosopher]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]]. He was one of the victims of the [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador]]\n\n== Academic career ==\nMart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society of Jesus in [[Ordu\u00f1a]], [[Spain]], on September 28, 1959. Shortly after, he was transferred to the novitiate of [[Villagarc\u00eda de Campos|Villagarc\u00eda]] and then sent to [[Central America]], where he completed his second year in the novitiate of the Society of Jesus.\n\nAt the end of September 1961, he began his studies in classical [[humanities]] at the [[Catholic University|Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador]] in [[Quito]]. On graduating, he travelled to [[Bogot\u00e1]], where he studied philosophy at the [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]], run by the Jesuits. In 1964 he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[philosophy]] and in 1965 his [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] (licenciatura) in philosophy and [[literature]]. In 1966 he returned to El Salvador, where he got a job as a teacher and academic coordinator at the [[Externado San Jos\u00e9]]. In 1967, he started teaching at the [[Universidad Centroamericana \"Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as\"]] (UCA).\n\nHe travelled to [[Frankfurt]] in 1967 to study [[theology]]. Returning to San Salvador to continue his studies, he obtained his bachelor's degree from [[St John Berchmans University College, Heverlee]], [[Belgium]], in 1970. He then began studying [[psychology]] at UCA, where he was also lecturer. In 1975 he completed his licentiate in psychology.\n\nIn 1971 and 1972 he taught psychology in the [[National Nursing Academy]] in [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]]. Later he was dean of Students between 1972 and 1975, and a member of the University Board, at UCA. From 1971 until 1974 he was head of the [[editorial board]] of the [[academic journal]] ''[[Estudios Centroamericanos]]'' (''ECA'').\n\nIn 1977 he earned a [[master's degree]] in [[social sciences]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and two years later, in 1979, a [[Ph.D.]] in social and [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organisational psychology]] from the same institution. In his master's [[thesis]], he discussed social [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[group conflict]] in El Salvador, a theme which he continued in his doctoral dissertation which focused on [[population density]] of the lowest [[social class]]es in El Salvador.\n\nOn completing his studies he returned to San Salvador, where he lectured in psychology at UCA. By 1981 he was Academic Vice-[[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and member of the Board of Directors. In 1982 he became head of the psychology department. In 1986 he founded and directed the [[University Institute of Public Opinion, IUDOP]]. In 1989, the academic vice-rector's office was split in two and Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 became director of [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] studies and [[research]].\n\nHe was a member of the editorial board of [[UCA Editores]] and ''Estudios Centroamericanos'' (''ECA''), the [[Salvadoran Journal of Psychology]] and the [[Costa Rica]]n magazine ''[[Pol\u00e9mica]]''. He was a visiting [[professor]] at the [[Central University of Venezuela]], the [[Universidad del Zulia]] in [[Maracaibo]], the [[University of Puerto Rico]], [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Universidad Complutense]] in [[Madrid]] and [[Universidad de Costa Rica]] in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]. He was a member of the [[American Psychological Association]] as well as the [[Salvadoran Psychological Association]]. He was the vice-president of the [[Mesoamerican]] division of the [[Interamerican Psychological Society]].\n\nMart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 published eleven books and a long list of [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Science|scientific]] articles, in various [[Latin America]]n and [[North America]]n academic journals and magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |title=P.

He believed that students of psychology should learn to analyse human [[behaviour]] in the location of their practice, bearing in mind the criteria outlined for that location.\n\nIn his writings and [[lecture]]s he rejected the idea of universal, impartial psychology, and developed a psychology that was critically committed with the projects for alternative societies that existed in Latin America. For him, the [[psychical]] situation of individuals could either be an abnormal reaction to normal circumstances, or a normal reaction to abnormal conditions.\n\nFor Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3, the solution to [[mental health]] problems in societies characterised by [[oppression]], where \"[[normal abnormality]]\" prevails, is the transformation of society to transcend the [[historical reality]] of oppression. Psychologists cannot ignore the influence that difficult contexts have on mental health. Furthermore, if they do, then they become accomplices to the social injustices (or abnormalities) that may have caused these mental health problems.\n\nHe integrated diverse [[Theory|theories]], and was so convinced of the benefits to be gained by the \"[[de-ideologise|de-ideologising]]\" potential of social psychology that he openly questioned the theoretical [[Model (abstract)|models]] of [[mainstream]] psychology. He considered the latter inadequate to address the effects of the structural [[violence]] that prevailed in El Salvador.\n\n==Continuing impact==\nHis work inspired the development of [[liberation psychology]] in Latin America and influenced [[community psychology]] and some strands of [[social psychology]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Writings for a Liberation Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsforliber00igna |author=Ignacio Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 |editor=Adrianne Aron |editor2=Shawn Corne |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780674962477 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>Dykstra, W.

Nobody is going to return the dead and the disappeared to their families. What can and must be publicly restored [are] the victims' names and their dignity, through a formal recognition of the injustice of what has occurred, and, wherever possible, material reparation.... Those who clamour for social reparation are not asking for vengeance. Nor are they blindly adding difficulties to a historical process that is already by no means easy. On the contrary, they are promoting the personal and social viability of a new society, truly democratic.\" <ref>Ignacio Martin-Baro, \"Reparations: Attention Must be Paid\", in ''Transitional Justice: How Emerging Democracies Reckon with Former Regimes'', ed.

In 1964 he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[philosophy]] and in 1965 his [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] (licenciatura) in philosophy and [[literature]]. In 1966 he returned to El Salvador, where he got a job as a teacher and academic coordinator at the [[Externado San Jos\u00e9]]. In 1967, he started teaching at the [[Universidad Centroamericana \"Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as\"]] (UCA).\n\nHe travelled to [[Frankfurt]] in 1967 to study [[theology]]. Returning to San Salvador to continue his studies, he obtained his bachelor's degree from [[St John Berchmans University College, Heverlee]], [[Belgium]], in 1970. He then began studying [[psychology]] at UCA, where he was also lecturer. In 1975 he completed his licentiate in psychology.\n\nIn 1971 and 1972 he taught psychology in the [[National Nursing Academy]] in [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]]. Later he was dean of Students between 1972 and 1975, and a member of the University Board, at UCA. From 1971 until 1974 he was head of the [[editorial board]] of the [[academic journal]] ''[[Estudios Centroamericanos]]'' (''ECA'').\n\nIn 1977 he earned a [[master's degree]] in [[social sciences]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and two years later, in 1979, a [[Ph.D.]] in social and [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organisational psychology]] from the same institution. In his master's [[thesis]], he discussed social [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[group conflict]] in El Salvador, a theme which he continued in his doctoral dissertation which focused on [[population density]] of the lowest [[social class]]es in El Salvador.\n\nOn completing his studies he returned to San Salvador, where he lectured in psychology at UCA. By 1981 he was Academic Vice-[[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and member of the Board of Directors. In 1982 he became head of the psychology department. In 1986 he founded and directed the [[University Institute of Public Opinion, IUDOP]]. In 1989, the academic vice-rector's office was split in two and Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 became director of [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] studies and [[research]].\n\nHe was a member of the editorial board of [[UCA Editores]] and ''Estudios Centroamericanos'' (''ECA''), the [[Salvadoran Journal of Psychology]] and the [[Costa Rica]]n magazine ''[[Pol\u00e9mica]]''. He was a visiting [[professor]] at the [[Central University of Venezuela]], the [[Universidad del Zulia]] in [[Maracaibo]], the [[University of Puerto Rico]], [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Universidad Complutense]] in [[Madrid]] and [[Universidad de Costa Rica]] in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]. He was a member of the [[American Psychological Association]] as well as the [[Salvadoran Psychological Association]]. He was the vice-president of the [[Mesoamerican]] division of the [[Interamerican Psychological Society]].\n\nMart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 published eleven books and a long list of [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Science|scientific]] articles, in various [[Latin America]]n and [[North America]]n academic journals and magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |title=P.

He believed that students of psychology should learn to analyse human [[behaviour]] in the location of their practice, bearing in mind the criteria outlined for that location.\n\nIn his writings and [[lecture]]s he rejected the idea of universal, impartial psychology, and developed a psychology that was critically committed with the projects for alternative societies that existed in Latin America. For him, the [[psychical]] situation of individuals could either be an abnormal reaction to normal circumstances, or a normal reaction to abnormal conditions.\n\nFor Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3, the solution to [[mental health]] problems in societies characterised by [[oppression]], where \"[[normal abnormality]]\" prevails, is the transformation of society to transcend the [[historical reality]] of oppression. Psychologists cannot ignore the influence that difficult contexts have on mental health. Furthermore, if they do, then they become accomplices to the social injustices (or abnormalities) that may have caused these mental health problems.\n\nHe integrated diverse [[Theory|theories]], and was so convinced of the benefits to be gained by the \"[[de-ideologise|de-ideologising]]\" potential of social psychology that he openly questioned the theoretical [[Model (abstract)|models]] of [[mainstream]] psychology. He considered the latter inadequate to address the effects of the structural [[violence]] that prevailed in El Salvador.\n\n==Continuing impact==\nHis work inspired the development of [[liberation psychology]] in Latin America and influenced [[community psychology]] and some strands of [[social psychology]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Writings for a Liberation Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsforliber00igna |author=Ignacio Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3 |editor=Adrianne Aron |editor2=Shawn Corne |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780674962477 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>Dykstra, W.

Nobody is going to return the dead and the disappeared to their families. What can and must be publicly restored [are] the victims' names and their dignity, through a formal recognition of the injustice of what has occurred, and, wherever possible, material reparation.... Those who clamour for social reparation are not asking for vengeance. Nor are they blindly adding difficulties to a historical process that is already by no means easy. On the contrary, they are promoting the personal and social viability of a new society, truly democratic.\" <ref>Ignacio Martin-Baro, \"Reparations: Attention Must be Paid\", in ''Transitional Justice: How Emerging Democracies Reckon with Former Regimes'', ed.

A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc. In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open-source software|open-source]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and subsequently renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]]. Oracle Grid Engine (6.2u6) moved to a closed-source model providing binaries with the distribution but no source code. As a result, the project's open-source repository no longer reflected changes made by Oracle and users were prevented from contributing code changes.

A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc. In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open-source software|open-source]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and subsequently renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]]. Oracle Grid Engine (6.2u6) moved to a closed-source model providing binaries with the distribution but no source code. As a result, the project's open-source repository no longer reflected changes made by Oracle and users were prevented from contributing code changes.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|295x295px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. \n\nThe first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3732|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Mughalsarai (MGS) WDM-2 18233 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3798|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Bondamunda (BNDM) WDM-2 18299 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|289x289px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many Broad Gauge countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram [[Dynamic braking|DBR]]'s.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni(KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed asErode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed asRatlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Variants ==\n\n=== WDM-3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-3A}}\nThe WDM-3A class are actually upgraded WDM-2 designed to produce more power ( 3100hp instead of 2600hp) and increased reliability (roller bearings instead of conventional ALCO bearings). Except for some 150 units, the rest are actually rebuilt WDM-2.

The class was manufactured till end of 2015. All the older locomotives built by DLW had regular WDM-2 type square short hood profile and control stand position. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by High adhesion Fabricated bogies for better traction and Stability.\n\nThey are hugely successful with about 1163 units of this class have been produced.They can be found all over [[Indian Railways|India]] doing all kinds of duties like hauling freight and passenger service to [[Switcher|shunting]] and departmental works.\n\n\n\n<br />\n=== WDM-7 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-7}}\n[[File:WDM7 BioDiesel.JPG|left|thumb|238x238px|A [[Indian locomotive class WDM-7|WDM-7]] can be recognized by lack of grilles on the short hood]]\nThey are lower powered('''2000 hp instead of 2600 hp)''' version of the WDM-2.

A few were at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] earlier but later all were transferred to [[Tondiarpet railway station|Tondiarpet]] seen shunting at Chennai Central or for light passenger haulage. Some are at the thermal power station, Chennai.\n\nThese Co-Co diesel-electrics were designed for branch-line duties (top speed 105 km/h). They have two 3-axle bogies and are similar to the WDM-2 in appearance. The power-pack is a 12-cylinder ALCO 251B unit. They were formerly housed at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]] and [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] also. They are reliable and rugged locomotives even though low powered. They can be easily recognized by the lack of grilles on the short hood. Two locos are running on a mixture of bio-diesel and diesel. All 15 are still in service.\n\n\n=== WDP-1 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDP-1}}\nIt is a lower powered passenger ('''2300 hp)''' version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]]. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by Bo-Bo fabricated bogies. They were not hugely successful. About 69 units have been produced with 60 locos still being in service.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|295x295px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. \n\nThe first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3732|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Mughalsarai (MGS) WDM-2 18233 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3798|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Bondamunda (BNDM) WDM-2 18299 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|289x289px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many Broad Gauge countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram [[Dynamic braking|DBR]]'s.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni(KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed asErode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed asRatlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Variants ==\n\n=== WDM-3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-3A}}\nThe WDM-3A class are actually upgraded WDM-2 designed to produce more power ( 3100hp instead of 2600hp) and increased reliability (roller bearings instead of conventional ALCO bearings). Except for some 150 units, the rest are actually rebuilt WDM-2.  Rebuilt WDM3As can be identified by a \u201cR\u201d at the end of their Road Number.\n\n=== WDG-2/3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDG-2/3A}}It is the dedicated freight version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] and shares the same engine and horsepower rating with [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]].The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by High adhesion Fabricated bogies for better traction and Stability. They are hugely successful with about 1163 units of this class have been produced.\n\n=== WDM-7 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-7}}\n[[File:WDM7 BioDiesel.JPG|left|thumb|238x238px|A [[Indian locomotive class WDM-7|WDM-7]] can be recognized by lack of grilles on the short hood]]\nThey are lower powered('''2000 hp instead of 2600 hp)''' version of the WDM-2. These locos were built from 1987 to 1989. A few were at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] earlier but later all were transferred to [[Tondiarpet railway station|Tondiarpet]] seen shunting at Chennai Central or for light passenger haulage. Some are at the thermal power station, Chennai.\n\nThese Co-Co diesel-electrics were designed for branch-line duties (top speed 105 km/h). They have two 3-axle bogies and are similar to the WDM-2 in appearance. The power-pack is a 12-cylinder ALCO 251B unit. They were formerly housed at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]] and [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] also. They are reliable and rugged locomotives even though low powered. They can be easily recognized by the lack of grilles on the short hood. Two locos are running on a mixture of bio-diesel and diesel. All 15 are still in service.\n\n\n=== WDP-1 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDP-1}}\nIt is a lower powered passenger ('''2300 hp)''' version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]]. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by Bo-Bo fabricated bogies. They were not hugely successful. About 69 units have been produced with 60 locos still being in service. They are easily identified by baldie grille-less short hood.\n\n<br />\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=60em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Former Sheds ==\n\n* [[Andal Junction railway station|Andal]] (UDL)\n* [[Bardhaman railway station|Bardhaman]] (BWN)\n* [[Bokaro Steel City railway station|Bokaro Steel City]] (BKSC)\n* [[Bondamunda railway station|Bondamunda]] (BNDM) \n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] (ERS)- The very last WDM-2 (18701) was removed from service on june, 2019 after being in the shed for 38 years.\n* [[Diesel loco shed, Erode|Erode]] (ED)\n* [[Gondal railway station|Gonda]] (GD)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Gooty|Gooty]] (GY)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Guntakal|Guntakal]] (GTL)\n* [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]] (HWH)\n* [[Itarsi Junction railway station|Itarsi]] (ET)\n* [[Izzatnagar railway station|Izzatnagar Loco Shed]] (IZN)\n* [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (KYN)\n* [[Kazipet railway station|Kazipet]] (KZJ)\n* [[Kharagpur Junction railway station|Kharagpur]] (KGP)\n* [[Krishnarajapuram railway station|Krishnarajapuram]] (KJM)\n* [[Lucknow Charbagh railway station|Lucknow]] (LKO)\n* [[Ludhiana Junction railway station|Ludhiana]] (LDH)\n* [[Moula Ali Railway Station|Moula Ali]] (MLY)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Pune|Pune]] (PUNE)\n* [[Patratu railway station|Loco Shed Patratu]] (PTRU)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ratlam|Ratlam]] (RTM)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Samastipur|Samastipur]] (SPJ)\n* [[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]] (TKD)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Vatva|Vatva]] (VTA)\n* [[Visakhapatnam railway station|Visakhapatnam]] (VSKP)\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* GOC: ICF Rajdhani livery but red replaced by green.

FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997.

FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android.

is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]]. FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

It stars [[Nicholas Hope]] and Carmel Johnson.\n\n==Plot==\nBubby is a 35-year-old man who has never set foot outside his mother's dingy apartment in the back of a printing press in an industrial area of [[Adelaide]].  In addition to beating and sexually abusing him, she confines him to the apartment, telling him that the air outside is poisonous and telling him he will die if he tries to leave. Bubby eventually escapes, joins up with a rock band, and embarks on a confused but [[nihilistic]] journey of self-discovery and shocking mayhem.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicholas Hope]] as Bubby\n* Claire Benito as Mam\n* Ralph Cotterill as Pop\n* Carmel Johnson as Angel\n* Paul Philpot as Paul (singer)\n* Mark Brouggy as Mark (roadie)\n* Todd Telford as Little Greg\n* Paul Simpson as Big Greg\n* Stephen Smooker as Middle Greg\n* Peter Monaghan as Steve\n* Rachael Huddy as herself\n\n==Production background==\nShortly after he had graduated from film school, Rolf de Heer and Ritchie Singer collaborated on the idea of what would eventually become ''Bad Boy Bubby''. For most of the 1980s, de Heer collected ideas and wrote them on index cards. In 1987, he took a hiatus from making ''Bubby'' index cards, but in 1989 he resumed work. Sometime between 1989 and 1990, he saw the short film ''Confessor Caressor'' starring [[Nicholas Hope]] (which would eventually be included on the bonus DVD when ''Bad Boy Bubby'' was first released on DVD in 2004) and tracked him down. In 1991, he began work on the actual script.\n\nAfter he heard a rumour about the reintroduction of the death penalty to Australia, de Heer was angered and rewrote the ending so that Bubby would be executed at the end of the film. This ending was scrapped when the rumour proved to be false.\n\nThe people with [[cerebral palsy]] Bubby meets at the 1 hour 30 minute mark are not actors, but actual disabled people. Hope, a devout Catholic, found the scenes where Bubby curses God in front of Angel's parents difficult to film.\n\n==Audio and visual innovation==\nDirector de Heer describes the film as one large experiment, especially in the method used to record the dialogue: [[Binaural recording|binaural microphones]] were sewn into the wig worn by leading actor Nicholas Hope, one above each ear. This method gave the sound track a unique sound that closely resembled what the character would actually be hearing. The film also used 31 individual [[director of photography|directors of photography]] to shoot different scenes. Once Bubby leaves the apartment a different director of photography is used for every location until the last third of the film, allowing an individual visual slant on everything Bubby sees for the first time. No director of photography was allowed to refer to the work of the others.<ref>{{cite web | last=de Heer | first=Rolf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304162301/http://www.angelfire.com/movies/badboybubby/interview.htm | archivedate=4 March 2008 | url=http://www.angelfire.com/movies/badboybubby/interview.htm | title=Directors Statement \u2013 London Film Festival | year=1993 | accessdate=12 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
