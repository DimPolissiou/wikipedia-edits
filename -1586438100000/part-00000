The population is measured on a national level, independently by each country's statistical bureau. [[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term ''t\u00e4tort'' (urban settlement), [[Statistics Finland]] also uses ''t\u00e4tort'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and ''taajama'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Statistics Denmark]] uses ''byomr\u00e5de'' (city), while [[Statistics Norway]] uses ''tettsted'' (urban settlement).\n\nA uniform statistical definition between the [[Nordic countries]] was agreed upon in 1960,<ref name=\"NE-Definition\">{{cite web|title=Nationalencyklopedin - T\u00e4tort|url=http://www.ne.se/t%C3%A4tort|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|quote=\"Translation: 'a for the Nordic countries shared statistical definition of built-up area with at least 200 residents, not more than 200 m between each other (without regard to the ward, municipal or county boundaries)'\"}}</ref> which defines an urban area as a continuous built-up area whose population is at least 200 inhabitants and where the maximum distance between residences is 200 metres; discounting roads, parking spaces, parks, sports grounds and cemeteries \u2013 without regard to the ward, municipal or county boundaries.<ref name=\"NE-Definition\" /><ref name=\"SCB-Definition\">{{cite web|title=Localities 2010: Population, age and gender|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/MI/MI0810/2010A01C/MI0810_2010A01C_SM_MI38SM1203.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|quote=A densely built area includes any cluster of buildings with at least 200 inhabitants, unless the distance between the houses exceeds 200 metres.

[...] Even if the distance between buildings exceeds 200 metres, the locality should not be divided if the area between the buildings is used for public purposes such as roads, parking spaces, parks, sports grounds and cemeteries. The same applies to undeveloped areas such as storage sites, railways and docks.page=21|language=Swedish, English}}</ref> Despite the uniform definition, the various statistical bureaus have different approaches in conducting these measurements, resulting in slight variation between the different countries.{{efn|For example, Statistics Finland utilizes a {{convert|62500|m2}} grid system for analyzing population, resulting in slight measurement differences between it and the other Nordic statistical bureaus.}}\n\nDespite belonging to the Nordic countries, [[Iceland]] does not follow the same definition of \"urban area\" for statistical purposes. The Nordic definition is unique to the four other countries, and should not be confused with the international concepts of [[metropolitan area]] or [[urban area|urban areas in general]]. In 2010, Finland changed its definition ([https://www.stat.fi/tup/vl2010/art_2011-12-16_001_sv.html stat.fi]). This means that according to official statistics, the land area covered by urban areas is three times larger in Finland than in Norway though the total urban population is roughly the same ([https://www.ssb.no/befolkning/statistikker/beftett/aar/2016-12-06 ssb.no]). It also means that while the population of Danish \u201cbyomr\u00e5der\u201d is usually less than half of the population of the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d defined by Eurostat, the population of a Finnish \u201ct\u00e4tort\u201d is usually around 80% of the respective \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d defined by Eurostat. In 2013, the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d of Aarhus thus had a population of 845,971 while the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d of Tampere had a population of f 364,992. According to official statistics, however, the \u201ct\u00e4tort\u201d Tampere is larger than the \u201cbyomr\u00e5de\u201d Aarhus ([http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en eurostat.ec]). This suggests that direct comparison between Finland and the other Nordic countries may be problematic. \n==List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Rank !! City / urban&nbsp;settlement !!

The Nordic definition is unique to the four other countries, and should not be confused with the international concepts of [[metropolitan area]] or [[urban area|urban areas in general]]. In 2010, Finland changed its definition ([https://www.stat.fi/tup/vl2010/art_2011-12-16_001_sv.html stat.fi]). This means that according to official statistics, the land area covered by urban areas is three times larger in Finland than in Norway though the total urban population is roughly the same ([https://www.ssb.no/befolkning/statistikker/beftett/aar/2016-12-06 ssb.no]). It also means that while the population of Danish \u201cbyomr\u00e5der\u201d is usually less than half of the population of the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d defined by Eurostat, the population of a Finnish \u201ct\u00e4tort\u201d is usually around 80% of the respective \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d defined by Eurostat. In 2013, the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d of Aarhus thus had a population of 845,971 while the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d of Tampere had a population of f 364,992. According to official statistics, however, the \u201ct\u00e4tort\u201d Tampere is larger than the \u201cbyomr\u00e5de\u201d Aarhus ([http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en eurostat.ec]). This suggests that direct comparison between Finland and the other Nordic countries may be problematic. \n==List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Rank !! City / urban&nbsp;settlement !!

Don\u2019t read them.\n\n,\n\n.\n\n<br />\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53&nbsp;billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.<ref>Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall,   \"Plummeting Newspaper Ad Revenue Sparks New Wave of Changes: With global newspaper print advertising on pace for worst decline since recession, publishers cut costs and restructure\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/plummeting-newspaper-ad-revenue-sparks-new-wave-of-changes-1476955801?cx_navSource=cx_picks&cx_tag=collabctx&cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2016]</ref>\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of [[online advertising]] are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

Soon after, weekly papers began being published in New York and Philadelphia. These early newspapers followed the British format and were usually four pages long. They mostly carried news from Britain and content depended on the editor's interests. In 1783, the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' became the first American daily.<ref>{{cite journal|date=July 1965|title=Benjamin Towne: The Precarious Career of a Persistent Printer|journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]]|volume=89|issue=3|pages=316\u2013330|jstor=20089817|last1=Teeter|first1=Dwight L}}</ref>\n\nIn 1752, [[John Bushell]] published the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', which claims to be \"Canada's first newspaper.\" However, its official descendant, the ''Royal Gazette'', is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the ''Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph''. It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.

Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of Iran|Persian]] Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.<ref>Stavrianos, p. 211.</ref> The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]].

In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour.<ref>Philip B. Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130\u2013133</ref> Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.\n\nIn 1830, the first inexpensive \"[[penny press]]\" newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston ''[[Boston Evening Transcript|Transcript]]''.<ref>David R.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\n====National====\n{{See also|List of national newspapers}}\n[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991.

As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent.

For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;\u2013 early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044034/http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 March 2008|title=wallstreetcosmos.com|publisher=wallstreetcosmos.com|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref> Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as [[newsletter|information sheets for merchants]]. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9.

Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

[[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.

Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.<ref>Stavrianos, p. 211.</ref> The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]].

Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130\u2013133</ref> Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists.

This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&nbsp;\u2013 State of the Media 2004|access-date=27 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828204802/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;\u2013 early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.

The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The third test was played in Auckland at the Domain with a huge crowd of 24,300 present to see New Zealand go down 23-34<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Third League Test/Australia v New Zealand/Win for the Visitors/Score 34 Points to 23/Fast and Open Game\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17259\n| date = 1919-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190908.2.119\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. While Iles 4th and final appearance for New Zealand came at the Auckland Domain once again with New Zealand being trounced 2-32 to lose the series 1-3<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Australia v New Zealand\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17265\n| date = 1919-09-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190915.2.130\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

The year was to end sadly for Iles though as his father Albert collapsed and died while playing bowls on the Tauranga South bowling green December 8, 1926. He was buried at Purewa Cemetery, in Meadowbank, Auckland<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn July 1929 George Iles brother Arthur (who was a councillor in Tauranga from 1925 to 1938 deputy mayor at one point)<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga Mayors and Councillors\n| publisher = Tauranga Memories: Tauranga Local History\n| url =http://tauranga.kete.net.nz/tauranga_local_history/topics/show/2670-tauranga-mayors-and-councillors\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref> wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] defending his brother as a player and coach in the Tauranga representative team.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to Eden Park, this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at Rotorua with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the Bay of Plenty Times about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in Australia and Auckland than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the kingdom of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character who was inspired by a mutual friend. Although they initially struggled to develop their idea, the experience of touring Europe and researching the work of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from European-setting mid-20th-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of Alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] was done in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] composed the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It received generally-positive reviews, although the film's approach to its subject matter, its fragmented storytelling, and its characterization were criticized. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was on the [[BBC]]'s list of [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|100 greatest 21st-century films]]. It earned $173&nbsp;million in box-office revenue worldwide, bolstered by its crossover appeal to young, casual moviegoers. The film led the [[87th Academy Awards]] with nine nominations (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) and received several other honors, chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab, [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by their attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter stormtroopers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

The filmmakers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced by the format.<ref name=asc /> They formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]]'s Technovision series of [[zoom lens|zoom]] and [[prime lens|prime anamorphic lenses]]. The Cooke lenses produced a soft, diffuse composition, without the sharpness of [[Panavision]] lenses.<ref name=asc />\n\nYeoman lit interior shots with tungsten (incandescent) fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]], rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps; the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting.

The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest-set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cited the observatory and hotel shots as best demonstrating his special-effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, however, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces.

Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the kingdom of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently-befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character who was inspired by a mutual friend. Although they initially struggled to develop their idea, the experience of touring Europe and researching the work of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from European-setting mid-20th-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of Alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] was done in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] composed the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It received generally-positive reviews, although the film's approach to its subject matter, its fragmented storytelling, and its characterization were criticized. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was on the [[BBC]]'s list of [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|100 greatest 21st-century films]]. It earned $173 million in box-office revenue worldwide, bolstered by its crossover appeal to young, casual moviegoers. The film led the [[87th Academy Awards]] with nine nominations (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) and received several other honors, chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab, [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by their attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter stormtroopers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]], rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps; the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting.

The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest-set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cited the observatory and hotel shots as best demonstrating his special-effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, however, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces.

Alex, who is married, later confronts Saanvi at the hospital about the incident saying it cannot happen again, but Saanvi has no memory of the event.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Airplane Bottles\n| DirectedBy      = [[Ramaa Mosley]]\n| WrittenBy       = Matthew Lau & MW Cartozian Wilson\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|9}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10209\n| Viewers         = 3.67<ref name=\"2.09\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-9-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.9.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = When Zeke goes to see Saanvi about the frostbite he is slowly developing, he finds that Saanvi has been developing short-term memory loss causing him to call in Alex. Two [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] agents arrive at the 129th Precinct to presumably discuss Jared's involvement with the Xers, but they instead question Michaela about the cases she solves using mysterious means. Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful. Recognizing the union rep from a previous Xer meeting, Jared has to arrest Michaela before the relocated meeting in order to keep her from getting killed by the union rep.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Course Deviation\n| DirectedBy      = [[Michael Smith (director)|Michael Smith]]\n| WrittenBy       = Laura Putney & Margaret Easley\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|16}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10210\n| Viewers         = 4.29<ref name=\"2.10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = After Michaela is bailed out, Jared and Kate reveal to her that Jared has been working undercover to disrupt the Xers. Grace gets a calling about a bridge over the Harlem River. She and Ben go there and find Adrian, who had the same calling. Grace\u2019s water breaks and Ben rushes her to the hospital. Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes). It turns out the specialist surgeon who can save both Grace and the baby is the man rescued by Adrian. Despite this, Adrian tells Ben he still does not believe the callings are ultimately good. Jared is called to the bar where Billy and other Xers are holding Zeke captive. Simon arrives with Erika and orders Zeke to be killed, which is heard by Michaela and others through the bug. This leads to Simon, Erika, Billy, and two other Xers being arrested during the police raid. Tamara accuses Jared of only getting close to her to capture the Xers which Jared denies.

Michaela works with Jared to follow Oscar's steps, resulting in a bust at a meth lab run by ex-con Jace Baylor.

Following an Xer meeting, Simon advises Jared to keep an eye on Billy as he can be a loose cannon. Michaela and Drea witness Jared leaving the bar and kissing Tamara. After Drea infiltrate the bar and interacts with Billy, Michaela finds that Billy has had some arrest records. As the ruined nightclub is used for memorials, Ben's latest Calling takes him to a zen mediation center. When he brings Olive, another chanting Calling leads them underground where they find TJ still alive underground. With a warrant from Judge Trilling, Michaela secretly plants a bug in the bar, obtains evidence Jared is working with the Xers, and gives it to Bowers. Bowers privately shares the information with Jared. Saanvi kisses her former lover and fellow doctor, Alex, in a park.

Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful.

Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes).

All of its people are [[Sunni]] [[Kurds]] and the majority of them speak both [[Gorani language]] and [[Sorani Kurdish]]. Goran is also the name of the tribe that comprises the majority of the people in Bardarash district. Bardarash is considered as the second [[Kirkuk]] because of its oil resources. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Bardarash town.jpg|thumb|A landscape of central villages of the Bardarash Township]]\nAt the era of Ottoman Empire, Bardarash was recognized as a district (Nahiya) in 1879. At the time of Ottoman Empire and until the 1970s, it was known as \u2018Ashair Al Sab\u2019aa, the meaning of which is \"Seven Tribes\" in [[English language|English]], because it is said that there are seven major tribes which lived and still live in Bardarash; they are - Rashgary 55%, Gezh 23%, Bot 11%, Shekh-Bzeni 2%, Khidiry 1%, Zangana 1% and others 7%. All of them are called Gorani. But also other tribes live in this area and some of them migrated in the four last decades of 20th century, such as Surchi, Zebar, Sharafan etc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Yaseen Hasan Goran, Xazir Magazine, Issue 2 - 15</ref>{{better source needed}}\n\nBardarash was formerly joined to Akre, and they were joined to Ninewa province until the Uprising of 1991, after which both towns were liberated from the Ba\u2019ath regime and they were joined to Duhok province until now.  In 2008 the KRG decided to create a new district (Qaza) centred on Bardarash.{{reference needed}}\n\n[[File:Bardarash mosque.jpg|thumb|One of the mosques of Bardarash]]\n\n==Etymology==\nBardarash means \"black stone\"; this is because its soil in general is black or, there is a destination south of the Bardarash is called (Shaxe-Rash, Black-Rocks) and it\u2019s said that people are used to live there before they transfer to current place.\n\n==Geography and population==\nBardarash district is located between two rivers which they are (Upper- Zab, Zey Badinan) and (Xazir) in the east the west, and in north has a border with Akre and south with Mosul and Hawler. According to an (UN-WFP) census in 1997 the population of Bardarash district was 51,713 people.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nBut now according to Bardarash Mayoralty, Bardarash now consists of three subjoined districts, which are Daratoo, Roviya, and Kalak, and 88 villages. The population of Bardarash town itself now is more than 26,800 .\nSub-districts joined to Bardarash are 1- Daratoo 2- Rovia 3- Kalak \n\n[[File:Bardarash traditional.jpg|thumb|A man from Bardarash wearing traditional clothes of the area]]\n\n==Social components==\nIn Bardarash district the Goran tribe is dominant and they are subdivided into several smaller tribes. Tribal mentality has its biggest effect on the people of Bardarash and as a result of this mentality, there are some problems. As mentioned before there are several other tribes live in Bardarash, most of them came in 1975 when they migrated because of the Ba\u2019ath toppled regime from Zumar, Atrush, Shexan, Rabee\u2019a and Mreba and they were forced to settle in (Kanilan) village. After that Bardarash people took them and they divided to villages and many of them still live in Bardarash.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Becoming a district==\n<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:District ceremony.jpg|thumb|The ceremony of becoming a District<ref name=\"Duhok governorate official website\">http://www.duhokgov.org/english/show.php?idd=105 Bardarash becomes a district], from(Duhok g.official website).</ref> <br /> ]]  -->\n\nThe ceremonies of turning Bardarash sub district into a district were performed in presence of Tamar Remezan, [[Dohuk Governorate|Duhok]] governor, the head of [[KDP]] branch (9), and a number of administrative and party officials and the dignitaries of the area. The mayor of Bardarash first gave a brief history of the sub district and the importance that KRG attached to the area after 1991, and he made it clear how important the decision to make Bardarash a district is. In his speech, the governor congratulated the people of the area and said that it is for the good of people that this decision was taken in order to give more attention to the area and promised to help improve the work of the administrative departments there. [[Mazin M. Saeed]], the mayor, promised to do his best to provide services to the people. It is worth mentioning that Bardarash became a sub district in 1890 and more than 75000 people live in. It has two sub district (Kalak and Rovia), and another subdistrict is expected (Darato).<ref name=\"Duhok governorate official website\">[http://www.duhokgov.org/english/show.php?idd=105 Bardarash becomes a district], from(Duhok governorate official website).</ref>\n\n==Bardarash Uprising==\nOn 12 March 1991 at 9 o\u2019clock in the morning, Bardarash people like other [[Kurdish people]] in other parts of [[Kurdistan]], started the uprising against Ba\u2019ath regime and became the Gate of Uprising in [[Badinan]], after that Akre and Duhok and [[Zaxo]] upraised against the regime and liberated. As we said before 1991 Bardarash and Akre were joined to Mosul province but after the uprising, Bardarash and [[Akre]] were only two towns that upraised against Ba\u2019ath Regime in [[Ninewa]] province and after that they joined to [[Dohuk Governorate|Duhok]] province and still managed by the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]].\n\n==Bardarash and The Battle of Gaugamela==\n\nDuring a workshop conducted by Salahadin University hosting an archeologist and a historian from the Greek Cyprus University, instructors and students of archeology department discussed for several hours the circumstances surrounding the battle. This resulted in pinpointing exactly where Gaugamela took place.\n\nMuhamad Abdullah Kakasoor, Dean of the College of Arts at University of Salahadin stated that the battle was previously thought to have occurred near the city of Erbil. \nA team from the Greek Cyprus University visited Erbil recently to discover the real location of the battle. After a more thorough local investigation, they came to the conclusion that the battlefield was situated in the triangle of Maqloob Mountain ? Tel Gomer Village and Bardarash. \nMr. Kakasoor said, after the delegation?s visit to the site, intensive excavations will be carried out.\n?The importance of this topic is that [[Gaugamela]] or sometimes called Erbela is an international historical occurrence, whoever reads the history of [[Alexander]] will come across the name Erbela which undoubtedly refers to the current city of [[Erbil]] (or Hawler). \nHe said that the Greek archeologists revealed that the real location of the battle is in Bardarash District rather than the place mentioned in Greek and Iranian historical sources. \n?The Greek delegation has reached a conclusion, depending on their study and ancient and contemporary Greek sources that the battle occurred in Bardarash District which is a wide area suitable to be used as a battlefield. So now the actual location of the battle is settled? he argued. \nThe battle is believed to be the first after which the West could dominate the East powers. According to the historical sources, [[Darius III|Darius]]'s army consisted of 100-200 thousand soldiers, but the technique [[Alexander]] used in the battle enabled him to win with fewer numbers of soldiers. \nThe Head of Archeology at Salahadin University stated during the workshop that he visited the site in Bardarash himself. \nAnd according to the scripts and documents that Greek Cyprus University professors revealed, the site of the battle is located 90&nbsp;km far away from the city of Erbil. \nIn addition, they say that Persian sources mention the mountain that?s now known as Maqloob which both armies passed by ahead of their arrival to Gomel River, Upper Zap and Xazir River, and both armies reached Tel Gomel (a village in Bardarash District) where there?s a wide plain of 10&nbsp;km long and 5\u20137&nbsp;km wide. He added that the area is very wide, so excavating and searching for military equipment of both armies can be challenging. \nHowever, modern detecting equipments can facilitate searching and finding some pieces of weapons such as spears, bows and arrows or whatever made of iron and used in the fight. He also stated that excavations haven?t started yet. \nAccording to archeologists who took part in the workshop, the outcome of this workshop will be presented to Salahadin University and [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]] Council of Ministers so that the location could be surveyed and excavated thoroughly and extensively, and finally turned into a very interesting archeological site in Kurdistan Region.<ref name=\"The Kurdish Globe\">[http://kurdishglobe.net/article/18EDF300EF8A0184B86ADF8FB69F6BC0/The-Location-of-the-Battle-of-Gaugamela-Discovered.html The Location of the Battle of Gaugamela Discovered] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132852/http://kurdishglobe.net/article/18EDF300EF8A0184B86ADF8FB69F6BC0/The-Location-of-the-Battle-of-Gaugamela-Discovered.html |date=April 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Iraqi Kurdistan]]\n[[Category:Dohuk Governorate]]\n[[Category:Kurdish settlements]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the places in Iran|Bardarash, Iran (disambiguation){{!}}Bardarash, Iran}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}\n{{original research|date=July 2011}}\n}}\n{{Coord|36|30|12.2|N|43|35|14|E|display=title}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name                   = Bardarash\n| native_name                     =\u0628\u06d5\u0631\u062f\u06d5\u0695\u06d5\u0634 <br> Berdere\u015f\n| image_skyline                   = Bardarash town.jpg\n| image_caption                   = View of town from Bardarash\n| pushpin_map                     = Iraq\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Iraq}}<br>{{flag|Kurdistan Region}}\n| subdivision_type2               = Province\n| subdivision_name2               = [[Dohuk Governorate]]\n| subdivision_type3               = district\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|36|30|12.2|N|43|35|14.0|E|region:IQ|display=inline}}\n}}\n\n'''Bardarash''' ({{lang-ku|Berdere\u015f ,\u0628\u06d5\u0631\u062f\u06d5\u0695\u06d5\u0634}})<ref>{{cite news |title=\u0633\u06d5\u0631\u06c6\u0643\u06cc \u067e\u06ce\u0634\u0648\u0648\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06d5\u06cc \u0648\u06d5\u0631\u0632\u0634\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u06d5\u0631\u062f\u06d5\u0695\u06d5\u0634 \u062f\u06d5\u062f\u0631\u06ce\u062a\u06d5 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u06af\u0627 |url=https://www.rudaw.net/sorani/kurdistan/02112019 |accessdate=21 December 2019 |work=R\u00fbdaw |language=ku}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Penaber\u00ean n\u00fb gehi\u015ftine Kampa Berdere\u015f behsa rew\u015f\u00ean xwe dikin |url=https://www.rebaznews.net/ku/node/3788 |accessdate=21 December 2019 |work=Rebaznews |language=ku}}</ref> is a town located in [[Kurdistan Region]], [[Dohuk Governorate]], 70&nbsp;km north of [[Erbil]] city and 32&nbsp;km north east of [[Mosul]].

At the time he resided in [[Manila]] with his uncle Father Mariano Borja, a priest assigned to the urban parish of Sampaloc.

According to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]], the establishment of the [[Philippine Independent Church]] or the [[Aglipayan Church]] was his major turning point, but Manalo remained uninterested since its doctrines were mainly Catholic.
