An acute observer of the continual change in the natural world, she took light and reflection, growth and decay, beaches and tides, pebbles and stones, clouds and shadows and manipulated them to capture a unique view of her surroundings. In addition to [[pen and ink]], [[pencil]], [[Oil painting|oils]], [[watercolours]], and [[pastels]], a series of commissions enabled her to employ [[egg tempera]] murals, [[architectural]] [[designs]], and [[Industry|industrial]] [[enamelling]] techniques. Irrespective of the media employed, it was with felt that she produced her most compelling and remarkable work. In the words of lifelong friend Duncan Smith: \"Cowern took an ancient craft, pushed it in thrilling new directions and gave us contemporary pieces of the highest order.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Obituary Notice by Duncan Smith, Cumberland News, 30 September 2005</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early days===\nJenny Cowern was born in [[Worcester]], [[England]], on 20 June 1943, the second daughter of artists Raymond Cowern [[Royal Academician|RA]] and Margaret (n\u00e9e Trotman). In 1959, Cowern enrolled at the [[Brighton College of Art]], where her father was [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Art]] faculty. During her time studying for her [[National Diploma (UK)|National Diploma]] in Design she produced 'Mother Cutting the Hedge' (1962) and 'East Street, Brighton' (1963). In 1963 she began studying at the [[Royal College of Art]], [[London]], where, amongst others, she studied under [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Carel Weight]], graduating from the Painting School in 1966 with the award of an ARCA ([[Alumnus of the Royal College of Art]]). At a tube station in London, she met the artist Raymond Higgs, who later became her lifelong partner.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===West Cumberland===\nIn 1965, Jenny won a David Murray travelling [[scholarship]] to paint [[landscape]], and used the opportunity to visit [[Cumbria]] where Raymond\u2019s mother owned a row of cottages at Langrigg, near [[Aspatria]]. One of these was empty and available for use, despite being derelict with neither water nor electricity, Cowern used it as a base for her scholarship. Following her graduation in 1966, Cowern moved to [[Sheffield]], where she took up a teaching post on the Sheffield College of Art\u2019s Foundation Course. In 1968, Higgs and Cowern moved to Langrigg and with no assistance and no prior skills eventually saved the three condemned cottages. She lived and had studios here for the rest of her life. While making the cottages habitable, Cowern took short-term teaching jobs at art colleges in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and began to take an artistic interest in the everyday building structures and materials that surrounded her non-art work. After working on renovating houses for eighteen months, domestic architecture became a dominant theme in her works. Several paintings of interiors followed; 'Doors and Windows' (1970), and 'Drawing on Walls' (1971/72) are prime examples of her thoughts during this period. In 1976, works including 'Media Ideas Matrix' and 'Weaving Felt Knit Matrix' set her on the path to exploring [[textiles]] as a creative medium.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 3\u20137</ref>\n\n===Sky felt hangings===\nIn 1979, Cowern visited a felt exhibition at [[Abbot Hall Art Gallery|Abbot Hall]], [[Kendal]] and bought the accompanying book, written by Mary Burkett, entitled 'The Art of the Feltmaker'. Although the exhibition consisted in the main of traditional articles: rugs, shepherd\u2019s cloaks, camel head-dresses, and hats, Cowern could see an alternative potential. \"Though beautiful, this was not the aspect which interested me. It was the mural scale, the freedom, unfussiness, oven crudeness and the directness which appealed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Crafts Magazine, No 51, July \u2013 August 1981</ref> The show and the book had a profound and stimulating effect upon the artist who having taught herself the necessary technicalities, realised the immense scope the medium had to offer. As Burkett recalls: \"Once she started to work with felt she was taken out of doors \u2013 before when making patterns she was inside, but having discovered the joys and possibilities of working outside, she stayed outside. She was working with nature.\"<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 page 33</ref> Cowern did not have to travel far for inspiration, the diversity of the skies over the Solway Firth exploded outside her front door, In 1981, she gave the following explanation to the readers of [[Crafts]] Magazine. \"My felt skies are a dialogue between a new medium and a new subject. The desire to work in the medium came first and the skies second. Excitement at looking at skies became foremost; their integration with felt became natural.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In 1980, she exhibited her huge Sky Felts, to wide acclaim, first at Abbot Hall and later at [[Tullie House]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. In 1981, the collection went on a two-year tour of galleries in [[Scotland]], with venues in the MacRoberts Centre in [[Stirling]]; the Artspace in [[Aberdeen]], the Crawford Gallery at [[St. Andrews University]], before crossing over to the [[Orkney Islands]], then returning to the Central Museum and Art Gallery, [[Dundee]]. Cordelia Oliver writing in Crafts Quarterly observed.\n\n:\"The medium is an unusual one, even exploratory. Jenny Cowern is a painter by training (and a good [[Drawing|draughtsman]], too, on the evidence of a single drawing in her exhibition in which the essence of a sky in movement is caught and pinned down in a dance of lines) who has found an outlet in the potential scale, and, as she herself says, \"the freedom, unfussiness, oven crudeness, and the directness\" of creating these works in felt. Her home is in Cumbria where the sky is omnipresent and always fascinating in its element flux \u2013 nature\u2019s theatre of wind and light and water vapour.\"<ref>Crafts Quarterly, Issue No 5, Summer 1982</ref>\n\n===Commissions===\nIn 1977, Cowern won a Northern Arts, [[Arts Council]] competition to design a [[mural]] for a [[multi-storey car park]] at [[Stockton on Tees]]. Using the structure of the existing brickwork she proposed shimmering screen which would have made a decorative mural, but Stockton Council this was never realised, and it remains a design. In 1990, she designed, again through Northern Arts, a mural on the wall behind the interchange platform of the [[Heworth railway station]], on the [[Gateshead]] to [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] line. Because they required a permanent construction, which was unbreakable, washable and [[vandalism|vandal]] proof, they specified an [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] design. With no previous knowledge of the media,<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 81\u201382</ref> Cowern created a 29 panel mural of [[vitreous enamel]], 3 metres high and 33 metres long. Its theme paid homage to the industries of the north-east of [[England]], past and present, depicting [[coalmining]], [[ship building]], [[textiles]], [[glass making]] and other related industries.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 90\u201391</ref> Cowern returned to the media of enamel six years later when she received a commission to design and construct a set of murals for the [[Accident and Emergency]] Department of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead]]. In 1991, she received a further commission to produce a Felt [[Triptych]] Wall Hanging, for a long corridor wall for the Elderly Mentally Ill. (E.M.I.) Department at Hastings Hospital, [[Hastings]], England.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 83\u201388</ref>\n\n===Continuous improvement===\nAfter the success of her Sky Felt hangings, Cowern began to expand and develop the media, taking inspiration from the natural elements found in her immediate surroundings. At heart, she was an [[abstract painter]], as she explained. \"I have often found the need to balance my observational work with completely abstract work, developing it alongside.\"<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 page 56</ref> Taking encouragement from her own garden she produced [[Hydrangea]], (1986) a felt later purchased by the [[Shipley Art Gallery]]. She would return to the subject years later, where, using first oils and then pastels she produced equally stunning but differing representations. Indeed, this flirtation with varying media became one of her many strengths; after choosing her subject she hopscotched between a variety of media, producing [[watercolours]], oils, pastels, pencil, enamel, tempera\u2019s etc. She interpreted the [[geological]] structure of a group of tide-washed pebbles; and captured the spectrum of light as it danced through her windows. In 1996 she received an award from the Northern Arts Board and Cumbria County Council, which allowed her to produce a body of work inspired by the [[Solway Coast]] on the Cumbrian side. Not satisfied with encapsulating the changing facets of the beach and the tide at [[Allonby]], she moved down the coast to sketch, paint and felt the sandstone rocks below the Roman Fort at [[Maryport]]. Then on to [[Workington]] to study the [[slag]] formed cliffs, with their giant boulders and rusting metal.<ref>Review of Sea and Rocks: shore-line of Cumbria. Sheridan Russell Gallery by Meike Dalal Laurenson, IFA</ref> The coast would demand her attention for a number of years, as she explored every aspect, endeavouring to improve and perfect what she had previously done.<ref>Crafts Magazine, Issue 155, November \u2013 December 1998</ref> After completing a commission to decorate a [[Summer House]] on the shore of [[Windermere]], Cowern continued with the theme and produced a body of work centred on her own [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], where she contrasted the wooden-glazed structure, the hanging [[vine]]s, and spectacular floral displays with decaying compost. For the remainder of her life she would continue with recurring themes, at [[Bassenthwaite]], Isel, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]], [[Bergen]]; and many more places and many more themes.\n\n===Death===\nCowern died on 31 July 2005 at the age of 62. She had established her stature as an artist, and with exhibitions in Hungary, Norway, Poland, [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and France her international reputation was confirmed. When people think of Cowern they have a tendency to think of Felt, but there was much more than Felt, as she herself acknowledged:\n:\"I firmly believe that drawing, painting and observation have contributed more to my work in felt than has the medium itself, or rather they have allowed me to continue with felt beyond the point where I would otherwise have left it, by suggesting avenues of inquiry. I am sure that all feltmakers of however long acquaintance know of the excitement of discovery and the beauty which the medium brings, so easily, and will agree that a balance is required between allowing the medium its head and making it do what is wanted. An argument against the use of felt is that it 'gives' of itself too much, and therefore if reliance on that 'gift' is too great. all work in felt becomes similar, banal. It must be made to behave, beautifully why not, but in a controlled way. It must be fed with ideas, not allowed to be fixed in its own past. Felt is a brilliant teacher; it tells us of colour mixing, it tells us of graduated colour, it tells us of collage, it shows us that development can if necessary take the form of destruction and reconstruction. They are valuable lessons, but too many of these things together can become a riot of decoration. What is needed is a reason for being, a simple statement.\"<ref name=cowern>[http://jennycowern.co.uk/home.asp Jenny Cowern, official website]</ref>\n\n==One-man show==\nRelating to art exhibitions, a one-person show, also known as a one-man show or a [[solo show (art exhibition)|solo show]], is an exhibition of the creative work of a single person.<ref name=cowern/>\n\n* 1980, [[Abbot Hall Art Gallery|Abbot Hall]] [[Kendal]], Paintings, Drawings and Felts\n* 1980, [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Paintings, Drawings and Felts\n* 1980 \u2013 85, Touring Exhibition, Sky Felts and studies, a growing exhibition\n* 1985, Scott Gallery, [[Lancaster University]], Sky Felts and New Felts\n* 1987, Abbot Hall, Kendal, Work on Paper, Work in Felt\n* 1988, [[Van Mildert College]], [[Durham, England|Durham]],\n* 1988, Lowes Court Gallery, [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]], Trees and Sky\n* 1988, Institute of Education, [[London]], Trees and Sky\n* 1989, [[Durham Light Infantry#DLI Museum|D.L.I.

An acute observer of the continual change in the natural world, she took light and reflection, growth and decay, beaches and tides, pebbles and stones, clouds and shadows and manipulated them to capture a unique view of her surroundings. In addition to [[pen and ink]], [[pencil]], [[Oil painting|oils]], [[watercolours]], and [[pastels]], a series of commissions enabled her to employ [[egg tempera]] murals, [[architectural]] [[designs]], and [[Industry|industrial]] [[enamelling]] techniques. Irrespective of the media employed, it was with felt that she produced her most compelling and remarkable work. In the words of lifelong friend Duncan Smith: \"Cowern took an ancient craft, pushed it in thrilling new directions and gave us contemporary pieces of the highest order.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Obituary Notice by Duncan Smith, Cumberland News, 30 September 2005</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early days===\nJenny Cowern was born in [[Worcester]], [[England]], on 20 June 1943, the second daughter of artists Raymond Cowern [[Royal Academician|RA]] and Margaret (n\u00e9e Trotman). In 1959, Cowern enrolled at the [[Brighton College of Art]], where her father was [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Art]] faculty. During her time studying for her [[National Diploma (UK)|National Diploma]] in Design she produced 'Mother Cutting the Hedge' (1962) and 'East Street, Brighton' (1963). In 1963 she began studying at the [[Royal College of Art]], [[London]], where, amongst others, she studied under [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Carel Weight]], graduating from the Painting School in 1966 with the award of an ARCA ([[Alumnus of the Royal College of Art]]). At a tube station in London, she met the artist Raymond Higgs, who later became her lifelong partner.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===West Cumberland===\nIn 1965, Jenny won a David Murray travelling [[scholarship]] to paint [[landscape]], and used the opportunity to visit [[Cumbria]] where Raymond\u2019s mother owned a row of cottages at Langrigg, near [[Aspatria]]. One of these was empty and available for use, despite being derelict with neither water nor electricity, Cowern used it as a base for her scholarship. Following her graduation in 1966, Cowern moved to [[Sheffield]], where she took up a teaching post on the Sheffield College of Art\u2019s Foundation Course. In 1968, Higgs and Cowern moved to Langrigg and with no assistance and no prior skills eventually saved the three condemned cottages. She lived and had studios here for the rest of her life. While making the cottages habitable, Cowern took short-term teaching jobs at art colleges in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and began to take an artistic interest in the everyday building structures and materials that surrounded her non-art work. After working on renovating houses for eighteen months, domestic architecture became a dominant theme in her works. Several paintings of interiors followed; 'Doors and Windows' (1970), and 'Drawing on Walls' (1971/72) are prime examples of her thoughts during this period. In 1976, works including 'Media Ideas Matrix' and 'Weaving Felt Knit Matrix' set her on the path to exploring [[textiles]] as a creative medium.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 3-7</ref>\n\n===Sky felt hangings===\nIn 1979, Cowern visited a felt exhibition at [[Abbot Hall Art Gallery|Abbot Hall]], [[Kendal]] and bought the accompanying book, written by Mary Burkett, entitled 'The Art of the Feltmaker'. Although the exhibition consisted in the main of traditional articles: rugs, shepherd\u2019s cloaks, camel head-dresses, and hats, Cowern could see an alternative potential. \"Though beautiful, this was not the aspect which interested me. It was the mural scale, the freedom, unfussiness, oven crudeness and the directness which appealed.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Crafts Magazine, No 51, July \u2013 August 1981</ref> The show and the book had a profound and stimulating effect upon the artist who having taught herself the necessary technicalities, realised the immense scope the medium had to offer. As Burkett recalls: \"Once she started to work with felt she was taken out of doors \u2013 before when making patterns she was inside, but having discovered the joys and possibilities of working outside, she stayed outside. She was working with nature.\"<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 page 33</ref> Cowern did not have to travel far for inspiration, the diversity of the skies over the Solway Firth exploded outside her front door, In 1981, she gave the following explanation to the readers of [[Crafts]] Magazine. \"My felt skies are a dialogue between a new medium and a new subject. The desire to work in the medium came first and the skies second. Excitement at looking at skies became foremost; their integration with felt became natural.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In 1980, she exhibited her huge Sky Felts, to wide acclaim, first at Abbot Hall and later at [[Tullie House]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. In 1981, the collection went on a two-year tour of galleries in [[Scotland]], with venues in the MacRoberts Centre in [[Stirling]]; the Artspace in [[Aberdeen]], the Crawford Gallery at [[St. Andrews University]], before crossing over to the [[Orkney Islands]], then returning to the Central Museum and Art Gallery, [[Dundee]]. Cordelia Oliver writing in Crafts Quarterly observed.\n\n:\"The medium is an unusual one, even exploratory. Jenny Cowern is a painter by training (and a good [[Drawing|draughtsman]], too, on the evidence of a single drawing in her exhibition in which the essence of a sky in movement is caught and pinned down in a dance of lines) who has found an outlet in the potential scale, and, as she herself says, \"the freedom, unfussiness, oven crudeness, and the directness\" of creating these works in felt. Her home is in Cumbria where the sky is omnipresent and always fascinating in its element flux - nature\u2019s theatre of wind and light and water vapour.\"<ref>Crafts Quarterly, Issue No 5, Summer 1982</ref>\n\n===Commissions===\nIn 1977, Cowern won a Northern Arts, [[Arts Council]] competition to design a [[mural]] for a [[multi-storey car park]] at [[Stockton on Tees]]. Using the structure of the existing brickwork she proposed shimmering screen which would have made a decorative mural, but Stockton Council this was never realised, and it remains a design. In 1990, she designed, again through Northern Arts, a mural on the wall behind the interchange platform of the [[Heworth railway station]], on the [[Gateshead]] to [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] line. Because they required a permanent construction, which was unbreakable, washable and [[vandalism|vandal]] proof, they specified an [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] design. With no previous knowledge of the media,<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 81-82</ref> Cowern created a 29 panel mural of [[vitreous enamel]], 3 metres high and 33 metres long. Its theme paid homage to the industries of the north-east of [[England]], past and present, depicting [[coalmining]], [[ship building]], [[textiles]], [[glass making]] and other related industries.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 90-91</ref> Cowern returned to the media of enamel six years later when she received a commission to design and construct a set of murals for the [[Accident and Emergency]] Department of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead]]. In 1991, she received a further commission to produce a Felt [[Triptych]] Wall Hanging, for a long corridor wall for the Elderly Mentally Ill. (E.M.I.) Department at Hastings Hospital, [[Hastings]], England.<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 pages 83-88</ref>\n\n===Continuous improvement===\nAfter the success of her Sky Felt hangings, Cowern began to expand and develop the media, taking inspiration from the natural elements found in her immediate surroundings. At heart, she was an [[abstract painter]], as she explained. \"I have often found the need to balance my observational work with completely abstract work, developing it alongside.\"<ref>Burkett and Rickerby, 2007 page 56</ref> Taking encouragement from her own garden she produced [[Hydrangea]], (1986) a felt later purchased by the [[Shipley Art Gallery]]. She would return to the subject years later, where, using first oils and then pastels she produced equally stunning but differing representations. Indeed, this flirtation with varying media became one of her many strengths; after choosing her subject she hopscotched between a variety of media, producing [[watercolours]], oils, pastels, pencil, enamel, tempera\u2019s etc. She interpreted the [[geological]] structure of a group of tide-washed pebbles; and captured the spectrum of light as it danced through her windows. In 1996 she received an award from the Northern Arts Board and Cumbria County Council, which allowed her to produce a body of work inspired by the [[Solway Coast]] on the Cumbrian side. Not satisfied with encapsulating the changing facets of the beach and the tide at [[Allonby]], she moved down the coast to sketch, paint and felt the sandstone rocks below the Roman Fort at [[Maryport]]. Then on to [[Workington]] to study the [[slag]] formed cliffs, with their giant boulders and rusting metal.<ref>Review of Sea and Rocks: shore-line of Cumbria. Sheridan Russell Gallery by Meike Dalal Laurenson, IFA</ref> The coast would demand her attention for a number of years, as she explored every aspect, endeavouring to improve and perfect what she had previously done.<ref>Crafts Magazine, Issue 155, November - December 1998</ref> After completing a commission to decorate a [[Summer House]] on the shore of [[Windermere]], Cowern continued with the theme and produced a body of work centred on her own [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], where she contrasted the wooden-glazed structure, the hanging [[vine]]s, and spectacular floral displays with decaying compost. For the remainder of her life she would continue with recurring themes, at [[Bassenthwaite]], Isel, the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]], [[Bergen]]; and many more places and many more themes.\n\n===Death===\nCowern died on 31 July 2005 at the age of 62. She had established her stature as an artist, and with exhibitions in Hungary, Norway, Poland, [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and France her international reputation was confirmed. When people think of Cowern they have a tendency to think of Felt, but there was much more than Felt, as she herself acknowledged:\n:\"I firmly believe that drawing, painting and observation have contributed more to my work in felt than has the medium itself, or rather they have allowed me to continue with felt beyond the point where I would otherwise have left it, by suggesting avenues of inquiry. I am sure that all feltmakers of however long acquaintance know of the excitement of discovery and the beauty which the medium brings, so easily, and will agree that a balance is required between allowing the medium its head and making it do what is wanted. An argument against the use of felt is that it 'gives' of itself too much, and therefore if reliance on that 'gift' is too great. all work in felt becomes similar, banal. It must be made to behave, beautifully why not, but in a controlled way. It must be fed with ideas, not allowed to be fixed in its own past. Felt is a brilliant teacher; it tells us of colour mixing, it tells us of graduated colour, it tells us of collage, it shows us that development can if necessary take the form of destruction and reconstruction. They are valuable lessons, but too many of these things together can become a riot of decoration. What is needed is a reason for being, a simple statement.\"<ref name=cowern>[http://jennycowern.co.uk/home.asp Jenny Cowern, official website]</ref>\n\n==One-man show==\nRelating to art exhibitions, a one-person show, also known as a one-man show or a [[solo show (art exhibition)|solo show]], is an exhibition of the creative work of a single person.<ref name=cowern/>\n\n* 1980, [[Abbot Hall Art Gallery|Abbot Hall]] [[Kendal]], Paintings, Drawings and Felts\n* 1980, [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Paintings, Drawings and Felts\n* 1980 \u2013 85, Touring Exhibition, Sky Felts and studies, a growing exhibition\n* 1985, Scott Gallery, [[Lancaster University]], Sky Felts and New Felts\n* 1987, Abbot Hall, Kendal, Work on Paper, Work in Felt\n* 1988, [[Van Mildert College]], [[Durham, England|Durham]],\n* 1988, Lowes Court Gallery, [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]], Trees and Sky\n* 1988, Institute of Education, [[London]], Trees and Sky\n* 1989, [[Durham Light Infantry#DLI Museum|D.L.I.

Understood to be a portrait of Varvara Lopukhina.]]\n'''Varvara Aleksandrovna Bakhmeteva''' (\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0301\u0442\u0435\u0432\u0430; 1815\u20131851), birth name '''Varvara Alexandrovna Lopukhina''', was a Russian noblewoman who was the beloved and tragic muse of the great [[Romantic literature|Romantic]] poet [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Her first name, Varvara (\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430) \u2013 which is stressed on the second syllable \u2013 may be translated as \"Barbara\".\n\n==Biography==\nBorn into the ancient noble [[Lopukhin family]], Varvara Lopukhina was the seventh of eight children. She and her brother Alexei and sister Maria were close friends of Mikhail Lermontov from 1828, when Lermontov came to Moscow for his secondary school education \u2013 and in time Varvara and Mikhail fell in love. At the age of 18, Lermontov wrote these lines to Lopukhin:\n\n{{quote|text=<poem>But all her movements,\nSmile, speech, and features,\nSo full of life and inspiration,\nSo full of wonderful simplicity;\nYet the voice of the soul comes through,\nHow I shall remember these incomparable days...</poem>}}\n\nAccording to recollections of the relatives of the poet, Lermontov retained this love for Lopukhina until his death. But the Lopukhin family opposed their marriage, particularly Varvara's father, Aleksandr Lopukhin, and her sister and Lermontov's friend, Mariya.\n\nIn 1835 Varvara Lopukhina married Nikolay Fyodorovich Bakhmetev, a wealthy landowner and an [[Active State Councillor]]. Nikolay was then 37 and Varvara 20. According to Lermontov's second cousin Akim Shan-Girey, at the news of Lopukhina's impending marriage Lermontov's \"face changed and grew pale\".\n\nLermontov found difficulty in accepting Varvara's new surname. Sending her a new version of \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\" (a long poem featuring some of the most resonant lines in the Russian language, which he rewrote several times), he several times crossed out the initials \u0412\u0410\u0411 and wrote instead \u0412\u0410\u041b in the dedication sent to the copyist.\n\nLermontov, tormented by jealousy, alluded to Nikolay Bakhmetev several times in his writing with sardonic humor as a greybeard and cuckold. However, his stinging attacks on Bakhmetev were also transferred to his wife:\n{{quote|text=As the dessert champagne was served, Pechorin, raising his glass, turned to the princess: \"As I did not have the good fortune to be at your wedding, let me congratulate you now\". She looked at him with surprise and said nothing. But a secret anguish cast a fleeting shadow across her face, and the water glass in her hand was trembling... Pechorin saw it all, and something akin to remorse crept into his chest: was he the source of her torment? And for what? And what pleasure did he find in petty revenge?... He thought this to himself, but could find no answer.}}\nBakhmetev was also jealous and forbade his wife to speak of Lermontov, and made every effort to destroy her correspondence with the poet, so that the main source of information about their relationship after marriage is the poet's correspondence with Varvara's sister, Mariya Lopukhina.\n\n[[File:Paintings by Mikhail Lermontov, 1832-34, Lopukhina.jpg|thumb|120px|Sketch of Varvara Lopukhina, by Lermontov]]\nIn 1839, to save all her materials associated with Lermontov from destruction, Varvara Bakhmeteva gave them to her friend Aleksandra Vereshchagina when she was at a European resort. Much of this material, drawings and writing by Lermontov, were passed to Vereshchagina's descendants in Russia. According to the literary critic [[Irakly Andronikov]], though, \"Not all the Vereshchagina materials have come to light\".\n\nVarvara Bakhmeteva was never happy or even well after her marriage. Her last meeting with Lermontov in 1838 was described thus by Shan-Girey:<ref>{{cite journal\n|author       = \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u042e.\n|script-title = ru:\u041b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430.\n|url          = http://www.pereplet.ru:18000/podiem/n12-01/Lerm1.shtml\n|newspaper    = \u041f\u043e\u0434\u044a\u0435\u043c\n|year         = 2001\n|issue        = 12\n|language     = Russian\n}} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n{{quote|text = My God, how painfully my heart ached at her appearance! Pale, thin, and no trace of the old Varvara. Only her eyes retained their luster, and they were as affectionate as ever.}}\n\nVarvara and Nikolay Bakhmetev had a daughter, Olga (married name Olga Bazylevska). In 1838 Lermontov, returned from his exile in the Caucasus, met with mother and child. According to [[Pavel Viskovatov]], Lermontov's poem \"The Child\" is about this meeting. Reacting to the changed appearance of his beloved, Lermontov wrote\n{{quote|text = <poem>...Alas! The years fly;\nSuffering before her time, she is changed.\nBut the true dream, the true image,\nIs kept in my heart.</poem>}}\nVarvara Bakhmeteva had repeatedly traveled with her husband abroad for treatment, but after Lermontov's death in an 1841 duel, her condition deteriorated. In the autumn of 1841 her sister Mariya wrote:\n{{quote|text=The latest news about my sister Varvara is truly sad. She is again ill, her nerves are so upset that she was forced to spend two weeks in bed. Too weak even to eat. Her husband asked her to go to Moscow - she refuses to go abroad - but she refused and stated emphatically that she no longer wishes to be treated. Maybe I'm wrong, but I attribute this disorder to the death of Mikhail.}}\n\nVarvara Bakhmeteva died on 9 September 1851, at the age of 36. She was buried in the small cathedral of the [[Donskoy Monastery]]. Her husband survived her by more than thirty years. Nikolay Fyodorovich Bakhmetev died on 3 March 1884, and was buried beside his wife.\n\n==Varvara Lopukhina in the works of Lermontov==\n[[File:Paintings by Mikhail Lermontov, 1835.jpg|thumb|Varvara Bakhmeteva. Painting by Lermontov in 1835, the year of her marriage.]]\nThe figure of Varvara Aleksandrovna is reflected many times in Lermontov's work. He dedicated some works to her directly, and she served as the prototype of many of the poet's characters, such as in verses 254\u2013260 of the poem \"Sashka\". And he painted and drew many portraits of her also.\n\nThe third edition of his famous poem \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\" was dedicated to Varvara Lopukhina; the sixth and seventh he also sent to her with a dedication.\n\nLermontov's play \"Two Brothers\", written after Varvara's marriage, highlights the mercantile aspects of contemporary marriage, a financial relationship of with no deep feelings between the spouses.\n\nA similar theme \u2013 a strong sense of connection between two characters before the heroine's marriage to another, but the heroine's love not quenched but rather strengthened by the separation \u2013 appears in the poet's later works \"[[Princess Ligovskaya]]\" and \"[[A Hero of Our Time]]\". Of this autobiographical work Lermontov wrote \"...I'm writing the fourth act of the new drama, taken from events that happened to me in Moscow.\"\n\nThe name Varvara Lopukhina is closely linked to Lermontov's poem addressed to Yekaterina Bykhovets: \"No, it is not you whom I love so ardently\". According to Bykhovets's memoirs:\n{{quote|text = He was passionately in love with B. A. Bakhmetev... I think I drew his attention because he found in me her likeness, and his favorite topic of conversation was her.}}\nAutobiographical passages occurred in \"A Hero of Our Time\".

Her first name, Varvara (\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430) \u2013 which is stressed on the second syllable \u2013 may be translated as \"Barbara\".\n\n==Biography==\nBorn into the ancient noble [[Lopukhin family]], Varvara Lopukhina was the seventh of eight children. She and her brother Alexei and sister Maria were close friends of Mikhail Lermontov from 1828, when Lermontov came to Moscow for his secondary school education \u2013 and in time Varvara and Mikhail fell in love. At the age of 18, Lermontov wrote these lines to Lopukhin:\n\n{{quote|text=<poem>But all her movements,\nSmile, speech, and features,\nSo full of life and inspiration,\nSo full of wonderful simplicity;\nYet the voice of the soul comes through,\nHow I shall remember these incomparable days...</poem>}}\n\nAccording to recollections of the relatives of the poet, Lermontov retained this love for Lopukhina until his death. But the Lopukhin family opposed their marriage, particularly Varvara's father, Aleksandr Lopukhin, and her sister and Lermontov's friend, Mariya.\n\nIn 1835 Varvara Lopukhina married Nikolay Fyodorovich Bakhmetev, a wealthy landowner and an [[Active State Councillor]]. Nikolay was then 37 and Varvara 20. According to Lermontov's second cousin Akim Shan-Girey, at the news of Lopukhina's impending marriage Lermontov's \"face changed and grew pale\".\n\nLermontov found difficulty in accepting Varvara's new surname. Sending her a new version of \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\" (a long poem featuring some of the most resonant lines in the Russian language, which he rewrote several times), he several times crossed out the initials \u0412\u0410\u0411 and wrote instead \u0412\u0410\u041b in the dedication sent to the copyist.\n\nLermontov, tormented by jealousy, alluded to Nikolay Bakhmetev several times in his writing with sardonic humor as a greybeard and cuckold. However, his stinging attacks on Bakhmetev were also transferred to his wife:\n{{quote|text=As the dessert champagne was served, Pechorin, raising his glass, turned to the princess: \"As I did not have the good fortune to be at your wedding, let me congratulate you now\". She looked at him with surprise and said nothing. But a secret anguish cast a fleeting shadow across her face, and the water glass in her hand was trembling... Pechorin saw it all, and something akin to remorse crept into his chest: was he the source of her torment? And for what? And what pleasure did he find in petty revenge?... He thought this to himself, but could find no answer.}}\nBakhmetev was also jealous and forbade his wife to speak of Lermontov, and made every effort to destroy her correspondence with the poet, so that the main source of information about their relationship after marriage is the poet's correspondence with Varvara's sister, Mariya Lopukhina.\n\n[[File:Paintings by Mikhail Lermontov, 1832-34, Lopukhina.jpg|thumb|120px|Sketch of Varvara Lopukhina, by Lermontov]]\nIn 1839, to save all her materials associated with Lermontov from destruction, Varvara Bakhmeteva gave them to her friend Aleksandra Vereshchagina when she was at a European resort. Much of this material, drawings and writing by Lermontov, were passed to Vereshchagina's descendants in Russia. According to the literary critic [[Irakly Andronikov]], though, \"Not all the Vereshchagina materials have come to light\".\n\nVarvara Bakhmeteva was never happy or even well after her marriage. Her last meeting with Lermontov in 1838 was described thus by Shan-Girey:<ref>{{cite journal\n|author       = \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u042e.\n|script-title = ru:\u041b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430.\n|url          = http://www.pereplet.ru:18000/podiem/n12-01/Lerm1.shtml\n|newspaper    = \u041f\u043e\u0434\u044a\u0435\u043c\n|year         = 2001\n|issue        = 12\n|language     = Russian\n}} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n{{quote|text = My God, how painfully my heart ached at her appearance!

In 1838 Lermontov, returned from his exile in the Caucasus, met with mother and child. According to [[Pavel Viskovatov]], Lermontov's poem \"The Child\" is about this meeting. Reacting to the changed appearance of his beloved, Lermontov wrote\n{{quote|text = <poem>...Alas! The years fly;\nSuffering before her time, she is changed.\nBut the true dream, the true image,\nIs kept in my heart.</poem>}}\nVarvara Bakhmeteva had repeatedly traveled with her husband abroad for treatment, but after Lermontov's death in an 1841 duel, her condition deteriorated. In the autumn of 1841 her sister Mariya wrote:\n{{quote|text=The latest news about my sister Varvara is truly sad.

Her husband asked her to go to Moscow - she refuses to go abroad - but she refused and stated emphatically that she no longer wishes to be treated. Maybe I'm wrong, but I attribute this disorder to the death of Mikhail.}}\n\nVarvara Bakhmeteva died on 9 September 1851, at the age of 36. She was buried in the small cathedral of the [[Donskoy Monastery]]. Her husband survived her by more than thirty years. Nikolay Fyodorovich Bakhmetev died on 3 March 1884, and was buried beside his wife.\n\n==Varvara Lopukhina in the works of Lermontov==\n[[File:Paintings by Mikhail Lermontov, 1835.jpg|thumb|Varvara Bakhmeteva.

He dedicated some works to her directly, and she served as the prototype of many of the poet's characters, such as in verses 254\u2013260 of the poem \"Sashka\". And he painted and drew many portraits of her also.\n\nThe third edition of his famous poem \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\" was dedicated to Varvara Lopukhina; the sixth and seventh he also sent to her with a dedication.\n\nLermontov's play \"Two Brothers\", written after Varvara's marriage, highlights the mercantile aspects of contemporary marriage, a financial relationship of with no deep feelings between the spouses.\n\nA similar theme \u2013 a strong sense of connection between two characters before the heroine's marriage to another, but the heroine's love not quenched but rather strengthened by the separation \u2013 appears in the poet's later works \"[[Princess Ligovskaya]]\" and \"[[A Hero of Our Time]]\". Of this autobiographical work Lermontov wrote \"...I'm writing the fourth act of the new drama, taken from events that happened to me in Moscow.\"\n\nThe name Varvara Lopukhina is closely linked to Lermontov's poem addressed to Yekaterina Bykhovets: \"No, it is not you whom I love so ardently\". According to Bykhovets's memoirs:\n{{quote|text = He was passionately in love with B. A. Bakhmetev... I think I drew his attention because he found in me her likeness, and his favorite topic of conversation was her.}}\nAutobiographical passages occurred in \"A Hero of Our Time\". According to Lermontov's first biographer, Pavel Viskovatov, everyone who read the chapter \"Princess Mary\" recognized the Bakhmetevs in the characters of Faith and her husband.<ref>{{cite book\n|last         = Viskovatov\n|first        = Paul\n|script-title = ru:\u041c. \u042e. \u041b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \n|trans-title  = M.
