They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio, television and in films. Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. \n\nMartin established himself as a notable singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the [[Great American Songbook]]. He became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], who together formed the [[Rat Pack]].\n\nStarting in 1964, Martin was the host of the television variety program ''[[Dean Martin Show|The Dean Martin Show]]'', which centred on Martin's singing talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanour. From 1974 to 1984 he was [[roastmaster]] on the popular ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', which drew notable celebrities, comedians and politicians.\n\nThroughout his career, Martin performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions. His relaxed, warbling, [[Crooner|crooning]] voice earned him dozens of hit singles, including his signature songs \"[[Memories Are Made of This]]\", \"[[That's Amore]]\", \"[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]\", \"[[You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You]]\", \"[[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)|Sway]]\", \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\" and \"[[Volare (song)|Volare]]\".\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Dean Martin Mural in Steubenville.jpg|left|thumb|Mural of Dean Martin in Steubenville, Ohio]]\nMartin was born '''Dino Paul Crocetti''' on June 7, 1917, in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], the son of Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894\u20131967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (''n\u00e9e'' Barra; 1899\u20131966). His parents were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from [[Montesilvano|Montesilvano, Abruzzo]], and his mother's origins are also believed to be from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916\u20131968).<ref>1920 Census [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDBB-9M7] FamilySearch</ref> His first language was Italian and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five.

At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself \"Dino Martini\" (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor [[Nino Martini]]). He got his break working for the [[Ernie McKay Orchestra]]. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills of the [[Mills Brothers]] and [[Perry Como]].<ref name=\"bio\" /> In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader [[Sammy Watkins (musician)|Sammy Watkins]], who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.\n\nIn October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Anne McDonald in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and the couple had an apartment in [[Cleveland Heights]] for a while. They eventually had four children before the marriage ended in 1949. Martin worked for various bands throughout the early 1940s, mostly on looks and personality until he developed his own singing style. He flopped at the Riobamba nightclub in New York, when he followed [[Frank Sinatra]] in 1943.<ref>\"Two New to Biz Take Over Riobamba.\" ''The Billboard'', New York, New York, September 16, 1944, page 24.

He met comic [[Jerry Lewis]] at the Glass Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. [[Martin and Lewis]] formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material.<ref>Ambalal, Monica. The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition. University of Michigan. Oxford University Press, Inc. 2013</ref> Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls.\n\nThey did slapstick, reeled off old [[vaudeville]] jokes, and did whatever else popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''The Toast Of The Town'') on June 20, 1948, with composers [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers [[Norman Lear]] and Ed Simmons to write their bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/|title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer|first=Tim|last=Gray|date=30 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref> With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12-IA1&dq=%22Martin+and+Lewis%22+radio+intitle:Billboard#v=onepage&q=%22Martin+and+Lewis%22+radio+intitle:Billboard|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=31 October 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nA [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio series]] began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as comedy relief for the movie ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]''. Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions.\n\nThey also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In ''Dean & Me'', Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Lewis|Kaplan|2005|p=223}} He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was \"nothing to me but a dollar sign\". The act broke up in 1956, ten years to the day from the first teaming.\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Dean Martin portrait (from Ada trailer).jpg|thumb|Martin in the film ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'' (1961)]]\nMartin's first solo film, ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), was a box-office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with [[rock and roll]] to the fore, the era of the pop [[crooner]] was waning. Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), his part would be with [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. [[Tony Randall]] already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records. Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback. Martin starred alongside [[Frank Sinatra]] for the first time in the [[Vincente Minnelli]] drama, ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'' (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and also starring [[John Wayne]] and singer [[Ricky Nelson]]. He teamed again with Wayne in ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the [[Judy Holliday]] stage musical comedy ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]''. He won a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'', and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, ''[[Toys in the Attic (1963 film)|Toys in the Attic]]'', opposite [[Geraldine Page]], as well as in 1970's drama ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', a huge box-office success.\n\nSinatra and he teamed up for several more movies, the crime caper ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', the musical ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'', and the Western comedies ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' and ''[[4 for Texas]]'', often with their Rat Pack pals such as [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]], as well as a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]''. Martin also co-starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in a number of films, including ''Some Came Running'', ''[[Artists and Models]]'', ''[[Career (1959 film)|Career]]'', ''[[All in a Night's Work (film)|All in a Night's Work]]'', and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' He played a satiric variation of his own womanizing persona as Las Vegas singer \"Dino\" in [[Billy Wilder]]'s comedy ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]'' (1964) with [[Kim Novak]], and he poked fun at his image in films such as the ''[[Matt Helm]]'' [[spy]] [[parody|spoofs]] of the 1960s, in which he was a co-producer. In the third Matt Helm film ''[[The Ambushers (film)|The Ambushers]]'' (1967), Helm, about to be executed, receives a last cigarette and tells the provider, \"I'll remember you from the great beyond,\" continuing ''[[sotto voce]]'', \"somewhere around Steubenville, I hope.\"\n[[File:Dean Martin - Rio Bravo 1959.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'']]\nAs a singer, Martin copied the styles of Harry Mills (of the [[Mills Brothers]]), [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Perry Como]] until he developed his own and could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like Sinatra, he could not read music, but he recorded more than 100 albums and 600 songs. His signature tune, \"[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]\", knocked [[the Beatles]]' \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" off number one in the United States in 1964. This was followed by \"The Door is Still Open to My Heart\", which reached number six that year. [[Elvis Presley]] was said to have been a fan of  Martin, and patterned his performance of \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\" after Martin's style. Martin, like Elvis, was influenced by [[country music]]. By 1965, some of Martin's albums, such as ''[[Dean \"Tex\" Martin Rides Again]]'', ''[[Houston (album)|Houston]],'' ''[[Welcome to My World (Dean Martin album)|Welcome to My World]]'', and ''[[Gentle on My Mind (Dean Martin album)|Gentle on My Mind]]'', were composed of country and western songs by artists such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[Buck Owens]]. Martin often hosted country performers on his TV show and was named \"Man Of the Year\" by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1966. The final album of his recording career was 1983's ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]''.\n\nThe image of Martin as a Vegas entertainer in a tuxedo has been an enduring one. \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\", a song Martin performed in ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'', did not become a hit at the time, but has enjoyed a revival in the media and pop culture. For three decades, Martin was among the most popular acts in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Martin sang and was one of the smoothest comics in the business, benefiting from the decade of comedy with Lewis. Martin's daughter, Gail, also sang in Vegas and on many TV shows including his, co-hosting his summer replacement series on NBC. Daughter [[Deana Martin]] continues to perform, as did youngest son [[Ricci Martin]] until his death in August 2016. Eldest son Craig was a producer on Martin's television show and daughter Claudia was an actress in films such as ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]''. Though often thought of as a ladies' man, Martin spent a lot of time with his family; as second wife Jeanne put it, prior to the couple's divorce, \"He was home every night for dinner.\"\n\n===Rat Pack===\n{{Main|Rat Pack}}\n\nAs Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends [[Joey Bishop]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] formed the [[Rat Pack]], so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack centered on [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]]).\n\nThe Rat Pack was legendary for its [[Las Vegas Strip]] performances. For example, the marquee at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] might read DEAN MARTIN\u2014MAYBE FRANK\u2014MAYBE SAMMY. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers.<ref name=\"FRANKSINATRA-NANCY\">{{cite book|last=Sinatra|first=Nancy|title=Frank Sinatra: An American Legend|year=1998|publisher=Readers Digest Assn|isbn=978-0-7621-0134-4|page=156}}</ref> Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the [[George Clooney]]/[[Brad Pitt]] \"[[Ocean's Trilogy]].\"\n\n===''The Dean Martin Show''===\n[[File:Dean Martin Florence Henderson 1958.JPG|thumb|right|Martin and [[Florence Henderson]] in ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1968)]]\nIn 1965, Martin launched his weekly [[NBC]] comedy-variety series, ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy]] in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk [[crooner]], hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]]. During an interview on the British TV documentary ''Wine, Women and Song'', aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend [[Greg Garrison]], made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by [[NBCUniversal]].\n\nDespite Martin's reputation as a drinker \u2013 perpetuated via his vanity license plate \"DRUNKY\" \u2013 his alcohol use was quite disciplined.<ref>[[Richard Metzger|Metzger, Richard]] (July 8, 2011), [http://www.dangerousminds.net/index.php/comments/richard_metzger_the_time_i_met_dean_martin/ \"Richard Metzger: The time I met Dean Martin\"], Dangerous Minds, retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2019}} He was often the first to call it a night, and when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his wife and children.{{cn|date=September 2019}} He borrowed the lovable-drunk [[shtick]] from [[Joe E. Lewis]], but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Howard Hawks's ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' led to unsubstantiated claims of [[alcoholism]]. Martin starred in and co-produced four [[Matt Helm]] [[superspy]] comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of [[Westerns]]. By the early 1970s, ''The Dean Martin Show'' was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line golf balls and the [[Dean Martin Tucson Open]] was an event on golf's [[PGA Tour]] from 1972\u201375. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nNow comfortable financially, Martin began reducing his schedule. The final (1973\u20131974) season of his variety show was retooled into one of celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]], requiring less involvement. In the roasts, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of a variety of popular entertainment, athletic, and political figures. After the show's cancellation, NBC continued to air ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' as a series of TV specials through 1984.\n\n===Later career===\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for [[Reprise Records]]. Martin recorded his final Reprise album, ''[[Once in a While (Dean Martin album)|Once in a While]]'' in 1974, which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made  for [[Warner Bros. Records]]. ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]'' was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song\", which was recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, \"L.A. Is My Home\"/\"Drinking Champagne\", came in 1985. The 1974 film drama ''[[Mr. Ricco]]'' marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer. He played a featured role in the 1981 comedy ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its [[Cannonball Run II|sequel]], both starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nIn 1972, he filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He joined the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night of December 23, 1973, and his contract required him to star in a film (''Mr. Ricco '') for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin was 55 when he married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to [[Gail Renshaw]], [[Miss World]]\u2013U.S.A. 1969. Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.\n\nHe also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon'' in September 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage. As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience gave the two a [[standing ovation]] and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \"So, you working?\" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing  \"at the 'Meggum'\" (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, in 1989, on Martin's 72nd birthday.<ref name=Talevski>{{cite book|last=Talevski|first=Nick|title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84609-091-2|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and family==\nMartin was married three times. His first wife was Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 \u2013 July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Martin and McDonald married in 1941 and had four children:\n\n* Craig Martin (born 1942).\n* Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 \u2013 February 16, 2001).\n* Gail Martin (born 1945)\n* [[Deana Martin]] (born 1948).\n\nMartin and McDonald divorced in 1949 and Dean gained custody of their children. Betty lived out her life in relative obscurity in San Francisco, California.\n\nMartin's second wife was Dorothy Jean \"Jeanne\" Biegger (March 27, 1927 \u2013 August 24, 2016), a former [[Orange Bowl]] queen from [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949\u20131973) and produced three children: \n* [[Dean Paul Martin]] (November 17, 1951 \u2013 March 21, 1987).\n* [[Ricci Martin]] (September 20, 1953 \u2013 August 3, 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/music/people-news/ricci-martin-dead-musician-son-dean-martin-dies-1201832100/|title=Ricci Martin, Musician and Son of Dean Martin, Dies at 62|publisher=Variety|website=variety.com|date=6 August 2016|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref> \n* Gina Martin (born 1956).\n\nMartin's third marriage, to Catherine Hawn, lasted three years before Martin initiated divorce proceedings.

He also had a minor hit single with \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\" and made his first music video, which appeared on [[MTV]]. The video was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (formerly Dino of the 1960s \"[[teenybopper|teeny-bopper]]\" rock group [[Dino, Desi & Billy]]), died when his [[F-4 Phantom II]] jet fighter crashed while flying with the [[California Air National Guard]]. Martin's grief over his son's death left him depressed and demoralized. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.\n\nMartin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra's insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally's Hotel in 1990. There he had his final reunion with Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former [[Rat Pack]] members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr's 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, he congratulated Sinatra on his 75th birthday special.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Dean Martin Grave.JPG|thumb|upright=1|Crypt of Dean Martin, at [[Westwood Memorial Park]]]]\nMartin, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993, and was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it.

Road signs bearing an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear. In 2005, [[Clark County, Nevada]], renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in [[Rancho Mirage, California]].

One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed \"The King of Cool\" for his seemingly effortless charisma and self-assurance.<ref>{{cite web|author=mike says|url=http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/celebrities/dean-martins-diva-daughter-elvis-called-dad-the-king-cool/|title=Dean Martin's Diva Daughter: Elvis Called My Dad 'The King of Cool'|publisher=Blog.blogtalkradio.com|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245966#survey \"Dean Martin 'just a golfer' to his kids\"], thestar.com</ref>\n\nMartin gained his career breakthrough together with fellow comedian [[Jerry Lewis]], billed as [[Martin & Lewis]], in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio, television and in films. Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. \n\nMartin established himself as a notable singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the [[Great American Songbook]]. He became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], who together formed the [[Rat Pack]].\n\nStarting in 1964, Martin was the host of the television variety program ''[[Dean Martin Show|The Dean Martin Show]]'', which centred on Martin's singing talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanour. From 1974 to 1984 he was [[roastmaster]] on the popular ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', which drew notable celebrities, comedians and politicians.\n\nThroughout his career, Martin performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions. His relaxed, warbling, [[Crooner|crooning]] voice earned him dozens of hit singles, including his signature songs \"[[Memories Are Made of This]]\", \"[[That's Amore]]\", \"[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]\", \"[[You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You]]\", \"[[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)|Sway]]\", \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\" and \"[[Volare (song)|Volare]]\".\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Dean Martin Mural in Steubenville.jpg|left|thumb|Mural of Dean Martin in Steubenville, Ohio]]\nMartin was born '''Dino Paul Crocetti''' on June 7, 1917, in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], the son of Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894\u20131967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (''n\u00e9e'' Barra; 1899\u20131966). His parents were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from [[Montesilvano|Montesilvano, Abruzzo]], and his mother's origins are also believed to be from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916\u20131968).<ref>1920 Census [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDBB-9M7] FamilySearch</ref> His first language was Italian and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his [[broken English]]. As a teenager, he played the drums as a hobby. He dropped out of [[Steubenville High School]] in the tenth grade because he thought he was smarter than his teachers.<ref name=HOLLYWOODSONGSTERS>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert|title=Hollywood Songsters: Singers Who ACT and Actors Who Sing: A Biographical Dictionary Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94333-8|page=533}}</ref> He [[Rum-running|bootlegged liquor]], worked in a steel mill, served as a [[croupier]] at a [[speakeasy]] and a [[blackjack]] dealer, and was a welterweight boxer.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deanmartin.com/bio/|website=The Official Dean Martin site|title=Dean Martin Bio|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt 15, he was a boxer who billed himself as \"Kid Crochet\". His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a bruised body. Of his 12 bouts, he said that he \"won all but 11\".{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=57}} For a time, he shared a New York City apartment with [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], who was also starting in show business and had little money. The two reportedly charged people to watch them bare-knuckle box each other in their apartment, fighting until one was knocked out. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-scoop.com/show_boxer.php?boxer_ID=11280 |title=Dean Martin Amateur Boxing Record|publisher=Boxing-Scoop.com|date=1917-06-07|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> Martin gave up boxing to work as a [[roulette]] stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop, where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself \"Dino Martini\" (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor [[Nino Martini]]). He got his break working for the [[Ernie McKay Orchestra]]. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills of the [[Mills Brothers]] and [[Perry Como]].<ref name=\"bio\" /> In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader [[Sammy Watkins (musician)|Sammy Watkins]], who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.\n\nIn October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Anne McDonald in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and the couple had an apartment in [[Cleveland Heights]] for a while. They eventually had four children before the marriage ended in 1949. Martin worked for various bands throughout the early 1940s, mostly on looks and personality until he developed his own singing style. He flopped at the Riobamba nightclub in New York, when he followed [[Frank Sinatra]] in 1943.<ref>\"Two New to Biz Take Over Riobamba.\" ''The Billboard'', New York, New York, September 16, 1944, page 24.

He met comic [[Jerry Lewis]] at the Glass Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. [[Martin and Lewis]] formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material.<ref>Ambalal, Monica. The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition. University of Michigan. Oxford University Press, Inc. 2013</ref> Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls.\n\nThey did slapstick, reeled off old [[vaudeville]] jokes, and did whatever else popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''The Toast Of The Town'') on June 20, 1948, with composers [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers [[Norman Lear]] and Ed Simmons to write their bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/|title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer|first=Tim|last=Gray|date=30 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref> With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12-IA1&dq=%22Martin+and+Lewis%22+radio+intitle:Billboard#v=onepage&q=%22Martin+and+Lewis%22+radio+intitle:Billboard|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=31 October 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nA [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio series]] began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as comedy relief for the movie ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]''. Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions.\n\nThey also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In ''Dean & Me'', Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Lewis|Kaplan|2005|p=223}} He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was \"nothing to me but a dollar sign\". The act broke up in 1956, ten years to the day from the first teaming.\n\n===Solo career===\n[[File:Dean Martin portrait (from Ada trailer).jpg|thumb|Martin in the film ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'' (1961)]]\nMartin's first solo film, ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), was a box-office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with [[rock and roll]] to the fore, the era of the pop [[crooner]] was waning. Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), his part would be with [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. [[Tony Randall]] already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records. Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback. Martin starred alongside [[Frank Sinatra]] for the first time in the [[Vincente Minnelli]] drama, ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'' (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and also starring [[John Wayne]] and singer [[Ricky Nelson]]. He teamed again with Wayne in ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the [[Judy Holliday]] stage musical comedy ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]''. He won a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's ''[[Ada (film)|Ada]]'', and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, ''[[Toys in the Attic (1963 film)|Toys in the Attic]]'', opposite [[Geraldine Page]], as well as in 1970's drama ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', a huge box-office success.\n\nSinatra and he teamed up for several more movies, the crime caper ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', the musical ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'', and the Western comedies ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' and ''[[4 for Texas]]'', often with their Rat Pack pals such as [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]], as well as a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]''. Martin also co-starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in a number of films, including ''Some Came Running'', ''[[Artists and Models]]'', ''[[Career (1959 film)|Career]]'', ''[[All in a Night's Work (film)|All in a Night's Work]]'', and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' He played a satiric variation of his own womanizing persona as Las Vegas singer \"Dino\" in [[Billy Wilder]]'s comedy ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]'' (1964) with [[Kim Novak]], and he poked fun at his image in films such as the ''[[Matt Helm]]'' [[spy]] [[parody|spoofs]] of the 1960s, in which he was a co-producer. In the third Matt Helm film ''[[The Ambushers (film)|The Ambushers]]'' (1967), Helm, about to be executed, receives a last cigarette and tells the provider, \"I'll remember you from the great beyond,\" continuing ''[[sotto voce]]'', \"somewhere around Steubenville, I hope.\"\n[[File:Dean Martin - Rio Bravo 1959.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'']]\nAs a singer, Martin copied the styles of Harry Mills (of the [[Mills Brothers]]), [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Perry Como]] until he developed his own and could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like Sinatra, he could not read music, but he recorded more than 100 albums and 600 songs. His signature tune, \"[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]\", knocked [[the Beatles]]' \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" off number one in the United States in 1964. This was followed by \"The Door is Still Open to My Heart\", which reached number six that year. [[Elvis Presley]] was said to have been a fan of  Martin, and patterned his performance of \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\" after Martin's style. Martin, like Elvis, was influenced by [[country music]]. By 1965, some of Martin's albums, such as ''[[Dean \"Tex\" Martin Rides Again]]'', ''[[Houston (album)|Houston]],'' ''[[Welcome to My World (Dean Martin album)|Welcome to My World]]'', and ''[[Gentle on My Mind (Dean Martin album)|Gentle on My Mind]]'', were composed of country and western songs by artists such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[Buck Owens]]. Martin often hosted country performers on his TV show and was named \"Man Of the Year\" by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1966. The final album of his recording career was 1983's ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]''.\n\nThe image of Martin as a Vegas entertainer in a tuxedo has been an enduring one. \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\", a song Martin performed in ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'', did not become a hit at the time, but has enjoyed a revival in the media and pop culture. For three decades, Martin was among the most popular acts in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Martin sang and was one of the smoothest comics in the business, benefiting from the decade of comedy with Lewis. Martin's daughter, Gail, also sang in Vegas and on many TV shows including his, co-hosting his summer replacement series on NBC. Daughter [[Deana Martin]] continues to perform, as did youngest son [[Ricci Martin]] until his death in August 2016. Eldest son Craig was a producer on Martin's television show and daughter Claudia was an actress in films such as ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]''. Though often thought of as a ladies' man, Martin spent a lot of time with his family; as second wife Jeanne put it, prior to the couple's divorce, \"He was home every night for dinner.\"\n\n===Rat Pack===\n{{Main|Rat Pack}}\n\nAs Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends [[Joey Bishop]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] formed the [[Rat Pack]], so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack centered on [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]]).\n\nThe Rat Pack was legendary for its [[Las Vegas Strip]] performances. For example, the marquee at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] might read DEAN MARTIN\u2014MAYBE FRANK\u2014MAYBE SAMMY. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers.<ref name=\"FRANKSINATRA-NANCY\">{{cite book|last=Sinatra|first=Nancy|title=Frank Sinatra: An American Legend|year=1998|publisher=Readers Digest Assn|isbn=978-0-7621-0134-4|page=156}}</ref> Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the [[George Clooney]]/[[Brad Pitt]] \"[[Ocean's Trilogy]].\"\n\n===''The Dean Martin Show''===\n[[File:Dean Martin Florence Henderson 1958.JPG|thumb|right|Martin and [[Florence Henderson]] in ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1968)]]\nIn 1965, Martin launched his weekly [[NBC]] comedy-variety series, ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy]] in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk [[crooner]], hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]]. During an interview on the British TV documentary ''Wine, Women and Song'', aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend [[Greg Garrison]], made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by [[NBCUniversal]].\n\nDespite Martin's reputation as a drinker \u2013 perpetuated via his vanity license plate \"DRUNKY\" \u2013 his alcohol use was quite disciplined.<ref>[[Richard Metzger|Metzger, Richard]] (July 8, 2011), [http://www.dangerousminds.net/index.php/comments/richard_metzger_the_time_i_met_dean_martin/ \"Richard Metzger: The time I met Dean Martin\"], Dangerous Minds, retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2019}} He was often the first to call it a night, and when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his wife and children.{{cn|date=September 2019}} He borrowed the lovable-drunk [[shtick]] from [[Joe E. Lewis]], but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Howard Hawks's ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' led to unsubstantiated claims of [[alcoholism]]. Martin starred in and co-produced four [[Matt Helm]] [[superspy]] comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of [[Westerns]]. By the early 1970s, ''The Dean Martin Show'' was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line golf balls and the [[Dean Martin Tucson Open]] was an event on golf's [[PGA Tour]] from 1972\u201375. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nNow comfortable financially, Martin began reducing his schedule. The final (1973\u20131974) season of his variety show was retooled into one of celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]], requiring less involvement. In the roasts, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of a variety of popular entertainment, athletic, and political figures. After the show's cancellation, NBC continued to air ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' as a series of TV specials through 1984.\n\n===Later career===\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for [[Reprise Records]]. Martin recorded his final Reprise album, ''[[Once in a While (Dean Martin album)|Once in a While]]'' in 1974, which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made  for [[Warner Bros. Records]]. ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]'' was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song\", which was recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, \"L.A. Is My Home\"/\"Drinking Champagne\", came in 1985. The 1974 film drama ''[[Mr. Ricco]]'' marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer. He played a featured role in the 1981 comedy ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its [[Cannonball Run II|sequel]], both starring [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nIn 1972, he filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He joined the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night of December 23, 1973, and his contract required him to star in a film (''Mr. Ricco '') for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin was 55 when he married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to [[Gail Renshaw]], [[Miss World]]\u2013U.S.A. 1969. Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.\n\nHe also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon'' in September 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage. As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience gave the two a [[standing ovation]] and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \"So, you working?\" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing  \"at the 'Meggum'\" (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, in 1989, on Martin's 72nd birthday.<ref name=Talevski>{{cite book|last=Talevski|first=Nick|title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84609-091-2|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and family==\nMartin was married three times. His first wife was Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 \u2013 July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Martin and McDonald married in 1941 and had four children:\n\n* Craig Martin (born 1942).\n* Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 \u2013 February 16, 2001).\n* Gail Martin (born 1945)\n* [[Deana Martin]] (born 1948).\n\nMartin and McDonald divorced in 1949 and Dean gained custody of their children. Betty lived out her life in relative obscurity in San Francisco, California.\n\nMartin's second wife was Dorothy Jean \"Jeanne\" Biegger (March 27, 1927 \u2013 August 24, 2016), a former [[Orange Bowl]] queen from [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949\u20131973) and produced three children: \n* [[Dean Paul Martin]] (November 17, 1951 \u2013 March 21, 1987).\n* [[Ricci Martin]] (September 20, 1953 \u2013 August 3, 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/music/people-news/ricci-martin-dead-musician-son-dean-martin-dies-1201832100/|title=Ricci Martin, Musician and Son of Dean Martin, Dies at 62|publisher=Variety|website=variety.com|date=6 August 2016|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref> \n* Gina Martin (born 1956).\n\nMartin's third marriage, to Catherine Hawn, lasted three years before Martin initiated divorce proceedings.

He also had a minor hit single with \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\" and made his first music video, which appeared on [[MTV]]. The video was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (formerly Dino of the 1960s \"[[teenybopper|teeny-bopper]]\" rock group [[Dino, Desi & Billy]]), died when his [[F-4 Phantom II]] jet fighter crashed while flying with the [[California Air National Guard]]. Martin's grief over his son's death left him depressed and demoralized. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.\n\nMartin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra's insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally's Hotel in 1990. There he had his final reunion with Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former [[Rat Pack]] members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr's 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, he congratulated Sinatra on his 75th birthday special.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Dean Martin Grave.JPG|thumb|upright=1|Crypt of Dean Martin, at [[Westwood Memorial Park]]]]\nMartin, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993, and was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it.

Road signs bearing an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear. In 2005, [[Clark County, Nevada]], renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in [[Rancho Mirage, California]]. Martin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for ''[[Dino: The Essential Dean Martin]],'' his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified \"Platinum\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=DINO+-+THE+ESSENTIAL+DEAN+MARTIN#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFor the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and [[Martina McBride]] duet of \"[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]\" reached No. 7 on the R&R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&R Country chart \u2013 the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song \"[[I Will (Dick Glasser song)|I Will]],\" which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart. An album of duets, ''[[Forever Cool]]'', was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin's voice with [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Shelby Lynne]], [[Joss Stone]], [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], [[Robbie Williams]], McBride and others. His footprints were immortalized at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in 1964. Martin has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television. In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf.

Mantegna was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the role. British actor [[Jeremy Northam]] portrayed the entertainer in the 2002 made-for-TV movie ''[[Martin and Lewis (film)|Martin and Lewis]]'', alongside ''[[Will & Grace]]'''s [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Jerry Lewis.\n\nMartin is the subject of ''Dean Martin's Wild Party'' and ''Dean Martin's Vegas Shindig'', a pair of video slot machines found in many casinos. The games feature songs sung by Martin during the bonus feature and the count-up of a player's winnings. A compilation album called ''Amore!'' debuted at Number One on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Top Pop Catalog Albums]] chart in its February 21, 2009, issue.\n\nIn 1998, The [[MTV]] animated show [[Celebrity Deathmatch]] had a clay-animated fight to the death between Martin and comedian Jerry Lewis. Martin wins by whacking Jerry out of the ring. ''[[The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas]]'' has been a successful tribute show, featuring Martin impersonators, on stage in Europe and North America since 2000. The walk-up song for [[Francisco Cervelli]], a catcher for the [[Atlanta Braves]], is the Dean Martin tune \"That's Amore\". In [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]]'s animated theatrical cartoon series ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', the Ant's voice was performed by [[John Byner]] as an imitation of Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnbyner.com/the-works/animated-voices/ant-and-aardvark-episodes/|title=John Byner\u00bb Ant and Aardvark Episodes|website=johnbyner.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Leszczak |first1=Bob |title=The Odd Couple on Stage and Screen: A History with Cast and Crew Profiles and an Episode Guide |date=2014 |publisher=McFarland & Co. |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786477906 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPdWBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31&dq=%22john+byner%22+%22jackie+mason%22+aardvark#v=onepage&q=%22john%20byner%22%20%22jackie%20mason%22%20aardvark |accessdate=2016-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Further|Dean Martin discography}}\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since the game was played in [[Los Angeles]], there was no network [[List of NFC Championship Game broadcasters|telecast]] of the [[1951 NFL Championship Game]] because at that time there was no way to send live TV programs from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and vice versa.\n\nABC first broadcast regular season National Football League games in [[1953 NFL season|1953]]. At the time, they only broadcast [[1953 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] home games and [[1953 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Cardinals]] home games. Beginning in [[1954 NFL season|1954]], ABC added [[1954 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] home games. In ABC's final year of their initial go around with the National Football League, they added [[1955 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] and [[1955 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] games (for the [[Pacific Time Zone]] [[List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state)|affiliates]]) to go along with their coverage of the Bears and Cardinals. Wire accounts found in newspaperarchive.com indicated that the [[1953 Washington Redskins season|Washington]]-[[1953 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]] game in Week 2 of the 1953 season, was to have been regionally televised by ABC, but the cables needed for the telecast never arrived. The articles said that [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Bert Bell]] was \"fuming\" over the incident. \n\nFor the Chicago-based games, ABC used Red Grange and Bill Fay<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?534255-Retro-Philadelphia-Sun-Sept-27-1953|title=Retro: Philadelphia Sun, Sept 27, 1953|last= |first= |date=June 5, 2008|website=RadioDiscussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/thanksgiving.shtml|title=Thanksgiving Day Games|last= |first= |date= |website=The Gridiron Uniform Database|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> on commentary. When ABC added the Redskins to their schedule in 1954, they used [[Bob Wolff]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pilotonline.com/sports/article_1dda4622-842c-5364-a115-1b565e79c702.html|title=In their 75 years, Skins have made history|last=Ducibella|first=Tim|date=September 6, 2007|website=The Virginian-Pilot|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and [[Dutch Bergman]]. For games featuring the 49ers and the Rams in 1955, ABC used [[Bob Kelley]] plus Bill Brundige on the Rams telecast. [[Bob Fouts]] and [[Frankie Albert]] were on the commentary for 49ers games. Although for the first two weeks of the 1955 season, the roles were reversed. In the event that the 49ers were in Chicago to play the Bears (which occurred in Week 3 of the 1955 season on October 8), then ABC would use Red Grange and Bill Fay. However, on November 13 (Week 8 of the 1955 season), when the Rams traveled to Chicago to face the Bears, ABC employed a split-commentary concept with Bob Kelley and Bill Brundige calling the game for viewers in Pacific areas and Red Grange and Bill Fay calling the game for viewers in the Midwest. If the 49ers were in Los Angeles to play the Rams (like in Week 7 of the 1955 season), then they used Bob Fouts and Frankie Albert. \n\nABC's relationship with the NFL at this point pretty much ended when CBS began carrying regular season games across its network nationwide in [[1956 NFL season|1956]]. This came off the heels of the NFL's previous principal network TV partner, the [[NFL on DuMont|DuMont Network]] suspending its operations. Less than five years later however, ABC became the initial network television partner for the [[American Football League]]. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the [[List of AFL Championship Game broadcasters|AFL Championship Game]] and the [[List of AFL All-Star Game broadcasters|AFL All-Star Game]].  These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#1960\u20131969|Thanksgiving Day]].  This became the first ever cooperative television plan for [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]], in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the [[National Football League]] would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]] to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts.\n\n===Monday night National Football League games prior to 1970===\n\nDuring the early 1960s, [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during [[prime time]] that could be viewed by a greater television audience (while the [[National Football League|NFL]] had scheduled Saturday night games on the [[NFL on DuMont|DuMont Television Network]] in [[1953 NFL season|1953]] and [[1954 NFL season|1954]], poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] took over the rights in [[1956 NFL season|1956]]). An early bid by the league in [[1964 NFL season|1964]] to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at [[high school football]] games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] and [[1964 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] for a game on September 28, [[1964 NFL season|1964]]. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in [[Detroit]] up to that point.\n\nTwo years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the [[1966 NFL season|1966]] and [[1967 NFL season|1967]] seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] followed suit in [[American Football League seasons#1968|1968]] and [[American Football League seasons#1969|1969]] with games involving [[American Football League]] teams.\n\n===Negotiations with ABC===\nDuring subsequent negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] (coinciding with the completion of a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. After sensing reluctance from both NBC and CBS in disturbing their regular programming schedules, Rozelle spoke with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nDespite the network's status at the time as the lowest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] of the [[Big Three television networks|three major broadcast networks]], ABC was also reluctant to enter the risky venture. It was only after Rozelle used the threat of signing a deal with the independent [[Hughes Sports Network]], an entity bankrolled by reclusive businessman [[Howard Hughes]], did ABC sign a contract for the scheduled games. Speculation was that had Rozelle signed with Hughes, many ABC affiliates would have pre-empted the network's Monday lineup in favor of the games, severely damaging potential ratings.\n\nAfter the final contract for ''Monday Night Football'' was signed, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] producer [[Roone Arledge]] immediately saw possibilities for the new program. Setting out to create an entertainment \"spectacle\" as much as a simple sports broadcast, Arledge hired [[Chet Forte]], who would serve as director of the program for over 22 years. Arledge also ordered twice the usual number of cameras to cover the game, expanded the regular two-man broadcasting booth to three, and used extensive graphic design within the show as well as [[instant replay]].\n\n==1970\u20131985: Founding era==\n<!-- [[1976 Pro Bowl]] contains a direct link to this section --> \n{{See also|Monday Night Football results (1970\u20131989)}}\n\nPrior to [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Monday night games were not scheduled in the final week (Week 14) of the regular season. From [[1974 NFL season|1974]] to [[1977 NFL season|1977]], a Saturday night game was scheduled for Week 14 and televised live by ABC in lieu of a game on Monday night.\n\n===Cosell, Jackson, and Meredith===\nLooking for a lightning rod to garner attention, Arledge hired controversial New York City sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]] as a commentator, along with veteran football play-by-play announcer [[Keith Jackson]]. Arledge had tried to draw in [[Curt Gowdy]] and then [[Vin Scully]] to ABC for the ''MNF'' play-by-play role, but settled for Jackson after they proved unable to break their respective existing contracts with [[NBC Sports]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. [[Jack Buck]] was also considered, but when Arledge assistant [[Chuck Howard]] telephoned Buck with the job offer, Buck refused to respond due to anger at his treatment by ABC during an earlier stint with the network.<ref>{{cite book|title=That's a Winner!|author=Jack Buck|author2=Rob Rains|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|page=140|year=1997}}</ref> Arledge's original choice for the third member of the trio, [[Frank Gifford]], was unavailable since he was still under contract to [[CBS Sports]]. However, Gifford suggested former [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[quarterback]] [[Don Meredith]], setting the stage for years of fireworks between the often-pompous Cosell and the laid-back Meredith.\n\n''Monday Night Football'' first aired on ABC on September 21, 1970, with a game between the [[1970 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[1970 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. Advertisers were charged US$65,000 per minute by ABC during the clash, a cost that proved to be a bargain when the contest collected 33% of the viewing audience. The Browns defeated the Jets, 31\u201321 in a game which featured a 94-yard kickoff return for a [[touchdown]] by the Browns' [[Homer Jones (American football)|Homer Jones]] to open the second half, and was punctuated when [[Billy Andrews]] intercepted [[Joe Namath]] late in the fourth quarter and returned it 25 yards for the clinching touchdown. However, Cleveland viewers saw different programming on [[WEWS-TV]], because of the NFL's [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules of the time (this would apply for all games through the end of the [[1972 NFL season|1972 season]]; beginning in 1973, home games could be televised if tickets were sold out 72 hours before kickoff).\n\nOne of the trademarks of ''Monday Night Football'' is a music cue used during the opening teasers of each program, a [[Johnny Pearson]]-composition titled \"[[Heavy Action]]\", originally a [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] production library cue (and also used as the theme music for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] program ''[[Superstars]]''), which ''MNF'' began using in 1975.\n\nThat success would continue over the course of the season, helping establish a phenomenon on Monday nights in the [[Fall (season)|fall]]: movie attendance dropped, [[bowling]] leagues shifted to Tuesday nights and a [[Seattle]] hospital established an unwritten rule of no births during games.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nCosell's presence initially caused [[Henry Ford II]], chairman of the [[Ford Motor Company]], the program's main sponsor, to ask for his removal. ABC refused, and Ford had a change of heart once the show's ratings were made public. Cosell dodged another controversy when he appeared to be intoxicated on-air during the November 23 game between the [[1970 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1970 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Already ill, Cosell drank at a promotional party prior to the game, then ended up vomiting on Don Meredith's cowboy boots near the end of the first half. Jackson and Meredith ended up announcing the rest of the contest.\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, and Meredith===\nIn [[1971 NFL season|1971]], Frank Gifford became available after his contract with CBS Sports expired; Arledge brought him to ABC to serve as play-by-play announcer, replacing Jackson (who returned to broadcasting [[College American football|college football]] for the network, which he continued to do for the next 35 seasons). The former [[New York Giants|New York Giant]] had been an NFL analyst for CBS during the 1960s but had never called play-by-play prior to joining ''Monday Night Football''. In that capacity for ''Monday Night Football'' from 1971 to [[1985 NFL season|1985]], Gifford was often criticized for his see-no-evil approach in regard to discussing the NFL, earning him the dubious nickname \"Faultless Frank.\" Regardless, Gifford would have the longest tenure of any broadcaster on the show, lasting until [[1998 NFL season|1998]].\n\nCosell's abrasive personality gave him enough recognition to host a live [[variety show]] on ABC in the fall of 1975. That show is remembered today only as a trivia question, as its title, ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell|Saturday Night Live]]'', prevented [[Saturday Night Live|a new late-night sketch comedy program on NBC]] from using that title until the ABC show was canceled. That seeming popularity was in contrast to the repeated criticisms in the media, as well as bar room contests in which winners were allowed to throw a brick through a television image of Cosell.\n\nAfter beginning with critical acclaim, Meredith began to take his weekly assignments less seriously, while also beginning an acting career. By [[1973 NFL season|1973]], his motivation for the broadcasts seemed highly suspect, given incidents during a trio of contests. On October 29, Meredith was drinking during the [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]&ndash;[[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] game, which was preceded one week earlier by his pre-game analysis of the [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]&ndash;[[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] game: \"We're in the [[Denver|Mile High City]] and I sure am\" \u2013 a not-so-subtle reference to his use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at the time. Finally, during the [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]&ndash;[[1973 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] game on November 5, he referred to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] as \"Tricky Dick\".\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Williamson, and Karras===\nDon Meredith would be absent from ''Monday Night Football'' for a broadcasting and acting career on rival [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] from [[1974 NFL season|1974]] to [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. [[Fred Williamson]], a former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defensive back nicknamed \"The Hammer\" for his often-brutal hits, was selected by ABC to replace Meredith in 1974, but following a few pre-season broadcasts, proved so inarticulate that he was relieved of his duties prior to the start of the regular season, becoming the first ''MNF'' personality not to last an entire season (much less no part of the regular season at all). Williamson was replaced by fellow [[Gary, Indiana]] native [[Alex Karras]], formerly of the [[Detroit Lions]]. The highlight of Williamson's ''MNF'' career was probably at the introductory press conference where he quipped that he was hired to \"bring some color to the booth.\"\n\nKarras made his debut on September 16, 1974 and immediately made an impact when he jokingly referred to [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]' defensive lineman [[Otis Sistrunk]] as having attended \"The University of [[Mars]].\" That would essentially be the high point of Karras' three-year tenure, with a developing movie career often distracting him from showing any improvement (in reality, Sistrunk did not attend any college but enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after high school and played semi-professional football before getting a tryout with the Raiders; the Raiders team guide listed his college alma mater as \"U.S. Mars\").\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Tarkenton===\nMeredith returned to the ABC booth in 1977, but seemed to lack the enthusiasm that had marked his first stint from 1970 to 1973. While the NFL moved to a 16-week schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Meredith was contractually obligated to work only 14 games, leaving Cosell and Gifford to work games as a duo or with newly retired [[Fran Tarkenton]] beginning in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].\n\nFrom 1977 to [[1986 NFL season|1986]], ABC also aired occasional NFL games on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Each of these telecasts would be billed by the network as a \"Special Thursday/Saturday/Sunday Night Edition of ''Monday Night Football''\".\n\nOne of the more somber contests in the run of the series came on November 27, 1978 when the [[1978 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] hosted the [[1978 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Earlier in the day, [[List of Mayors of San Francisco, California|San Francisco mayor]] [[George Moscone]] and City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] had been murdered at City Hall. Despite the complaints that followed, the NFL chose to play the game, a decision that mirrored the league's decision to play its scheduled games during the weekend following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]] [[1963 NFL season|15 years earlier]].\n\nThe opening contest of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]] saw a poignant moment as former [[New England Patriots]] wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was introduced to a sellout crowd at the [[1979 New England Patriots season|Patriots]]' [[Schaefer Stadium]]. Stingley had been [[paralysis|paralyzed]] in a preseason game the year before and was making his first visit to the stadium since the accident.\n\n===1980===\nDuring the 1980 season, ''Monday Night Football'' continued its tradition of featuring notable guests during the half-time show, from a variety of different industries and backgrounds.  During a ''Thursday Night Football'' special in Houston, 2 days after Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House, Vice-President elect [[George H.W. Bush]] was interviewed in the broadcast booth at halftime.  Prior to the election, none of the candidates were invited on the program due to equal time regulations governing appearances during campaigns.  Later that same season in Southern California, movie star [[Bo Derek]], well known for her role in the movie \"Ten\", was the half-time guest and was interviewed by Howard Cosell.  Some of the production crew teasingly referred to the segment as \"The Beauty and the Beast\".\n\n1980 also marked some key personnel moves for the top-rated ABC show.  It was the first season of ''Monday Night Football'' produced by [[Bob Goodrich]], who would lead the production team for another 6 years.  In addition, 1980 was the first year a woman joined the traveling production crew of over 40 cameramen, engineers, producers and directors.  Alexis Denny, then a sophomore at [[Yale University]], served as the stage manager of the telecasts and wrote the script for the half-time highlights that Howard Cosell would voice over in a style for which he was known throughout his career.\n\n====John Lennon tragedy====\nOne of the most remembered moments in ''Monday Night Football'' history occurred on December 8, [[1980 NFL season|1980]], yet had nothing to do with the game or football in general. During a game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Howard Cosell broke the news that former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]] had been [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.995themountain.com/guides/aahtml/wav/00jl806.wav|work=995themountain.com}}</ref> news that stunned a nationwide audience.\n{{cquote|Yes, we have to say it. Remember, this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable [[tragedy]] confirmed to us by [[ABC News]] in New York City: [[John Lennon]], outside of his apartment building on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of [[The Beatles]], shot twice in the back, rushed to [[Roosevelt Hospital]], dead ... on ... arrival.}} In 1974, Lennon had appeared in the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast booth and was briefly interviewed by Cosell.\n\n===1982 contract renewal===\nThe NFL's television contract renewal in 1982 also put ABC in the [[Super Bowl]] rotation for the first time, giving it the broadcast rights to [[Super Bowl XIX]] in 1985. A second renewal of the television contract gave them the rights to [[Super Bowl XXII]] in 1988.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, ABC also aired a Friday night game in the final week (Week 16) of the regular season, in addition to the normal Monday night game.\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson===\nCosell continued to draw criticism during ''Monday Night Football'' with one of his offhand comments during the September 5, [[1983 NFL season|1983]] game, igniting a controversy and laying the groundwork for his departure at the end of that season. In a game between the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], Cosell referred to [[Alvin Garrett]], an [[African American]] [[wide receiver]] for the Redskins, as a \"little monkey.\" Cosell noted that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his grandchildren. Later, a special on Howard Cosell showed him calling Mike Adamle (a white player) a \"little monkey.\" Stung by the unrelenting barrage of remarks, Cosell claimed upon his departure from ''Monday Night Football'' that the NFL had become \"a stagnant bore.\" In Cosell's book, ''[[I Never Played the Game]]'', he devoted an entire chapter (\"Monkey Business\") to the Garrett episode. In the book, Cosell also said that ABC should have had the right to choose its own ''Monday Night'' schedule. In his mind, ''Monday Night Football'' is what elevated the NFL in popularity over [[Major League Baseball]]. He felt that this should have been ABC's reward for raising the league's profile.\n\nThat same year, [[O. J. Simpson]] replaced Tarkenton as a fill-in when Meredith or Cosell, who also was a broadcaster for the network's coverage of the [[Major League Baseball on ABC|Major League Baseball]] playoffs, was unavailable. The season would serve as a study in contrasts as one of the most exciting Monday night games ever was followed the next week by one of the most badly played in the run of the series. On October 17, 1983, the second  highest scoring game in ''Monday Night Football'' history took place in the [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]-Washington Redskins game, with the Packers winning the game by a score of 48\u201347. One week later, the [[1983 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1983 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] played for more than four hours before settling for a 20\u201320 [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] tie, ''MNF''{{'}}s only OT tie to date. The deadlock had come after dropped touchdown passes by Cardinal wide receivers [[Willard Harrell]] and [[Roy Green]], and a trio of missed field goals by teammate [[Neil O'Donoghue]], including two in the final 63 seconds of the overtime period.\n\n===Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson===\nWhen Cosell left prior to the start of the [[1984 NFL season|1984]] season, the trio of Gifford, Meredith and Simpson handled the duties. Cosell's departure seemed to have the greatest effect on Meredith, who many believed to be a poor analyst in his absence. Falling ratings also gave indications that much of the mystique that surrounded the weekly event had disappeared.\n\n===Gifford, Simpson, and Namath===\nAfter the 1984 season, ABC replaced Meredith with [[Joe Namath]] the following year, with the quarterback making his debut in the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]]. In a coincidental twist, both Namath and Simpson were busy prior to the telecast with their induction into the shrine.\n\nOne of the more grisly moments in ''Monday Night Football'' history occurred during a game between the [[1985 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[1985 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 18, 1985, at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]. Redskins quarterback [[Joe Theismann]]'s career would end when Giants linebacker [[Lawrence Taylor]] reached from behind to drag him down and Taylor fell heavily on the quarterback's leg in the process. On the play, which viewers could see in a gruesome slow-motion replay, Theismann suffered a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=Theismann's career ended in a horrific moment|url=http://washingtontimes.com/sports/20031110-122902-9456r.htm|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|date=November 10, 2003}}</ref> The injury ended the playing career of Theismann, who had teamed with Gifford and Meredith on ABC's coverage of [[Super Bowl XIX]] in January 1985.\n\nTwo weeks after that painful memory, the program's most watched contest took place as the previously unbeaten [[1985 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] were defeated by the [[1985 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], who had not lost to a [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) team at home since 1976. That would turn out to be Chicago's only loss in [[1985 NFL season|1985]]. The game broadcast earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 29.6 with a 46 share.\n\n==1986\u20132005: Al Michaels era==\n{{See also|Major League Baseball on ABC|1987 World Series|1988 National League Championship Series|1989 World Series|Monday Night Football results (1990\u20132009)}}\nBoth Namath and Simpson would be replaced at the end of the 1985 NFL season, with critics noting their lack of journalistic skills in comparison to Cosell. In their place the following year came veteran broadcaster [[Al Michaels]], who had previously anchored ABC's pregame coverage of Super Bowl XIX, and had been the lead play-by-play announcer of ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'' since [[1983 in baseball|1983]]. Michaels had also by this point, gained much acclaim at ABC for his [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]] \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" broadcast.\n\n===Gifford and Michaels===\nMichaels served as the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Gifford for a two-man booth in 1986. During that season, the [[1986 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] again made records with the biggest blowout in ''Monday Night Football'' history in a 45\u20133 rout of the then 10-1 [[1986 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] (the record was later tied and subsequently broken in [[2005 NFL season|2005]]; see below). Also in 1986, when Al Michaels became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's [[1986 American League Championship Series|League Championship Series]], Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while [[Lynn Swann]] or [[O.J. Simpson]] filled-in as the [[color commentator]]. Gifford would once again call the play-by-play when Michaels was busy calling the [[World Series]] in [[1987 NFL season|1987]] and [[1989 NFL season|1989]] and the [[National League Championship Series]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]].\n\n===Gifford, Michaels, and Dierdorf===\nIn 1987, Gifford and Michaels were joined by [[Dan Dierdorf]], returning the series to its original concept of three announcers in the booth. The trio would last for 11 seasons through the conclusion of the [[1997 NFL season|1997]] season. In 1989, television composer [[Edd Kalehoff]] created a new arrangement of Johnny Pearson's \"Heavy Action\", by that time fully synonymous with the series. This more or less replaced an original composition by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]. Also debuting in 1989 was [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] performing \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\", sung to the music of his 1984 hit \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]].\"\n\n====1989 contract renewal====\nAs part of the league's television contract renewal with the network in 1989, ABC was awarded the television rights to [[Super Bowl XXV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]], and the first round of NFL playoffs. The ''Monday Night Football'' announcing team anchored the telecasts, except for the first of two Wild Card Playoff games, in which ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN's Sunday Night]]'' NFL crew of [[Mike Patrick]] and Joe Theismann presided over that telecast. However, the original crew for one of the two Wild Card Playoff games from [[1990 NFL season|1990]] to [[1995 NFL season|1995]] consisted of [[Brent Musburger]] and [[Dick Vermeil]] (both of whom did college football broadcasts for ABC during those two seasons).\n\nFrom 1990 until 2005, ABC's ''MNF'' television package included seventeen (eighteen in 1992 and 1993) regular season games (from [[2003 NFL season|2003]] until 2005, a Thursday game and 16 Mondays \u2013 no game on Week 17 because of playoff preparation disadvantages), the first two wild card [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games (held on the first Saturday of the playoffs), and at times, the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]\u2013[[National Football Conference|NFC]] [[Pro Bowl]].\n\n====1994====\nThe October 17, [[1994 NFL season|1994]] episode between the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] featured a duel between two future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] quarterbacks, [[Joe Montana]] and [[John Elway]]. With 1:29 left to play in the game, Elway scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Broncos ahead 28\u201324. But then Montana led the Chiefs on a 75-yard drive to score the game-winning touchdown with just 8 seconds to play. The final score was Chiefs 31, Broncos 28.\n\nThe October 31, 1994 game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is notable for a very windy/rainy game, which also featured the [[Crypt Keeper]] deliver the famous phase, and also remembered with a 36-yard TD run by Brett Favre, who had a sore hip that night. Later dubbed the Halloween Monsoon by Bear fans, the Packers crushed the Bears, 33\u20136.\n\n====1995====\nIn the [[1995 NFL season|1995]] ''MNF'' regular season opener between the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and [[1995 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at the [[Giants Stadium|New Jersey Meadowlands]], Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]] controversially brought [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] chairman [[Phil Knight]] down to the sidelines, representing Jones' individual deal with Nike, contrary to the NFL's policy at the time of negotiating its marketing deals as a league (it wasn't until 2002 that the league's first league-wide uniform contract with Reebok was made; Nike would replace Reebok in that capacity in 2012).\n\n====1997====\nIn [[1997 NFL season|1997]], ABC began using a [[Digital on-screen graphic|scoring bug]] showing the game clock and score throughout the entire broadcast.\n\n===Michaels, Dierdorf, and Esiason===\nIn 1998, [[Lesley Visser]] became the first female commentator on ''Monday Night Football''. She had been the first female beat writer in the NFL when she covered the [[New England Patriots]] for the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' in the mid-1970s, and was the first and only woman to handle a [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Trophy]] presentation when she was a sportscaster with CBS. Visser was followed by several women, notably [[Melissa Stark]] and [[Lisa Guerrero]], on the sideline who were perceived as \"[[attractiveness|eye candy]]\", none of whom affected the ratings.\n\nFor the 1998 season, ABC pushed ''Monday Night Football'' back an hour (it has usually aired at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]). A special [[pre-game show]] was created, ''Monday Night Blast'', hosted by [[Chris Berman]] from the [[ESPN Zone]] restaurant in [[Baltimore]]. The game would start around 8:20&nbsp;p.m. Eastern for this particular season. Despite leaving the booth, Frank Gifford stayed on one more year as a special contributor to the pre-game show, usually presenting a single segment.\n\nA mildly infamous incident came during the final 1998 telecast when Dierdorf asked Michaels, prior to a halftime interview with [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback [[Doug Flutie]], \"Are you gonna tell 'em how you're sick of all this B.C. [Boston College] stuff?\" Michaels (thinking that they had gone into a commercial break and that his microphone was off) replied, \"No shit.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nNielsen ratings data for the first 17 weeks of the 1998\u201399 television season showed that ''Monday Night Football'' averaged a 13.9 rating, down 8% from the 15.0 average rating for the broadcasts in 1997 \u2013 the previous standard in ratings futility. In actuality, ''MNF'' ratings had been hitting all-time record lows for the previous four years.\n\n===Michaels and Esiason===\nBeginning in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts used a computer-generated yellow line to mark where a team needs to get a first down, a method first used by ABC sister cable channel [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]]. 1999 also saw the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game being moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night. It would remain on Monday night through 2005.\n\n[[Boomer Esiason]] replaced Gifford in 1998, and Dierdorf left for a return to [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] in [[1999 NFL season|1999]]. Esiason's relationship with Michaels was questioned leading to his firing. Esiason and Michaels reportedly never got along, and it led to ABC firing Esiason shortly after calling [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] together.\n<!-- These quotes need a specific source cited:\nEsiason complained to the ''New York Times'' that Michaels ''\"could have been better for me, and I tried with him, but it never clicked with me because he never wanted it to click.\"'' To that, Michaels gave a terse response to Esiason's claims in a released statement:''\"I will not join in this juvenile vitriol.\"'' -->\n\n===Michaels, Fouts, and Miller===\n====2000====\nUnexpectedly, comedian [[Dennis Miller]] joined the cast in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], along with [[Dan Fouts]].<ref name=\"MillerMNF\">{{cite news|title=Dennis Miller a surprise addition to MNF<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/0622/598628.htmlwork=ESPN.com|date=June 22, 2000}}</ref> The move was ultimately regarded as a bust by many viewers and commentators. ABC briefly considered adding radio personality [[Rush Limbaugh]] before Miller was added to the broadcast team, despite having no prior sports broadcast experience (Limbaugh would instead be assigned as a commentator to ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' on ABC sister [[ESPN]]). Miller demonstrated a knowledge of the game and its personalities, although at times he tended to lapse into sometimes obscure analogy-riddled [[Stream of consciousness writing|streams of consciousness]] similar to the \"rants\" of his standup comedy act. ABC even set up a webpage dedicated to explaining Miller's sometimes obscure [[popular culture|pop culture]] references. Soon, it would become apparent that Miller's comedy did not mix with football.\n\nIn June 2000, Lesley Visser's career suffered a highly publicized setback when she was famously bounced as the ''Monday Night Football'' sideline reporter for a less experienced, much younger woman and a man, who did not have as extensive journalistic credentials as Visser. \"It was staggering to me\", Visser later recalled. However, she wound up returning to CBS Sports, philosophical as ever. \"You can have a short career if it's based on looks and youth\", she said, \"but legitimacy is what lasts.\" Which ABC replaced her with both Melissa Stark and [[Eric Dickerson]]. This was part of the overhaul when ABC brought back [[Don Ohlmeyer]] to serve as producer, who installed Dennis Miller as an analyst (for ultimately two unsuccessful seasons). She sued ABC Sports for age discrimination, with Howard Katz and Ohlmeyer being named as co-defendants.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in 2000, Don Ohlmeyer, the program's producer up until 1977 was brought back.<ref name=\"MillerMNF\"/> After spending time at [[NBC]], Ohlmeyer was lured out of retirement to spark interest and provide some vigor to the broadcast. Besides the on-air talent, Ohlmeyer's changes included clips of players introducing themselves, new graphics and music. In another rather irreverent move, the [[Digital on-screen graphic|scoring bug]] began incorporating nicknames for the teams, such as \"Skins\" and \"Fins\" (for the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]) instead of their respective common abbreviations, WSH and MIA.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, the [[2000 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and [[2000 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] competed in what is now known as ''[[The Monday Night Miracle (American football)|The Monday Night Miracle]]''. Trailing 30\u20137 in the fourth quarter, [[Vinny Testaverde]] led the Jets to score 23 consecutive points to tie the game. After Miami scored another touchdown, Testaverde threw to offensive tackle [[Jumbo Elliott (American football)|Jumbo Elliott]] to tie the game at 37-all. At 1:08&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, the game having crossed into Tuesday morning, [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]] kicked a field goal in overtime to win the game 40\u201337. It was the second biggest fourth quarter comeback in NFL history and biggest comeback in Jets' history. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] predicted the comeback at halftime, where he was appearing with the ''MNF'' crew to promote his upcoming movie, ''[[The 6th Day]]''. With the Jets already down by 20 points he said, \"Wayne Chrebet will catch a pass and the Jets will win. They're a great team.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n====2001====\nThe [[2001 NFL season|2001]] season of ''MNF'' featured a season-long campaign promoting the anticipated 20,000th point scored in ''MNF'' history. [[2001 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] kicker [[Jason Elam]] completed the task with a field goal during a 38\u201328 loss at [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5. The three points also put Elam over 1,000 points for his career. In addition, the scoring bug reverted to using the team abbreviations, as opposed to the nickname scheme used in the previous season.\n\n===Michaels and Madden===\nIn [[2002 NFL season|2002]], both Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts were dropped and [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]] joined Al Michaels in a two-man booth. Madden was a coach for the [[Oakland Raiders]], namesake of the seminal ''[[Madden NFL]]'' video game series, and a successful broadcaster for 21 years \u2013 first with [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] until 1993 and then with [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] \u2013 before joining ''Monday Night Football''.\n\n====2002====\n{{See also|List of Pro Bowl broadcasters}}\nIn 2002, the broadcast debuted the \"[[Horse trailer|Horse Trailer]]\" award, in which a picture of the game's top performer(s) is displayed, as chosen by the broadcasting crew. During the fourth quarter of a preseason game early that season, Madden was joking about doing some recording in the \"Horse Trailer\", a term the producers used for one of the ABC production trucks. It was, in fact, a custom-built trailer designed from the shell of a horse trailer, but housed sophisticated electronic equipment inside it. By the first week of the regular season, an idea to decorate the plain white trailer with ''MNF'' decor, the entire ''MNF'' schedule, and a weekly [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], was born. Immediately following each game, the winner(s) is chosen, and his picture is affixed to the trailer in the corresponding location. When Madden and Michaels went to [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], they debuted a similar feature, the ''Rock Star'' \u2013 in which the photo of the player of the game was attached to the top of [[NBC Studios (New York)|30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in New York City (the \"Horse Trailer\" concept was reinstated for the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season).\n\nIn addition to Fouts and Madden helming the regular season broadcasts, Brent Musburger and [[Gary Danielson]] served as commentators for that year's AFC Wild Card game, with [[Jack Arute]] serving as the sideline reporter.\n\nAfter suffering through several years of dismal [[NFL Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] ratings, ABC considered moving the game to Monday night. In February 2003, Madden declined to serve as color commentator for the game in [[Hawaii]], citing his [[fear of flying]]; former ''MNF'' personality Dan Fouts took his place. The [[2003 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] held the following year was played on a Sunday as typical, but was moved to ABC's sister network ESPN.\n\n====2003====\nIn 2003, ABC and the NFL dropped the ''Monday Night Football'' game for the final week of the regular season. The move, which had been in effect for the first eight years of the broadcast ([[1970 NFL season|1970]]\u2013[[1977 NFL season|1977]]), was the result of declining ratings, as well as problems involved for potential playoff teams, as there was a potential of only four days rest between their final regular season game and first-round playoff game. ABC replaced the telecast with an opening weekend Thursday night game, and in exchange ESPN got a Saturday night game on the final weekend.\n\nAlso during the 2003 season, Lisa Guerrero decided to leave [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]]'s ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' to join the ''MNF'' television crew as a sideline reporter (replacing the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] Melissa Stark). Guerrero's performance on the broadcast was heavily criticized, and the following year (also in an apparent move away from the \"eye candy\" concept) ABC replaced her with longtime TV sports journalist [[Michele Tafoya]]. Guerrero defended herself by saying that the show hired her with the intention of going in a totally different direction with the job of sideline reporter \u2013 personality-driven and feature-driven \u2013 then discarded all of that and told her to just do the job in the usual fashion. She said that she never would have taken the job if she had known that they would change their minds like that. In 2005, Michele Tafoya sat out much of the season while on [[Parental leave|maternity leave]], with [[Sam Ryan]] temporarily taking her place.\n\nDuring the October 6, 2003 game between the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], Indianapolis was trailing 35\u201314 with 3:43 remaining. The Colts had returned a Tampa Bay kickoff 90 yard to the 11-yard line, setting up a quick score. The Colts recovered an [[onside kick]] and scored again to narrow the margin to 35\u201328. They forced a Bucs punt and with less than two minutes remaining, [[Peyton Manning]] led an 87-yard drive to score the game-tying touchdown with 35 seconds left in regulation. In overtime, kicker [[Mike Vanderjagt]] missed a 40-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]], but [[Simeon Rice]] was called for a [[leaping]] penalty, a rarely seen unsportsmanlike conduct infraction that penalizes a player for running and jumping to block a kick and landing on other players. Vanderjagt's subsequent kick was batted and hit the upright, but fell in good, winning the game for the Colts. Vanderjagt went on to become the second kicker in NFL history not to miss either a field goal or extra point in a single season after [[Gary Anderson (placekicker)|Gary Anderson]], who accomplished the feat in the 1998 season as a member of the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. Vanderjagt did not miss a kick in the playoffs either, making him the first kicker to accomplish that feat (Anderson missed a field goal in the 1998-99 NFC Championship Game).\n\nOn December 22, 2003, [[2003 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] put on one of the most defining moments of his career (while also ranking among his greatest game ever). The day before the contest against the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], his father, [[Irvin Favre|Irvin]], died suddenly of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Favre elected to play, passing for four touchdowns in the first half, and 399 yards for the game in a 41\u20137 destruction of the Raiders (receiving applause from the highly partisan \"[[Raider Nation]]\"). Afterwards, Brett said, {{cquote|I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight.}}\n\n====2004====\nOn November 15, [[2004 NFL season|2004]], controversy shrouded [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] when he appeared with actress [[Nicollette Sheridan]] (one of the stars of the new hit ABC comedy-drama ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'') in an introductory skit which opened that evening's ''MNF'' telecast, in which Owens and the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] played the [[2004 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at [[Texas Stadium]]. The skit was widely condemned as being sexually suggestive (see video<ref>{{YouTube|title=Monday Night Football<!-- Bot generated title -->|id=ZGFIePxLbQk}}</ref>) and ABC was forced to apologize for airing it (the Eagles went on to win the game, 49\u201321, with Owens catching three touchdown passes). However, on March 14, 2005, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled that the skit did not violate decency standards, because it contained no outright nudity or foul language. Originally, John Madden was supposed to appear in the commercial.\n\n====2005====\nFor the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, which would become the network's final season as the ''MNF'' broadcaster and used through [[Super Bowl XL]], ABC converted its scoring bug into a horizontal time-score banner placed across the bottom of the screen.\n\n=====\"Monday Night Massacre\" (Seahawks)=====\nOn December 5, 2005, in a game dubbed \"The Monday Night Massacre\" by [[NFL Films]], the [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] shut out the [[2005 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 42\u20130 with three defensive touchdowns (two interceptions, one fumble return). This tied the then-largest margin of victory mark in ''Monday Night Football'' history and set the mark for the greatest margin of victory in a Monday night shutout. This also set the NFL record for scoring the most points with less than 200 yards of offense. [[Andre Dyson]] scored twice for the Seahawks defense, once on a 72-yard interception return and the other on a 25-yard fumble return, earning himself the \"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\" as well as NFC defensive player of the week. A fourth interception return by [[Michael Boulware]] fell just short of tying another Seahawks NFL record of four defensive scores in a single game, set during a 45\u20130 victory over the [[1984 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in 1984. The defeat was the Eagles third-worst in team history, tied for the worst loss in Monday Night history, and was the worst shutout loss. This was due to the Eagles' major injuries such as star quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] (who was hurt in a Week 10 loss to the Cowboys) and the after-effects of the [[Terrell Owens]] saga earlier that year. The Eagles also lost their star [[running back]] [[Brian Westbrook]] due to an injury in this game.\n\n===End of the ABC era===\nDespite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to [[National Football League on television#Flexible scheduling|flexible scheduling]], a method by which some of the NFL's best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC's ratings on Sunday night, and the network's wish of protecting its ''Desperate Housewives'' franchise (which they knew would be costly), on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]];<ref>{{cite news|title='Monday Night Football' Changes the Channel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A63538-2005Apr18?language=printer|author=Leonard Shapiro|author2=Mark Maske|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|page=A1|date=April 19, 2005}}</ref> the move was criticized by some of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] shareholders (as well as NFL fans and purists). However, ESPN's ability to collect subscription fees from cable and satellite providers, in addition to selling commercials, made it more likely that ESPN could turn a profit on NFL telecasts, as opposed to ABC's heavy losses.\n\nThe final ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast on ABC aired on December 26, 2005, when the [[2005 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] hosted the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] from [[Giants Stadium]]. Coincidentally, both the first and last ABC ''Monday Night Football'' game telecasts ended with a score of 31\u201321 with the Jets on the losing end. Vinny Testaverde holds the distinction of throwing the last TD pass in ABC's ''MNF'' telecast history; it was to wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]]. Also, Testaverde's pass set an NFL record: most consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass, 19 seasons (1987\u20132005). Patriots [[linebacker]] [[Mike Vrabel]] set a record of note during that last ABC telecast, becoming the first player to catch two [[touchdown]] passes and record a [[quarterback sack]] in the same game. The final play of the ABC era was a Pats kneeldown by 44-year-old reserve quarterback [[Doug Flutie]]. John Madden said at the show's ending: {{cquote|They can take football away from ABC on Monday nights, but they can't take away the memories.}}\n\nDuring its final NFL television contract, ABC was awarded the telecasts to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]], [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] and Super Bowl XL. With the end of ABC's contract, the Super Bowl XL broadcast was the network's final NFL telecast until 2016, when they simulcasted ESPN's Wild Card game production.  To replace ''Monday Night Football,'' ABC turned its series of primetime college football specials, which had run until 1975 and again from 1990 to 1993 and from 1996 onward, into a [[ABC Saturday Night Football|regular series]].  The network also acquired the rights to the [[CMA Awards]] ceremony.  The Monday after ABC's final Monday Night game saw the premiere of ''[[Dancing With the Stars]].''\n\n==2006\u2013present: ESPN era==\n===Move to ESPN===\nThe changes to the NFL's prime time broadcasts took place with the 2006 season, as ESPN began airing the Monday night games at the same time [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] assumed the rights to the [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday night package from ESPN]]. The Sunday night game is now the \"showcase\" game of the week on the NFL schedule.\n\nWhile the ESPN broadcasts still carry the ''MNF'' name and heritage, NBC (like ABC) is a [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] network, whereas ESPN is a [[cable network|cable channel]] not freely available to all Americans, though per a clause in the NFL's broadcasting rules, many ESPN games air on a participating broadcast television station in the home markets of each team to allow viewers who do not subscribe to a pay television provider to view the game. For that reason, NBC gained rights to the Thursday night season-opening game, the [[NFL Wild Card|Wild Card]] doubleheader that has traditionally aired on ABC, as well as a share of the rotating rights to the Super Bowl (with CBS and Fox also in the mix).\n\nESPN had initially stated that its ''MNF'' team would consist of Al Michaels and Joe Theismann in the booth, with Michele Tafoya and [[Suzy Kolber]] serving as sideline reporters. However, on February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that former NBA studio host [[Mike Tirico]] would replace Michaels in the booth in 2006, joined by Theismann, and [[Tony Kornheiser]]. ESPN announced the following day that it had \"traded\" the contract of Michaels to NBC in exchange for some [[NBCUniversal]] properties, including rights to [[Ryder Cup]] coverage, and the return of the rights to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] (a [[Walt Disney]] creation) to ESPN parent [[The Walt Disney Company]] after nearly 80 years of Universal ownership.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stay 'tooned: Disney gets 'Oswald' for Al Michaels \u2013 NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2324417|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\n====Secondary broadcast teams====\nSince the program's move to ESPN in 2006, the network has broadcast two games in a [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] on the opening week of the season, with the second game using separate announcers and production staff that are not used for the rest of the schedule. On September 11, 2006, the announcers for the second game were [[Brad Nessler]], Ron Jaworski and [[Dick Vermeil]]. On September 10, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the team of [[Mike Greenberg]] and [[Mike Golic]] (co-hosts of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'') presided alongside [[Mike Ditka]]. For both games, [[Bonnie Bernstein]] was the sideline reporter.\n\nGreenberg, Golic and Ditka served as the secondary team for the September 8, [[2008 NFL season|2008]] game, with Suzy Kolber on the sidelines. The September 14, 2009 game had [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] join Greenberg, Golic and Kolber. On September 13, [[2010 NFL season|2010]], Nessler and [[Trent Dilfer]] teamed to call the second game, with Kolber again on the sidelines.\n\n===Tirico, Theismann, and Kornheiser===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\nESPN's first Monday night broadcast was a preseason game held on August 14, 2006, when the [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] visited the [[2006 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], publicized as the return of [[Randy Moss]] to Minnesota for the first time since the Vikings traded him after the 2004 season. The telecast debuted with brand-new graphics, including a time-score box placed in the lower center of the screen; a variation of the ''MNF'' graphics began to be used on almost all sporting events televised by ESPN and ABC (the former of which effectively took over full responsibility of ABC's sports division that year, which was rebranded as [[ESPN on ABC]]). The first regular season ''Monday Night Football'' game to air on ESPN was on September 11, 2006, featuring the visiting Minnesota Vikings at the [[2006 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] at [[FedExField]], in which the Vikings won 19\u201316.\n\nThe September 25 edition of ''Monday Night Football'' highlighted the [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]' first game back in the [[Louisiana Superdome]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]] to take on the [[2006 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. The game had a Super Bowl-like atmosphere with performances by the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[U2]] and [[Green Day]] before the game. The NFL tapped producer [[Don Mischer]] and director [[Hamish Hamilton]] to produce the event. Former President [[George H. W. Bush]] handled the pregame coin toss. The Saints beat the Falcons 23\u20133 in what now ranks as one of the most-watched events in the history of cable television.\n\nESPN's October 23, 2006 game telecast between the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] drew the largest audience in the history of cable television at the time, besting the previous mark set by a 1993 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) debate between [[Al Gore]] and [[Ross Perot]]. An average of 16,028,000 viewers (12.8 rating) watched as the Giants defeated the Cowboys, 36\u201322. ESPN's ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts now account for eight of the ten highest-rated programs in cable television history.\n\nWhat would eventually be named the \"NFL's comeback of the year\" was played on ''Monday Night Football'' on October 16. Late in the third quarter, the massive underdog [[2006 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] led the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 23\u20133. Arizona seemed to have the game wrapped up, as rookie quarterback [[Matt Leinart]] was having a great day, and Arizona had forced six turnovers out of Chicago quarterback [[Rex Grossman]]. Chicago's defense then went on to score 14 points on fumble returns for touchdowns. With 2:58 left in the fourth quarter, and down 17\u201323, Chicago's [[Devin Hester]] returned a punt for a touchdown to take a 24\u201323 lead. Leinart then led the Cardinals down the field, only to have [[Neil Rackers]] miss a field goal, and Chicago [[2006 Chicago Bears\u2013Arizona Cardinals game|went on to win]].\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 season, ESPN had managed to secure all of the cable television audience records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} ''Monday Night Football'' and its surrounding shoulder programming also became the most profitable franchise on cable television.\n\n===Tirico, Jaworski, and Kornheiser===\nAnalyst and former NFL quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] replaced Joe Theismann, who was offered a prominent football analyst job with ESPN, in the booth beginning with the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jaworski replacing Theismann in MNF booth \u2013 NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2812834&campaign=rss&source=NFLHeadlines|work=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]}}</ref>\n\n====2007====\nOn December 3, 2007, 17.5 million people watched the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] defeat the [[2007 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], 27\u201324.

The Redskins won the first meeting that [[2010 NFL season|season]] by a score of 17\u201312; however, in the first half of the game, Eagles star quarterback [[Michael Vick]] suffered a rib injury knocking him out of the game, resulting in [[Kevin Kolb]] taking over. After the game, McNabb gave a post-game speech in the locker room in which he stated the Eagles made a mistake by trading him. Before the game, McNabb signed a five-year contract extension worth $78 million, after being benched in the fourth quarter just a week earlier. The very first play of the game Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to [[DeSean Jackson]].\n\nThe Redskins were criticized for their lack of coverage because the Eagles were known for going deep on the first play; the Eagles' next two possessions led to touchdowns. The very first play of the second quarter, with Philadelphia up 28\u20130, saw Vick throw a 48-yard touchdown to [[Jeremy Maclin]]. With Philadelphia up 45\u201321 at halftime, Vick threw a three-yard touchdown to [[Jason Avant]] in the third quarter to make the score 52\u201321. During the play, Vick scrambled, waiting for someone to get open when [[Albert Haynesworth]] (who signed a six-year $100 million contract with the Redskins the year prior) had fallen down and continued to lie on the field as Vick continued to scramble. The very next Redskins possession had McNabb throw a pick six to [[Dimitri Patterson]], helping the Eagles score seven points.\n\nThe Redskins went on to score one more touchdown, however their seven-point run was not able to stop Philadelphia, which defeated Washington 59\u201328. McNabb finished the game with 295 yards on 17 for 31, along with two touchdowns and three interceptions. The Eagles finished with 593 offense yards (setting a new team record); Vick went 20 of 28 for 333 yards throwing four touchdowns, and also ran for 80 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries. He became the first player with at least 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing four passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns in a game. Vick's performance in the game also moved him past Steve Young for second place on the all-time list for rushing yards by a quarterback.\n\n===Hank Williams Jr. controversy===\nOn October 3, 2011, Hank Williams Jr. made controversial remarks during an interview on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', when talking about a golf outing he went on that summer with [[Barack Obama]], [[John Boehner]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[John Kasich]].

Wire accounts found in newspaperarchive.com indicated that the [[1953 Washington Redskins season|Washington]]-[[1953 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]] game in Week 2 of the 1953 season, was to have been regionally televised by ABC, but the cables needed for the telecast never arrived. The articles said that [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Bert Bell]] was \"fuming\" over the incident. \n\nFor the Chicago based games, ABC used Red Grange and Bill Fay<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?534255-Retro-Philadelphia-Sun-Sept-27-1953|title=Retro: Philadelphia Sun, Sept 27, 1953|last= |first= |date=June 5, 2008|website=RadioDiscussions|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/thanksgiving.shtml|title=Thanksgiving Day Games|last= |first= |date= |website=The Gridiron Uniform Database|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> on commentary. When ABC added the Redskins to their schedule in 1954, they used [[Bob Wolff]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pilotonline.com/sports/article_1dda4622-842c-5364-a115-1b565e79c702.html|title=In their 75 years, Skins have made history|last=Ducibella|first=Tim|date=September 6, 2007|website=The Virginian-Pilot|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and [[Dutch Bergman]]. For games featuring the 49ers and the Rams in 1955, ABC used [[Bob Kelley]] plus Bill Brundige on the Rams telecast. [[Bob Fouts]] and [[Frankie Albert]] were on the commentary for 49ers games. Although for the first two weeks of the 1955 season, the roles were reversed. In the event that the 49ers were in Chicago to play the Bears (which occurred in Week 3 of the 1955 season on October 8), then ABC would use Red Grange and Bill Fay. However, on November 13 (Week 8 of the 1955 season), when the Rams traveled to Chicago to face the Bears, ABC employed a split-commentary concept with Bob Kelley and Bill Brundige calling the game for viewers in Pacific areas and Red Grange and Bill Fay calling the game for viewers in the Midwest. If the 49ers were in Los Angeles to play the Rams (like in Week 7 of the 1955 season), then they used Bob Fouts and Frankie Albert. \n\nABC's relationship with the NFL at this point pretty much ended when CBS began carrying regular season games across its network nationwide in [[1956 NFL season|1956]]. This came off the heels of the NFL's previous principal network TV partner, the [[NFL on DuMont|DuMont Network]] suspending its operations. Less than five years later however, ABC became the initial network television partner for the [[American Football League]]. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the [[List of AFL Championship Game broadcasters|AFL Championship Game]] and the [[List of AFL All-Star Game broadcasters|AFL All-Star Game]].  These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#1960\u20131969|Thanksgiving Day]].  This became the first ever cooperative television plan for [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]], in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the [[National Football League]] would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]] to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts.\n\n===Monday night National Football League games prior to 1970===\n\nDuring the early 1960s, [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during [[prime time]] that could be viewed by a greater television audience (while the [[National Football League|NFL]] had scheduled Saturday night games on the [[NFL on DuMont|DuMont Television Network]] in [[1953 NFL season|1953]] and [[1954 NFL season|1954]], poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] took over the rights in [[1956 NFL season|1956]]). An early bid by the league in [[1964 NFL season|1964]] to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at [[high school football]] games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] and [[1964 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] for a game on September 28, [[1964 NFL season|1964]]. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in [[Detroit]] up to that point.\n\nTwo years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the [[1966 NFL season|1966]] and [[1967 NFL season|1967]] seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] followed suit in [[American Football League seasons#1968|1968]] and [[American Football League seasons#1969|1969]] with games involving [[American Football League]] teams.\n\n===Negotiations with ABC===\nDuring subsequent negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] (coinciding with the completion of a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. After sensing reluctance from both NBC and CBS in disturbing their regular programming schedules, Rozelle spoke with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nDespite the network's status at the time as the lowest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] of the [[Big Three television networks|three major broadcast networks]], ABC was also reluctant to enter the risky venture. It was only after Rozelle used the threat of signing a deal with the independent [[Hughes Sports Network]], an entity bankrolled by reclusive businessman [[Howard Hughes]], did ABC sign a contract for the scheduled games. Speculation was that had Rozelle signed with Hughes, many ABC affiliates would have pre-empted the network's Monday lineup in favor of the games, severely damaging potential ratings.\n\nAfter the final contract for ''Monday Night Football'' was signed, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] producer [[Roone Arledge]] immediately saw possibilities for the new program. Setting out to create an entertainment \"spectacle\" as much as a simple sports broadcast, Arledge hired [[Chet Forte]], who would serve as director of the program for over 22 years. Arledge also ordered twice the usual number of cameras to cover the game, expanded the regular two-man broadcasting booth to three, and used extensive graphic design within the show as well as [[instant replay]].\n\n==1970\u20131985: Founding era==\n<!-- [[1976 Pro Bowl]] contains a direct link to this section --> \n{{See also|Monday Night Football results (1970\u20131989)}}\n\nPrior to [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Monday night games were not scheduled in the final week (Week 14) of the regular season. From [[1974 NFL season|1974]] to [[1977 NFL season|1977]], a Saturday night game was scheduled for Week 14 and televised live by ABC in lieu of a game on Monday night.\n\n===Cosell, Jackson, and Meredith===\nLooking for a lightning rod to garner attention, Arledge hired controversial New York City sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]] as a commentator, along with veteran football play-by-play announcer [[Keith Jackson]]. Arledge had tried to draw in [[Curt Gowdy]] and then [[Vin Scully]] to ABC for the ''MNF'' play-by-play role, but settled for Jackson after they proved unable to break their respective existing contracts with [[NBC Sports]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. [[Jack Buck]] was also considered, but when Arledge assistant [[Chuck Howard]] telephoned Buck with the job offer, Buck refused to respond due to anger at his treatment by ABC during an earlier stint with the network.<ref>{{cite book|title=That's a Winner!|author=Jack Buck|author2=Rob Rains|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|page=140|year=1997}}</ref> Arledge's original choice for the third member of the trio, [[Frank Gifford]], was unavailable since he was still under contract to [[CBS Sports]]. However, Gifford suggested former [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[quarterback]] [[Don Meredith]], setting the stage for years of fireworks between the often-pompous Cosell and the laid-back Meredith.\n\n''Monday Night Football'' first aired on ABC on September 21, 1970, with a game between the [[1970 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[1970 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. Advertisers were charged US$65,000 per minute by ABC during the clash, a cost that proved to be a bargain when the contest collected 33% of the viewing audience. The Browns defeated the Jets, 31-21 in a game which featured a 94-yard kickoff return for a [[touchdown]] by the Browns' [[Homer Jones (American football)|Homer Jones]] to open the second half, and was punctuated when [[Billy Andrews]] intercepted [[Joe Namath]] late in the fourth quarter and returned it 25 yards for the clinching touchdown. However, Cleveland viewers saw different programming on [[WEWS-TV]], because of the NFL's [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules of the time (this would apply for all games through the end of the [[1972 NFL season|1972 season]]; beginning in 1973, home games could be televised if tickets were sold out 72 hours before kickoff).\n\nOne of the trademarks of ''Monday Night Football'' is a music cue used during the opening teasers of each program, a [[Johnny Pearson]]-composition titled \"[[Heavy Action]]\", originally a [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] production library cue (and also used as the theme music for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] program ''[[Superstars]]''), which ''MNF'' began using in 1975.\n\nThat success would continue over the course of the season, helping establish a phenomenon on Monday nights in the [[Fall (season)|fall]]: movie attendance dropped, [[bowling]] leagues shifted to Tuesday nights and a [[Seattle]] hospital established an unwritten rule of no births during games.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nCosell's presence initially caused [[Henry Ford II]], chairman of the [[Ford Motor Company]], the program's main sponsor, to ask for his removal. ABC refused, and Ford had a change of heart once the show's ratings were made public. Cosell dodged another controversy when he appeared to be intoxicated on-air during the November 23 game between the [[1970 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1970 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Already ill, Cosell drank at a promotional party prior to the game, then ended up vomiting on Don Meredith's cowboy boots near the end of the first half. Jackson and Meredith ended up announcing the rest of the contest.\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, and Meredith===\nIn [[1971 NFL season|1971]], Frank Gifford became available after his contract with CBS Sports expired; Arledge brought him to ABC to serve as play-by-play announcer, replacing Jackson (who returned to broadcasting [[College American football|college football]] for the network, which he continued to do for the next 35 seasons). The former [[New York Giants|New York Giant]] had been an NFL analyst for CBS during the 1960s but had never called play-by-play prior to joining ''Monday Night Football''. In that capacity for ''Monday Night Football'' from 1971 to [[1985 NFL season|1985]], Gifford was often criticized for his see-no-evil approach in regard to discussing the NFL, earning him the dubious nickname \"Faultless Frank.\" Regardless, Gifford would have the longest tenure of any broadcaster on the show, lasting until [[1998 NFL season|1998]].\n\nCosell's abrasive personality gave him enough recognition to host a live [[variety show]] on ABC in the fall of 1975. That show is remembered today only as a trivia question, as its title, ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell|Saturday Night Live]]'', prevented [[Saturday Night Live|a new late-night sketch comedy program on NBC]] from using that title until the ABC show was canceled. That seeming popularity was in contrast to the repeated criticisms in the media, as well as bar room contests in which winners were allowed to throw a brick through a television image of Cosell.\n\nAfter beginning with critical acclaim, Meredith began to take his weekly assignments less seriously, while also beginning an acting career. By [[1973 NFL season|1973]], his motivation for the broadcasts seemed highly suspect, given incidents during a trio of contests. On October 29, Meredith was drinking during the [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]&ndash;[[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] game, which was preceded one week earlier by his pre-game analysis of the [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]&ndash;[[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] game: \"We're in the [[Denver|Mile High City]] and I sure am\" \u2013 a not-so-subtle reference to his use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at the time. Finally, during the [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]&ndash;[[1973 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] game on November 5, he referred to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] as \"Tricky Dick\".\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Williamson, and Karras===\nDon Meredith would be absent from ''Monday Night Football'' for a broadcasting and acting career on rival [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] from [[1974 NFL season|1974]] to [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. [[Fred Williamson]], a former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defensive back nicknamed \"The Hammer\" for his often-brutal hits, was selected by ABC to replace Meredith in 1974, but following a few pre-season broadcasts, proved so inarticulate that he was relieved of his duties prior to the start of the regular season, becoming the first ''MNF'' personality not to last an entire season (much less no part of the regular season at all). Williamson was replaced by fellow [[Gary, Indiana]] native [[Alex Karras]], formerly of the [[Detroit Lions]]. The highlight of Williamson's ''MNF'' career was probably at the introductory press conference where he quipped that he was hired to \"bring some color to the booth.\"\n\nKarras made his debut on September 16, 1974 and immediately made an impact when he jokingly referred to [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]' defensive lineman [[Otis Sistrunk]] as having attended \"The University of [[Mars]].\" That would essentially be the high point of Karras' three-year tenure, with a developing movie career often distracting him from showing any improvement (in reality, Sistrunk did not attend any college but enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after high school and played semi-professional football before getting a tryout with the Raiders; the Raiders team guide listed his college alma mater as \"U.S. Mars\").\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Tarkenton===\nMeredith returned to the ABC booth in 1977, but seemed to lack the enthusiasm that had marked his first stint from 1970 to 1973. While the NFL moved to a 16-week schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Meredith was contractually obligated to work only 14 games, leaving Cosell and Gifford to work games as a duo or with newly retired [[Fran Tarkenton]] beginning in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].\n\nFrom 1977 to [[1986 NFL season|1986]], ABC also aired occasional NFL games on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Each of these telecasts would be billed by the network as a \"Special Thursday/Saturday/Sunday Night Edition of ''Monday Night Football''\".\n\nOne of the more somber contests in the run of the series came on November 27, 1978 when the [[1978 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] hosted the [[1978 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Earlier in the day, [[List of Mayors of San Francisco, California|San Francisco mayor]] [[George Moscone]] and City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] had been murdered at City Hall. Despite the complaints that followed, the NFL chose to play the game, a decision that mirrored the league's decision to play its scheduled games during the weekend following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]] [[1963 NFL season|15 years earlier]].\n\nThe opening contest of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]] saw a poignant moment as former [[New England Patriots]] wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was introduced to a sellout crowd at the [[1979 New England Patriots season|Patriots]]' [[Schaefer Stadium]]. Stingley had been [[paralysis|paralyzed]] in a preseason game the year before and was making his first visit to the stadium since the accident.\n\n===1980===\nDuring the 1980 season, ''Monday Night Football'' continued its tradition of featuring notable guests during the half-time show, from a variety of different industries and backgrounds.  During a ''Thursday Night Football'' special in Houston, 2 days after Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House, Vice-President elect [[George H.W. Bush]] was interviewed in the broadcast booth at halftime.  Prior to the election, none of the candidates were invited on the program due to equal time regulations governing appearances during campaigns.  Later that same season in Southern California, movie star [[Bo Derek]], well known for her role in the movie \"Ten\", was the half-time guest and was interviewed by Howard Cosell.  Some of the production crew teasingly referred to the segment as \"The Beauty and the Beast\".\n\n1980 also marked some key personnel moves for the top-rated ABC show.  It was the first season of ''Monday Night Football'' produced by [[Bob Goodrich]], who would lead the production team for another 6 years.  In addition, 1980 was the first year a woman joined the traveling production crew of over 40 cameramen, engineers, producers and directors.  Alexis Denny, then a sophomore at [[Yale University]], served as the stage manager of the telecasts and wrote the script for the half-time highlights that Howard Cosell would voice over in a style for which he was known throughout his career.\n\n====John Lennon tragedy====\nOne of the most remembered moments in ''Monday Night Football'' history occurred on December 8, [[1980 NFL season|1980]], yet had nothing to do with the game or football in general. During a game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Howard Cosell broke the news that former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]] had been [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.995themountain.com/guides/aahtml/wav/00jl806.wav|work=995themountain.com}}</ref> news that stunned a nationwide audience.\n{{cquote|Yes, we have to say it. Remember, this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable [[tragedy]] confirmed to us by [[ABC News]] in New York City: [[John Lennon]], outside of his apartment building on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of [[The Beatles]], shot twice in the back, rushed to [[Roosevelt Hospital]], dead ... on ... arrival.}} In 1974, Lennon had appeared in the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast booth and was briefly interviewed by Cosell.\n\n===1982 contract renewal===\nThe NFL's television contract renewal in 1982 also put ABC in the [[Super Bowl]] rotation for the first time, giving it the broadcast rights to [[Super Bowl XIX]] in 1985. A second renewal of the television contract gave them the rights to [[Super Bowl XXII]] in 1988.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, ABC also aired a Friday night game in the final week (Week 16) of the regular season, in addition to the normal Monday night game.\n\n===Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson===\nCosell continued to draw criticism during ''Monday Night Football'' with one of his offhand comments during the September 5, [[1983 NFL season|1983]] game, igniting a controversy and laying the groundwork for his departure at the end of that season. In a game between the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], Cosell referred to [[Alvin Garrett]], an [[African American]] [[wide receiver]] for the Redskins, as a \"little monkey.\" Cosell noted that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his grandchildren. Later, a special on Howard Cosell showed him calling Mike Adamle (a white player) a \"little monkey.\" Stung by the unrelenting barrage of remarks, Cosell claimed upon his departure from ''Monday Night Football'' that the NFL had become \"a stagnant bore.\" In Cosell's book, ''[[I Never Played the Game]]'', he devoted an entire chapter (\"Monkey Business\") to the Garrett episode. In the book, Cosell also said that ABC should have had the right to choose its own ''Monday Night'' schedule. In his mind, ''Monday Night Football'' is what elevated the NFL in popularity over [[Major League Baseball]]. He felt that this should have been ABC's reward for raising the league's profile.\n\nThat same year, [[O. J. Simpson]] replaced Tarkenton as a fill-in when Meredith or Cosell, who also was a broadcaster for the network's coverage of the [[Major League Baseball on ABC|Major League Baseball]] playoffs, was unavailable. The season would serve as a study in contrasts as one of the most exciting Monday night games ever was followed the next week by one of the most badly played in the run of the series. On October 17, 1983, the second  highest scoring game in ''Monday Night Football'' history took place in the [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]-Washington Redskins game, with the Packers winning the game by a score of 48\u201347. One week later, the [[1983 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1983 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] played for more than four hours before settling for a 20\u201320 [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] tie, ''MNF''{{'}}s only OT tie to date. The deadlock had come after dropped touchdown passes by Cardinal wide receivers [[Willard Harrell]] and [[Roy Green]], and a trio of missed field goals by teammate [[Neil O'Donoghue]], including two in the final 63 seconds of the overtime period.\n\n===Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson===\nWhen Cosell left prior to the start of the [[1984 NFL season|1984]] season, the trio of Gifford, Meredith and Simpson handled the duties. Cosell's departure seemed to have the greatest effect on Meredith, who many believed to be a poor analyst in his absence. Falling ratings also gave indications that much of the mystique that surrounded the weekly event had disappeared.\n\n===Gifford, Simpson, and Namath===\nAfter the 1984 season, ABC replaced Meredith with [[Joe Namath]] the following year, with the quarterback making his debut in the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]]. In a coincidental twist, both Namath and Simpson were busy prior to the telecast with their induction into the shrine.\n\nOne of the more grisly moments in ''Monday Night Football'' history occurred during a game between the [[1985 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[1985 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 18, 1985, at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]. Redskins quarterback [[Joe Theismann]]'s career would end when Giants linebacker [[Lawrence Taylor]] reached from behind to drag him down and Taylor fell heavily on the quarterback's leg in the process. On the play, which viewers could see in a gruesome slow-motion replay, Theismann suffered a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=Theismann's career ended in a horrific moment|url=http://washingtontimes.com/sports/20031110-122902-9456r.htm|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|date=November 10, 2003}}</ref> The injury ended the playing career of Theismann, who had teamed with Gifford and Meredith on ABC's coverage of [[Super Bowl XIX]] in January 1985.\n\nTwo weeks after that painful memory, the program's most watched contest took place as the previously unbeaten [[1985 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] were defeated by the [[1985 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], who had not lost to a [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) team at home since 1976. That would turn out to be Chicago's only loss in [[1985 NFL season|1985]]. The game broadcast earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 29.6 with a 46 share.\n\n==1986\u20132005: Al Michaels era==\n{{See also|Major League Baseball on ABC|1987 World Series|1988 National League Championship Series|1989 World Series|Monday Night Football results (1990\u20132009)}}\nBoth Namath and Simpson would be replaced at the end of the 1985 NFL season, with critics noting their lack of journalistic skills in comparison to Cosell. In their place the following year came veteran broadcaster [[Al Michaels]], who had previously anchored ABC's pregame coverage of Super Bowl XIX, and had been the lead play-by-play announcer of ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'' since [[1983 in baseball|1983]]. Michaels had also by this point, gained much acclaim at ABC for his [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]] \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" broadcast.\n\n===Gifford and Michaels===\nMichaels served as the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Gifford for a two-man booth in 1986. During that season, the [[1986 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] again made records with the biggest blowout in ''Monday Night Football'' history in a 45-3 rout of the then 10-1 [[1986 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] (the record was later tied and subsequently broken in [[2005 NFL season|2005]]; see below). Also in 1986, when Al Michaels became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's [[1986 American League Championship Series|League Championship Series]], Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while [[Lynn Swann]] or [[O.J. Simpson]] filled-in as the [[color commentator]]. Gifford would once again call the play-by-play when Michaels was busy calling the [[World Series]] in [[1987 NFL season|1987]] and [[1989 NFL season|1989]] and the [[National League Championship Series]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]].\n\n===Gifford, Michaels, and Dierdorf===\nIn 1987, Gifford and Michaels were joined by [[Dan Dierdorf]], returning the series to its original concept of three announcers in the booth. The trio would last for 11 seasons through the conclusion of the [[1997 NFL season|1997]] season. In 1989, television composer [[Edd Kalehoff]] created a new arrangement of Johnny Pearson's \"Heavy Action\", by that time fully synonymous with the series. This more or less replaced an original composition by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]. Also debuting in 1989 was [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] performing \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\", sung to the music of his 1984 hit \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]].\"\n\n====1989 contract renewal====\nAs part of the league's television contract renewal with the network in 1989, ABC was awarded the television rights to [[Super Bowl XXV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]], and the first round of NFL playoffs. The ''Monday Night Football'' announcing team anchored the telecasts, except for the first of two Wild Card Playoff games, in which ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN's Sunday Night]]'' NFL crew of [[Mike Patrick]] and Joe Theismann presided over that telecast. However, the original crew for one of the two Wild Card Playoff games from [[1990 NFL season|1990]] to [[1995 NFL season|1995]] consisted of [[Brent Musburger]] and [[Dick Vermeil]] (both of whom did college football broadcasts for ABC during those two seasons).\n\nFrom 1990 until 2005, ABC's ''MNF'' television package included seventeen (eighteen in 1992 and 1993) regular season games (from [[2003 NFL season|2003]] until 2005, a Thursday game and 16 Mondays \u2013 no game on Week 17 because of playoff preparation disadvantages), the first two wild card [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games (held on the first Saturday of the playoffs), and at times, the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]\u2013[[National Football Conference|NFC]] [[Pro Bowl]].\n\n====1994====\nThe October 17, [[1994 NFL season|1994]] episode between the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] featured a duel between two future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] quarterbacks, [[Joe Montana]] and [[John Elway]]. With 1:29 left to play in the game, Elway scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Broncos ahead 28\u201324. But then Montana led the Chiefs on a 75-yard drive to score the game-winning touchdown with just 8 seconds to play. The final score was Chiefs 31, Broncos 28.\n\nThe October 31, 1994 game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is notable for a very windy/rainy game, which also featured the [[Crypt Keeper]] deliver the famous phase, and also remembered with a 36-yard TD run by Brett Favre, who had a sore hip that night. Later dubbed the Halloween Monsoon by Bear fans, the Packers crushed the Bears, 33-6.\n\n====1995====\nIn the [[1995 NFL season|1995]] ''MNF'' regular season opener between the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and [[1995 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at the [[Giants Stadium|New Jersey Meadowlands]], Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]] controversially brought [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] chairman [[Phil Knight]] down to the sidelines, representing Jones' individual deal with Nike, contrary to the NFL's policy at the time of negotiating its marketing deals as a league (it wasn't until 2002 that the league's first league-wide uniform contract with Reebok was made; Nike would replace Reebok in that capacity in 2012).\n\n====1997====\nIn [[1997 NFL season|1997]], ABC began using a [[Digital on-screen graphic|scoring bug]] showing the game clock and score throughout the entire broadcast.\n\n===Michaels, Dierdorf, and Esiason===\nIn 1998, [[Lesley Visser]] became the first female commentator on ''Monday Night Football''. She had been the first female beat writer in the NFL when she covered the [[New England Patriots]] for the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' in the mid-1970s, and was the first and only woman to handle a [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Trophy]] presentation when she was a sportscaster with CBS. Visser was followed by several women, notably [[Melissa Stark]] and [[Lisa Guerrero]], on the sideline who were perceived as \"[[attractiveness|eye candy]]\", none of whom affected the ratings.\n\nFor the 1998 season, ABC pushed ''Monday Night Football'' back an hour (it has usually aired at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]). A special [[pre-game show]] was created, ''Monday Night Blast'', hosted by [[Chris Berman]] from the [[ESPN Zone]] restaurant in [[Baltimore]]. The game would start around 8:20&nbsp;p.m. Eastern for this particular season. Despite leaving the booth, Frank Gifford stayed on one more year as a special contributor to the pre-game show, usually presenting a single segment.\n\nA mildly infamous incident came during the final 1998 telecast when Dierdorf asked Michaels, prior to a halftime interview with [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback [[Doug Flutie]], \"Are you gonna tell 'em how you're sick of all this B.C. [Boston College] stuff?\" Michaels (thinking that they had gone into a commercial break and that his microphone was off) replied, \"No shit.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nNielsen ratings data for the first 17 weeks of the 1998\u201399 television season showed that ''Monday Night Football'' averaged a 13.9 rating, down 8% from the 15.0 average rating for the broadcasts in 1997 \u2013 the previous standard in ratings futility. In actuality, ''MNF'' ratings had been hitting all-time record lows for the previous four years.\n\n===Michaels and Esiason===\nBeginning in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts used a computer-generated yellow line to mark where a team needs to get a first down, a method first used by ABC sister cable channel [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]]. 1999 also saw the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game being moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night. It would remain on Monday night through 2005.\n\n[[Boomer Esiason]] replaced Gifford in 1998, and Dierdorf left for a return to [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] in [[1999 NFL season|1999]]. Esiason's relationship with Michaels was questioned leading to his firing. Esiason and Michaels reportedly never got along, and it led to ABC firing Esiason shortly after calling [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] together.\n<!-- These quotes need a specific source cited:\nEsiason complained to the ''New York Times'' that Michaels ''\"could have been better for me, and I tried with him, but it never clicked with me because he never wanted it to click.\"'' To that, Michaels gave a terse response to Esiason's claims in a released statement:''\"I will not join in this juvenile vitriol.\"'' -->\n\n===Michaels, Fouts, and Miller===\n====2000====\nUnexpectedly, comedian [[Dennis Miller]] joined the cast in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], along with [[Dan Fouts]].<ref name=\"MillerMNF\">{{cite news|title=Dennis Miller a surprise addition to MNF<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/0622/598628.htmlwork=ESPN.com|date=June 22, 2000}}</ref> The move was ultimately regarded as a bust by many viewers and commentators. ABC briefly considered adding radio personality [[Rush Limbaugh]] before Miller was added to the broadcast team, despite having no prior sports broadcast experience (Limbaugh would instead be assigned as a commentator to ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' on ABC sister [[ESPN]]). Miller demonstrated a knowledge of the game and its personalities, although at times he tended to lapse into sometimes obscure analogy-riddled [[Stream of consciousness writing|streams of consciousness]] similar to the \"rants\" of his standup comedy act. ABC even set up a webpage dedicated to explaining Miller's sometimes obscure [[popular culture|pop culture]] references. Soon, it would become apparent that Miller's comedy did not mix with football.\n\nIn June 2000, Lesley Visser's career suffered a highly publicized setback when she was famously bounced as the ''Monday Night Football'' sideline reporter for a less experienced, much younger woman and a man, who did not have as extensive journalistic credentials as Visser. \"It was staggering to me\", Visser later recalled. However, she wound up returning to CBS Sports, philosophical as ever. \"You can have a short career if it's based on looks and youth\", she said, \"but legitimacy is what lasts.\" Which ABC replaced her with both Melissa Stark and [[Eric Dickerson]]. This was part of the overhaul when ABC brought back [[Don Ohlmeyer]] to serve as producer, who installed Dennis Miller as an analyst (for ultimately two unsuccessful seasons). She sued ABC Sports for age discrimination, with Howard Katz and Ohlmeyer being named as co-defendants.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in 2000, Don Ohlmeyer, the program's producer up until 1977 was brought back.<ref name=\"MillerMNF\"/> After spending time at [[NBC]], Ohlmeyer was lured out of retirement to spark interest and provide some vigor to the broadcast. Besides the on-air talent, Ohlmeyer's changes included clips of players introducing themselves, new graphics and music. In another rather irreverent move, the [[Digital on-screen graphic|scoring bug]] began incorporating nicknames for the teams, such as \"Skins\" and \"Fins\" (for the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]) instead of their respective common abbreviations, WSH and MIA.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, the [[2000 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and [[2000 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] competed in what is now known as ''[[The Monday Night Miracle (American football)|The Monday Night Miracle]]''. Trailing 30\u20137 in the fourth quarter, [[Vinny Testaverde]] led the Jets to score 23 consecutive points to tie the game. After Miami scored another touchdown, Testaverde threw to offensive tackle [[Jumbo Elliott (American football)|Jumbo Elliott]] to tie the game at 37-all. At 1:08&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, the game having crossed into Tuesday morning, [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]] kicked a field goal in overtime to win the game 40\u201337. It was the second biggest fourth quarter comeback in NFL history and biggest comeback in Jets' history. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] predicted the comeback at halftime, where he was appearing with the ''MNF'' crew to promote his upcoming movie, ''[[The 6th Day]]''. With the Jets already down by 20 points he said, \"Wayne Chrebet will catch a pass and the Jets will win. They're a great team.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n====2001====\nThe [[2001 NFL season|2001]] season of ''MNF'' featured a season-long campaign promoting the anticipated 20,000th point scored in ''MNF'' history. [[2001 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] kicker [[Jason Elam]] completed the task with a field goal during a 38\u201328 loss at [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5. The three points also put Elam over 1,000 points for his career. In addition, the scoring bug reverted to using the team abbreviations, as opposed to the nickname scheme used in the previous season.\n\n===Michaels and Madden===\nIn [[2002 NFL season|2002]], both Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts were dropped and [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]] joined Al Michaels in a two-man booth. Madden was a coach for the [[Oakland Raiders]], namesake of the seminal ''[[Madden NFL]]'' video game series, and a successful broadcaster for 21 years \u2013 first with [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] until 1993 and then with [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] \u2013 before joining ''Monday Night Football''.\n\n====2002====\n{{See also|List of Pro Bowl broadcasters}}\nIn 2002, the broadcast debuted the \"[[Horse trailer|Horse Trailer]]\" award, in which a picture of the game's top performer(s) is displayed, as chosen by the broadcasting crew. During the fourth quarter of a preseason game early that season, Madden was joking about doing some recording in the \"Horse Trailer\", a term the producers used for one of the ABC production trucks. It was, in fact, a custom-built trailer designed from the shell of a horse trailer, but housed sophisticated electronic equipment inside it. By the first week of the regular season, an idea to decorate the plain white trailer with ''MNF'' decor, the entire ''MNF'' schedule, and a weekly [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], was born. Immediately following each game, the winner(s) is chosen, and his picture is affixed to the trailer in the corresponding location. When Madden and Michaels went to [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], they debuted a similar feature, the ''Rock Star'' \u2013 in which the photo of the player of the game was attached to the top of [[NBC Studios (New York)|30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in New York City (the \"Horse Trailer\" concept was reinstated for the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] season).\n\nIn addition to Fouts and Madden helming the regular season broadcasts, Brent Musburger and [[Gary Danielson]] served as commentators for that year's AFC Wild Card game, with [[Jack Arute]] serving as the sideline reporter.\n\nAfter suffering through several years of dismal [[NFL Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] ratings, ABC considered moving the game to Monday night. In February 2003, Madden declined to serve as color commentator for the game in [[Hawaii]], citing his [[fear of flying]]; former ''MNF'' personality Dan Fouts took his place. The [[2003 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] held the following year was played on a Sunday as typical, but was moved to ABC's sister network ESPN.\n\n====2003====\nIn 2003, ABC and the NFL dropped the ''Monday Night Football'' game for the final week of the regular season. The move, which had been in effect for the first eight years of the broadcast ([[1970 NFL season|1970]]\u2013[[1977 NFL season|1977]]), was the result of declining ratings, as well as problems involved for potential playoff teams, as there was a potential of only four days rest between their final regular season game and first-round playoff game. ABC replaced the telecast with an opening weekend Thursday night game, and in exchange ESPN got a Saturday night game on the final weekend.\n\nAlso during the 2003 season, Lisa Guerrero decided to leave [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]]'s ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' to join the ''MNF'' television crew as a sideline reporter (replacing the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] Melissa Stark). Guerrero's performance on the broadcast was heavily criticized, and the following year (also in an apparent move away from the \"eye candy\" concept) ABC replaced her with longtime TV sports journalist [[Michele Tafoya]]. Guerrero defended herself by saying that the show hired her with the intention of going in a totally different direction with the job of sideline reporter \u2013 personality-driven and feature-driven \u2013 then discarded all of that and told her to just do the job in the usual fashion. She said that she never would have taken the job if she had known that they would change their minds like that. In 2005, Michele Tafoya sat out much of the season while on [[Parental leave|maternity leave]], with [[Sam Ryan]] temporarily taking her place.\n\nDuring the October 6, 2003 game between the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], Indianapolis was trailing 35\u201314 with 3:43 remaining. The Colts had returned a Tampa Bay kickoff 90 yard to the 11-yard line, setting up a quick score. The Colts recovered an [[onside kick]] and scored again to narrow the margin to 35\u201328. They forced a Bucs punt and with less than two minutes remaining, [[Peyton Manning]] led an 87-yard drive to score the game-tying touchdown with 35 seconds left in regulation. In overtime, kicker [[Mike Vanderjagt]] missed a 40-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]], but [[Simeon Rice]] was called for a [[leaping]] penalty, a rarely seen unsportsmanlike conduct infraction that penalizes a player for running and jumping to block a kick and landing on other players. Vanderjagt's subsequent kick was batted and hit the upright, but fell in good, winning the game for the Colts. Vanderjagt went on to become the second kicker in NFL history not to miss either a field goal or extra point in a single season after [[Gary Anderson (placekicker)|Gary Anderson]], who accomplished the feat in the 1998 season as a member of the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. Vanderjagt did not miss a kick in the playoffs either, making him the first kicker to accomplish that feat (Anderson missed a field goal in the 1998-99 NFC Championship Game).\n\nOn December 22, 2003, [[2003 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] put on one of the most defining moments of his career (while also ranking among his greatest game ever). The day before the contest against the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], his father, [[Irvin Favre|Irvin]], died suddenly of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Favre elected to play, passing for four touchdowns in the first half, and 399 yards for the game in a 41\u20137 destruction of the Raiders (receiving applause from the highly partisan \"[[Raider Nation]]\"). Afterwards, Brett said, {{cquote|I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight.}}\n\n====2004====\nOn November 15, [[2004 NFL season|2004]], controversy shrouded [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] when he appeared with actress [[Nicollette Sheridan]] (one of the stars of the new hit ABC comedy-drama ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'') in an introductory skit which opened that evening's ''MNF'' telecast, in which Owens and the [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] played the [[2004 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at [[Texas Stadium]]. The skit was widely condemned as being sexually suggestive (see video<ref>{{YouTube|title=Monday Night Football<!-- Bot generated title -->|id=ZGFIePxLbQk}}</ref>) and ABC was forced to apologize for airing it (the Eagles went on to win the game, 49-21, with Owens catching three touchdown passes). However, on March 14, 2005, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled that the skit did not violate decency standards, because it contained no outright nudity or foul language. Originally, John Madden was supposed to appear in the commercial.\n\n====2005====\nFor the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, which would become the network's final season as the ''MNF'' broadcaster and used through [[Super Bowl XL]], ABC converted its scoring bug into a horizontal time-score banner placed across the bottom of the screen.\n\n=====\"Monday Night Massacre\" (Seahawks)=====\nOn December 5, 2005, in a game dubbed \"The Monday Night Massacre\" by [[NFL Films]], the [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] shut out the [[2005 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 42\u20130 with three defensive touchdowns (two interceptions, one fumble return). This tied the then-largest margin of victory mark in ''Monday Night Football'' history and set the mark for the greatest margin of victory in a Monday night shutout. This also set the NFL record for scoring the most points with less than 200 yards of offense. [[Andre Dyson]] scored twice for the Seahawks defense, once on a 72-yard interception return and the other on a 25-yard fumble return, earning himself the \"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\" as well as NFC defensive player of the week. A fourth interception return by [[Michael Boulware]] fell just short of tying another Seahawks NFL record of four defensive scores in a single game, set during a 45\u20130 victory over the [[1984 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in 1984. The defeat was the Eagles third-worst in team history, tied for the worst loss in Monday Night history, and was the worst shutout loss. This was due to the Eagles' major injuries such as star quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] (who was hurt in a Week 10 loss to the Cowboys) and the after-effects of the [[Terrell Owens]] saga earlier that year. The Eagles also lost their star [[running back]] [[Brian Westbrook]] due to an injury in this game.\n\n===End of the ABC era===\nDespite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to [[National Football League on television#Flexible scheduling|flexible scheduling]], a method by which some of the NFL's best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC's ratings on Sunday night, and the network's wish of protecting its ''Desperate Housewives'' franchise (which they knew would be costly), on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]];<ref>{{cite news|title='Monday Night Football' Changes the Channel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A63538-2005Apr18?language=printer|author=Leonard Shapiro|author2=Mark Maske|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|page=A1|date=April 19, 2005}}</ref> the move was criticized by some of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] shareholders (as well as NFL fans and purists). However, ESPN's ability to collect subscription fees from cable and satellite providers, in addition to selling commercials, made it more likely that ESPN could turn a profit on NFL telecasts, as opposed to ABC's heavy losses.\n\nThe final ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast on ABC aired on December 26, 2005, when the [[2005 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] hosted the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] from [[Giants Stadium]]. Coincidentally, both the first and last ABC ''Monday Night Football'' game telecasts ended with a score of 31\u201321 with the Jets on the losing end. Vinny Testaverde holds the distinction of throwing the last TD pass in ABC's ''MNF'' telecast history; it was to wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]]. Also, Testaverde's pass set an NFL record: most consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass, 19 seasons (1987\u20132005). Patriots [[linebacker]] [[Mike Vrabel]] set a record of note during that last ABC telecast, becoming the first player to catch two [[touchdown]] passes and record a [[quarterback sack]] in the same game. The final play of the ABC era was a Pats kneeldown by 44-year-old reserve quarterback [[Doug Flutie]]. John Madden said at the show's ending: {{cquote|They can take football away from ABC on Monday nights, but they can't take away the memories.}}\n\nDuring its final NFL television contract, ABC was awarded the telecasts to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]], [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] and Super Bowl XL. With the end of ABC's contract, the Super Bowl XL broadcast was the network's final NFL telecast until 2016, when they simulcasted ESPN's Wild Card game production.  To replace ''Monday Night Football,'' ABC turned its series of primetime college football specials, which had run until 1975 and again from 1990 to 1993 and from 1996 onward, into a [[ABC Saturday Night Football|regular series]].  The network also acquired the rights to the [[CMA Awards]] ceremony.  The Monday after ABC's final Monday Night game saw the premiere of ''[[Dancing With the Stars]].''\n\n==2006\u2013present: ESPN era==\n===Move to ESPN===\nThe changes to the NFL's prime time broadcasts took place with the 2006 season, as ESPN began airing the Monday night games at the same time [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] assumed the rights to the [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday night package from ESPN]]. The Sunday night game is now the \"showcase\" game of the week on the NFL schedule.\n\nWhile the ESPN broadcasts still carry the ''MNF'' name and heritage, NBC (like ABC) is a [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] network, whereas ESPN is a [[cable network|cable channel]] not freely available to all Americans, though per a clause in the NFL's broadcasting rules, many ESPN games air on a participating broadcast television station in the home markets of each team to allow viewers who do not subscribe to a pay television provider to view the game. For that reason, NBC gained rights to the Thursday night season-opening game, the [[NFL Wild Card|Wild Card]] doubleheader that has traditionally aired on ABC, as well as a share of the rotating rights to the Super Bowl (with CBS and Fox also in the mix).\n\nESPN had initially stated that its ''MNF'' team would consist of Al Michaels and Joe Theismann in the booth, with Michele Tafoya and [[Suzy Kolber]] serving as sideline reporters. However, on February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that former NBA studio host [[Mike Tirico]] would replace Michaels in the booth in 2006, joined by Theismann, and [[Tony Kornheiser]]. ESPN announced the following day that it had \"traded\" the contract of Michaels to NBC in exchange for some [[NBCUniversal]] properties, including rights to [[Ryder Cup]] coverage, and the return of the rights to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] (a [[Walt Disney]] creation) to ESPN parent [[The Walt Disney Company]] after nearly 80 years of Universal ownership.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stay 'tooned: Disney gets 'Oswald' for Al Michaels \u2013 NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2324417|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\n====Secondary broadcast teams====\nSince the program's move to ESPN in 2006, the network has broadcast two games in a [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] on the opening week of the season, with the second game using separate announcers and production staff that are not used for the rest of the schedule. On September 11, 2006, the announcers for the second game were [[Brad Nessler]], Ron Jaworski and [[Dick Vermeil]]. On September 10, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the team of [[Mike Greenberg]] and [[Mike Golic]] (co-hosts of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'') presided alongside [[Mike Ditka]]. For both games, [[Bonnie Bernstein]] was the sideline reporter.\n\nGreenberg, Golic and Ditka served as the secondary team for the September 8, [[2008 NFL season|2008]] game, with Suzy Kolber on the sidelines. The September 14, 2009 game had [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] join Greenberg, Golic and Kolber. On September 13, [[2010 NFL season|2010]], Nessler and [[Trent Dilfer]] teamed to call the second game, with Kolber again on the sidelines.\n\n===Tirico, Theismann, and Kornheiser===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\nESPN's first Monday night broadcast was a preseason game held on August 14, 2006, when the [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] visited the [[2006 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], publicized as the return of [[Randy Moss]] to Minnesota for the first time since the Vikings traded him after the 2004 season. The telecast debuted with brand-new graphics, including a time-score box placed in the lower center of the screen; a variation of the ''MNF'' graphics began to be used on almost all sporting events televised by ESPN and ABC (the former of which effectively took over full responsibility of ABC's sports division that year, which was rebranded as [[ESPN on ABC]]). The first regular season ''Monday Night Football'' game to air on ESPN was on September 11, 2006, featuring the visiting Minnesota Vikings at the [[2006 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] at [[FedExField]], in which the Vikings won 19\u201316.\n\nThe September 25 edition of ''Monday Night Football'' highlighted the [[2006 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]' first game back in the [[Louisiana Superdome]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]] to take on the [[2006 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. The game had a Super Bowl-like atmosphere with performances by the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[U2]] and [[Green Day]] before the game. The NFL tapped producer [[Don Mischer]] and director [[Hamish Hamilton]] to produce the event. Former President [[George H. W. Bush]] handled the pregame coin toss. The Saints beat the Falcons 23\u20133 in what now ranks as one of the most-watched events in the history of cable television.\n\nESPN's October 23, 2006 game telecast between the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] drew the largest audience in the history of cable television at the time, besting the previous mark set by a 1993 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) debate between [[Al Gore]] and [[Ross Perot]]. An average of 16,028,000 viewers (12.8 rating) watched as the Giants defeated the Cowboys, 36\u201322. ESPN's ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts now account for eight of the ten highest-rated programs in cable television history.\n\nWhat would eventually be named the \"NFL's comeback of the year\" was played on ''Monday Night Football'' on October 16. Late in the third quarter, the massive underdog [[2006 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] led the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 23\u20133. Arizona seemed to have the game wrapped up, as rookie quarterback [[Matt Leinart]] was having a great day, and Arizona had forced six turnovers out of Chicago quarterback [[Rex Grossman]]. Chicago's defense then went on to score 14 points on fumble returns for touchdowns. With 2:58 left in the fourth quarter, and down 17\u201323, Chicago's [[Devin Hester]] returned a punt for a touchdown to take a 24\u201323 lead. Leinart then led the Cardinals down the field, only to have [[Neil Rackers]] miss a field goal, and Chicago [[2006 Chicago Bears\u2013Arizona Cardinals game|went on to win]].\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 season, ESPN had managed to secure all of the cable television audience records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} ''Monday Night Football'' and its surrounding shoulder programming also became the most profitable franchise on cable television.\n\n===Tirico, Jaworski, and Kornheiser===\nAnalyst and former NFL quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] replaced Joe Theismann, who was offered a prominent football analyst job with ESPN, in the booth beginning with the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jaworski replacing Theismann in MNF booth \u2013 NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2812834&campaign=rss&source=NFLHeadlines|work=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]}}</ref>\n\n====2007====\nOn December 3, 2007, 17.5 million people watched the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] defeat the [[2007 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], 27\u201324.

The Redskins won the first meeting that [[2010 NFL season|season]] by a score of 17-12; however, in the first half of the game, Eagles star quarterback [[Michael Vick]] suffered a rib injury knocking him out of the game, resulting in [[Kevin Kolb]] taking over. After the game, McNabb gave a post-game speech in the locker room in which he stated the Eagles made a mistake by trading him. Before the game, McNabb signed a five-year contract extension worth $78 million, after being benched in the fourth quarter just a week earlier. The very first play of the game Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to [[DeSean Jackson]].\n\nThe Redskins were criticized for their lack of coverage because the Eagles were known for going deep on the first play; the Eagles' next two possessions led to touchdowns. The very first play of the second quarter, with Philadelphia up 28-0, saw Vick throw a 48-yard touchdown to [[Jeremy Maclin]]. With Philadelphia up 45-21 at halftime, Vick threw a three-yard touchdown to [[Jason Avant]] in the third quarter to make the score 52-21. During the play, Vick scrambled, waiting for someone to get open when [[Albert Haynesworth]] (who signed a six-year $100 million contract with the Redskins the year prior) had fallen down and continued to lie on the field as Vick continued to scramble. The very next Redskins possession had McNabb throw a pick six to [[Dimitri Patterson]], helping the Eagles score seven points.\n\nThe Redskins went on to score one more touchdown, however their seven-point run was not able to stop Philadelphia, which defeated Washington 59-28. McNabb finished the game with 295 yards on 17 for 31, along with two touchdowns and three interceptions. The Eagles finished with 593 offense yards (setting a new team record); Vick went 20 of 28 for 333 yards throwing four touchdowns, and also ran for 80 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries. He became the first player with at least 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing four passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns in a game. Vick's performance in the game also moved him past Steve Young for second place on the all-time list for rushing yards by a quarterback.\n\n===Hank Williams Jr. controversy===\nOn October 3, 2011, Hank Williams Jr. made controversial remarks during an interview on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', when talking about a golf outing he went on that summer with [[Barack Obama]], [[John Boehner]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[John Kasich]].

After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended.

The team has won two regular season conference championships, in 2013 and 2015. The Cavaliers have also won the [[ACC Women's Soccer Tournament]] twice, in 2004 and 2012. The team has advanced to the [[NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA Women's soccer tournament]] thirty one times.  Their best appearance is runner up in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2018/8/16/2018_19WSoccerFactBook.pdf|title=2018 Women's Soccer Fact Book|website=virginiasports.com|publisher=University of Virginia Athletics|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\nThe Virginia Cavaliers women's soccer team was founded in 1985 with head coach Dan Beshoar.  The team went 10\u20138\u20130 in their inaugural season and did not play in a conference.  The University of Virginia was a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], but the conference did not begin to sponsor women's soccer until 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title=ACC Women's Soccer Annual Champions & Composite Records |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/w-soccer/auto_pdf/acc-records.pdf |publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>  Beshoar would only coach one season and [[Lauren Gregg]] would take over in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lauren Gregg|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/women/gregg.htm|publisher=Soccer Times|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> In her first season, the Cavaliers finished with their only non-winning record in program history.  An 8\u20138\u20132 record was still .500, however.  In 1987 the team made its first [[NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA Women's soccer tournament]], falling in the first round.  1988 was the inaugural season of the [[ACC Women's Soccer Tournament]].  The Cavaliers qualified, and fell in the first round.  However, they made it all the way to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.  The decade closed with repeat performances in both the ACC and NCAA tournaments, but and improvement to 16 overall wins, from 14 in the previous season.\n\n===1990s===\nGregg's successful run continued into the 90s, as the Cavaliers began the decade with an 18 win season, finished runners up in the ACC Tournament, and made the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.  Their 18\u20133\u20130 record was a program best for wins that would stand until 2013.  The Cavaliers had continued success in 1991 as they made the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament.  1993 proved to be a difficult season, in relative terms, for the team.  Their 10\u20139\u20132 record was the second worst by winning percentage in team history.  It was also only the third time in the team's history they did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament.  The Cavaliers would turn it around quickly however, finishing 1994 with 4 conference wins, 13 overall wins, and a return to the NCAA Tournament.  1994 was the start of a string of 25 straight NCAA appearances for the team.  After a very similar 1995 season, Gregg would retire as head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/14622/college-gregg-leaves-virginia.html|title=College: Gregg leaves Virginia|website=socceramerica.com|publisher=Soccer America|date=January 1, 1995|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>  Prior to the 1996 season, it was announced that [[April Heinrichs]] would be the third coach in program history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2000-08-13-0008130010-story.html|title='Every cell in my body'|website=baltimoresun.com|publisher=Baltimore Sun|first=Mike|last=Klingman|date=August 13, 2000|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>  Heinrichs continued the team's success, winning double digit overall games in each year between 1996 and 1999.  The Cavailers also qualified for both the NCAA Tournament and ACC Tournament in those seasons.  A new team record of 5 ACC wins was set in 1998.  The team also made the NCAA Sweet 16 in 1997 and 1999.  After the 1999 season, Heinrichs left Virginia to become the coach of the [[United States women's national soccer team|US Women's National Team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/13/05/april-heinrichs-named-head-coach-of-the-u-s-womens-national-team|title=April Heinrichs Named Head Coach of the U.S. Women's National Team|website=ussoccer.com|publisher=U.S. Soccer|date=January 18, 2000|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe decade began with the hiring of Steve Swanson as the program's fourth head coach in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2000/2/10/Steve_Swanson_Named_New_Head_Coach_Of_Virginia_Women_s_Soccer.aspx?path=wsoc|title=Steve Swanson Named New Head Coach Of Virginia Women's Soccer|date=February 10, 2000|website=virginiaspors.com|publisher=University of Virginia Athletics|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref> The hiring would prove a transformative one, but Swanson got off to a slow start.  In 2000, the team won only 11 overall games, their lowest total since 1993.  However, the team did make it to the NCAA Sweet 16 for the second year in a row.  2001 proved successful with 17 total wins and a trip to the NCAA Quarterfinals.  2002 saw a lower win total of 13, but the team returned to the NCAA Round of 16.  2003 would end a run of four straight years making the NCAA Round of 16.  The Cavaliers lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament and won 12 games overall.  In 2004, the team won their first ever ACC Tournament Championship.  This post-season luck did not carry forward to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round.  The team tied a then-program best win total of 18 in 2005, finished runners up in the ACC Tournament and returned to the Quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament.  The 2005 season began a run of 14 straight season where the Cavaliers made at least the NCAA Round of 16.  However, ACC Tournament success would not follow, as the team never made it past the second round from 2006-2011.  The team closed the decade with a 10 win season in 2009.\n\n===2010s===\nThe Cavaliers won an increasing number of games each year between 2010 and 2013.  This improvement streak began with a solid 15 wins, and 7 conference wins in 2000.  Additionally, the Cavaliers extended their streak of making at least the NCAA Round of 16.  2011 would be the team's fourth ever NCAA Quarterfinals appearance.  2012 saw the Cavaliers win their second ACC Tournament, tie their program record for overall wins at 18, and make the NCAA Sweet 16.  2013 and 2014 would be the two best years in program history.  In 2013, the Cavaliers had a perfect ACC season, finishing 13\u20130\u20130 and winning the regular season title.  They would also make the NCAA Semifinals for the first time in since 1991.  In 2014, they finished runners up in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  To follow that up, they again finished runners up in the ACC Tournament in 2015.  However, they fell one win short of a third straight year of 20 overall wins.  The program could not quite repeat those highs from 2016-2018.  However, the team did finish with double digit wins and NCAA Sweet 16 appearances in each of those seasons.\n\n==Seasons==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=3| Season\n!rowspan=3| Head coach\n!colspan=6| Season result<ref>{{harvnb|2018 Fact Book|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n!colspan=2| Tournament results\n|-\n!colspan=3| Overall\n!colspan=3| Conference\n!rowspan=2| Conference\n!rowspan=2| NCAA\n|-\n!

The team has won two regular season conference championships, in 2013 and 2015. The Cavaliers have also won the [[ACC Women's Soccer Tournament]] twice, in 2004 and 2012. The team has advanced to the [[NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA Women's soccer tournament]] thirty one times.  Their best appearance is runner up in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2018/8/16/2018_19WSoccerFactBook.pdf|title=2018 Women's Soccer Fact Book|website=virginiasports.com|publisher=University of Virginia Athletics|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\nThe Virginia Cavaliers women's soccer team was founded in 1985 with head coach Dan Beshoar.  The team went 10\u20138\u20130 in their inaugural season and did not play in a conference.  The University of Virginia was a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], but the conference did not begin to sponsor women's soccer until 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title=ACC Women's Soccer Annual Champions & Composite Records |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/w-soccer/auto_pdf/acc-records.pdf |publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>  Beshoar would only coach one season and [[Lauren Gregg]] would take over in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lauren Gregg|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/women/gregg.htm|publisher=Soccer Times|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> In her first season, the Cavaliers finished with their only non-winning record in program history.  An 8\u20138\u20132 record was still .500, however.  In 1987 the team made its first [[NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA Women's soccer tournament]], falling in the first round.  1988 was the inaugural season of the [[ACC Women's Soccer Tournament]].  The Cavaliers qualified, and fell in the first round.  However, they made it all the way to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.  The decade closed with repeat performances in both the ACC and NCAA tournaments, but and improvement to 16 overall wins, from 14 in the previous season.\n\n===1990s===\nGregg's successful run continued into the 90s, as the Cavaliers began the decade with an 18 win season, finished runners up in the ACC Tournament, and made the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.  Their 18\u20133\u20130 record was a program best for wins that would stand until 2013.  The Cavaliers had continued success in 1991 as they made the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament.  1993 proved to be a difficult season, in relative terms, for the team.  Their 10\u20139\u20132 record was the second worst by winning percentage in team history.  It was also only the third time in the team's history they did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament.  The Cavaliers would turn it around quickly however, finishing 1994 with 4 conference wins, 13 overall wins, and a return to the NCAA Tournament.  1994 was the start of a string of 25 straight NCAA appearances for the team.  After a very similar 1995 season, Gregg would retire as head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/14622/college-gregg-leaves-virginia.html|title=College: Gregg leaves Virginia|website=socceramerica.com|publisher=Soccer America|date=January 1, 1995|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>  Prior to the 1996 season, it was announced that [[April Heinrichs]] would be the third coach in program history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2000-08-13-0008130010-story.html|title='Every cell in my body'|website=baltimoresun.com|publisher=Baltimore Sun|first=Mike|last=Klingman|date=August 13, 2000|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>  Heinrichs continued the team's success, winning double digit overall games in each year between 1996 and 1999.  The Cavailers also qualified for both the NCAA Tournament and ACC Tournament in those seasons.  A new team record of 5 ACC wins was set in 1998.  The team also made the NCAA Sweet 16 in 1997 and 1999.  After the 1999 season, Heinrichs left Virginia to become the coach of the [[United States women's national soccer team|US Women's National Team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/13/05/april-heinrichs-named-head-coach-of-the-u-s-womens-national-team|title=April Heinrichs Named Head Coach of the U.S. Women's National Team|website=ussoccer.com|publisher=U.S. Soccer|date=January 18, 2000|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe decade began with the hiring of Steve Swanson as the program's fourth head coach in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2000/2/10/Steve_Swanson_Named_New_Head_Coach_Of_Virginia_Women_s_Soccer.aspx?path=wsoc|title=Steve Swanson Named New Head Coach Of Virginia Women's Soccer|date=February 10, 2000|website=virginiaspors.com|publisher=University of Virginia Athletics|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref> The hiring would prove a transformative one, but Swanson got off to a slow start.  In 2000, the team won only 11 overall games, their lowest total since 1993.  However, the team did make it to the NCAA Sweet 16 for the second year in a row.  2001 proved successful with 17 total wins and a trip to the NCAA Quarterfinals.  2002 saw a lower win total of 13, but the team returned to the NCAA Round of 16.  2003 would end a run of four straight years making the NCAA Round of 16.  The Cavaliers lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament and won 12 games overall.  In 2004, the team won their first ever ACC Tournament Championship.  This post-season luck did not carry forward to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round.  The team tied a then-program best win total of 18 in 2005, finished runners up in the ACC Tournament and returned to the Quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament.  The 2005 season began a run of 14 straight season where the Cavaliers made at least the NCAA Round of 16.  However, ACC Tournament success would not follow, as the team never made it past the second round from 2006-2011.  The team closed the decade with a 10 win season in 2009.\n\n===2010s===\nThe Cavaliers won an increasing number of games each year between 2010 and 2013.  This improvement streak began with a solid 15 wins, and 7 conference wins in 2000.  Additionally, the Cavaliers extended their streak of making at least the NCAA Round of 16.  2011 would be the team's fourth ever NCAA Quarterfinals appearance.  2012 saw the Cavaliers win their second ACC Tournament, tie their program record for overall wins at 18, and make the NCAA Sweet 16.  2013 and 2014 would be the two best years in program history.  In 2013, the Cavaliers had a perfect ACC season, finishing 13\u20130\u20130 and winning the regular season title.  They would also make the NCAA Semifinals for the first time in since 1991.  In 2014, they finished runners up in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  To follow that up, they again finished runners up in the ACC Tournament in 2015.  However, they fell one win short of a third straight year of 20 overall wins.  The program could not quite repeat those highs from 2016-2018.  However, the team did finish with double digit wins and NCAA Sweet 16 appearances in each of those seasons.\n\n==Seasons==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=3| Season\n!rowspan=3| Head coach\n!colspan=6| Season result<ref>{{harvnb|2018 Fact Book|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n!colspan=2| Tournament results\n|-\n!colspan=3| Overall\n!colspan=3| Conference\n!rowspan=2| Conference\n!rowspan=2| NCAA\n|-\n!
