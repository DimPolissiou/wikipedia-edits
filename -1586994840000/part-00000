In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com The Friends of Hull General Cemetery], was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nIn 2018  a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from it's slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquility almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deterioted to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flauna and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city envrionment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the marvelous input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nIn 2018  a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from it's slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquility almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deterioted to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flauna and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city envrionment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the marvelous input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

In her first three months in office, she faced strikes by labor unions as the city's transit workers, public school teachers and firefighters all went on strike. She effectively banned handgun possession for guns unregistered or purchased after the enactment of an ordinance instituting a two-year re-registration program. Byrne used special events, such as [[ChicagoFest]], to revitalize Navy Pier and the downtown Chicago Theatre. Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] for president in 1980, but incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Illinois Democratic Primary and even carried Cook County and the city of Chicago. Simultaneously, Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party's candidate for Cook County State's Attorney (chief local prosecutor), 14th Ward Alderman [[Edward M.

William Blair, Chicago's fire commissioner, had ordered the [[Chicago Fire Department]] to stop Goodwin by directing a full-power fire hose at him and by using fire axes to break window glass in Goodwin's path. Mayor Byrne rushed to the scene and ordered the fire department to stand down. Then, through a smashed out 38th floor window, she told Goodwin, who was hanging from the building's side a floor below, that though she did not agree with his climbing of the John Hancock Center, she certainly opposed the fire department knocking him to the ground below.

In her first three months in office, she faced strikes by labor unions as the city's transit workers, public school teachers and firefighters all went on strike.

Byrne used special events, such as [[ChicagoFest]], to revitalize Navy Pier and the downtown Chicago Theatre. Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] for president in 1980, but incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Illinois Democratic Primary and even carried Cook County and the city of Chicago. Simultaneously, Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party's candidate for Cook County State's Attorney (chief local prosecutor), 14th Ward Alderman [[Edward M.

Mayor Byrne rushed to the scene and ordered the fire department to stand down. Then, through a smashed out 38th floor window, she told Goodwin, who was hanging from the building's side a floor below, that though she did not agree with his climbing of the John Hancock Center, she certainly opposed the fire department knocking him to the ground below.

The [[Mystic River Bascule Bridge]] crosses the river in the center of the village.  According to the Mystic River Historical Society, the name \"Mystic\" is derived from the Pequot term \"missi-tuk\", describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind. The population was 4,205 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Mystic CDP, Connecticut| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Pequot War|Mystic massacre}}\n{{One source|section|date=September 2016}}\nBefore the 17th century, the [[Pequot people]]<ref>For many years, historians believed that they migrated in the 16th century from eastern New York. Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> lived in this portion of southeastern [[Connecticut]]. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

The [[Mystic River Bascule Bridge]] crosses the river in the center of the village.  According to the Mystic River Historical Society, the name \"Mystic\" is derived from the Pequot term \"missi-tuk\", describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind. The population was 4,205 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Mystic CDP, Connecticut| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Pequot War|Mystic massacre}}\n{{One source|section|date=September 2016}}\nBefore the 17th century, the [[Pequot people]]<ref>For many years, historians believed that they migrated in the 16th century from eastern New York. Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> lived in this portion of southeastern [[Connecticut]]. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

At age 35, he established a permanent studio at [[Den Haag]] (The Hague). Crenshaw tells (and mentions the sources) that van Goyen's landscape paintings rarely fetched high prices, but he made up for the modest value of individual pieces by increasing his production, painting thinly and quickly with a limited palette of inexpensive pigments. Despite his market innovations, he always sought more income, not only through related work as an art dealer and auctioneer but also by speculating in tulips and real estate. Although the latter was usually a safe avenue of investing money, in van Goyen's experience it led to enormous debts. [[Paulus Potter]] rented one of his houses.

He died in 1656 in The Hague, still unbelievably 18,000 guilders in debt, forcing his widow to sell their remaining furniture and paintings. Van Goyen's troubles also may have affected the early business prospects of his student and son-in-law [[Jan Steen]], who left The Hague in 1654.<ref>Crenshaw, P. (2006) Rembrandt's Bankruptcy.

[[Hallwyl Museum]].]]\nTypically, a Dutch painter of the 17th century (also known as the [[Dutch Golden Age]]) will fall into one of four categories, a painter of [[portrait]]s, [[Landscape art|landscape]]s, [[still-life]]s, or [[genre]].  Dutch painting was highly specialized and rarely could an artist hope to achieve greatness in more than one area in a lifetime of painting. Jan van Goyen would be classified primarily as a landscape artist with an eye for the genre subjects of everyday life. He painted many of the canals in and around Den Haag as well as the villages surrounding countryside of [[Delft]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. Other popular Dutch landscape painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth century were\n[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Hendrick Avercamp]], [[Ludolf Backhuysen]], [[Meindert Hobbema]], [[Aert van der Neer]].\n\n==Van Goyen's technique==\n[[File:Goyen 1644c Fishing Boats in an Estuary at Dusk.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fishing Boats in an Estuary at Dusk, 1644]]\nJan van Goyen would begin a painting using a support primarily of thin oak wood. To this panel, he would scrub on several layers of a thin animal [[Animal glue|hide glue]]. With a blade, he would then scrape over the entire surface a thin layer of tinted white lead to act as a [[ground (drawing surface)|ground]] and to fill the low areas of the panel. The ground was tinted light brown, sometimes reddish, or ochre in colour.\n\n[[File:Goyen 1651 Voetbrug met hengelaars.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Typical Dutch bridge with anglers, 1651, [[Groninger Museum]]]]\n\nNext, van Goyen would loosely and very rapidly sketch out the scene to be painted with pen and ink without going into the small details of his subject. This [[walnut ink]] drawing can be clearly seen in some of the thinly painted areas of his work. For a guide, he would have turned to a detailed drawing. The scene would have been drawn from life outdoors and then kept in the studio as reference material. Drawings by artists of the time were rarely works of art in their own right as they are viewed today.\n\nOn his palette he would grind out a colour collection of neutral grays, umbers, ochre and earthen greens that looked like they were pulled from the very soil he painted. A [[Jacques Maroger|varnish oil medium]] was used as vehicle to grind his powered pigments into paint and then used to help apply thin layers of paint which he could easily blend.\n\nThe dark areas of the painting were kept very thin and transparent with generous amounts of the oil medium. The light striking the painting in these sections would be lost and absorbed into the painting ground. The lighter areas of the picture were treated heavier and opaque with a generous amount of white lead mixed into the paint. Light falling on the painting in a light section is reflected back at the viewer. The effect is a startling realism and three-dimensional quality. The surface of a finished painting resembles a fluid supple mousse, masterfully whipped and modeled with the brush. \n\nAccording to the art historian H.-U. Beck, \"In his freely composed seascapes of the 1650s he reached the apex of his creative work, producing paintings of striking perfection.\"<ref>H.-U. Beck. \"Goyen, Jan van.\" ''Grove Art Online.

He studied first under his father David de Heem the Elder (1570\u20131631), then under [[Balthasar van der Ast]]. He lived in [[Leiden]] from about 1625 to 1629, where he studied in 1629 under [[David Bailly]] (1584- c. 1657).\n\nHe moved to the [[Southern Netherlands]] and joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Antwerp in 1635 or 1636 and became a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] of that city in 1637. However he was often absent, as attested by the duties he had to pay for this.  His remarkable talent gained him a considerable reputation. He could hardly satisfy the demand. De Heem was considered one of the greatest painters of his time. He was well paid and a portrait of Prince William III surrounded by a cartouche of flowers and fruit was sold for 2000 guilders, one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting during the Dutch Golden Age.<ref name=ox/> His sons worked together with him in his workshop on the commissions for new paintings. He retouched their work and put his signature on the paintings.\n\nHe remained in Antwerp until 1667, when he moved back to Utrecht, where records trace his presence from 1668 to 1671. He left Utrecht in 1671 when French troops were approaching the city. It is not known when he finally returned to Antwerp, but his death there is recorded in the guild books.\n[[File:Jan Davidsz de Heem 002.jpg|thumb|''Vase of Flowers'', 1660,  part of Baron [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] collection.

Gold and silver cups or tankards are suggestive of the vanity of earthly possessions.  Salvation is seen allegorically as a chalice amid blossoms, and death as a crucifix in a wreath. Sometimes de Heem painted, alone or with others, [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] or [[portraits]] in garlands of fruit or flowers.\n\nHis signature varied: his initials (J.

He studied first under his father David de Heem the Elder (1570\u20131631), then under [[Balthasar van der Ast]]. He lived in [[Leiden]] from about 1625 to 1629, where he studied in 1629 under [[David Bailly]] (1584- c. 1657).\n\nHe moved to the [[Southern Netherlands]] and joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Antwerp in 1635 or 1636 and became a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] of that city in 1637. However he was often absent, as attested by the duties he had to pay for this.  His remarkable talent gained him a considerable reputation. He could hardly satisfy the demand. De Heem was considered one of the greatest painters of his time. He was well paid and a portrait of Prince William III surrounded by a cartouche of flowers and fruit was sold for 2000 guilders, one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting during the Dutch Golden Age.<ref name=ox/> His sons worked together with him in his workshop on the commissions for new paintings. He retouched their work and put his signature on the paintings.\n\nHe remained in Antwerp until 1667, when he moved back to Utrecht, where records trace his presence from 1668 to 1671. He left Utrecht in 1671 when French troops were approaching the city. It is not known when he finally returned to Antwerp, but his death there is recorded in the guild books.\n[[File:Jan Davidsz de Heem 002.jpg|thumb|''Vase of Flowers'', 1660,  part of Baron [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] collection.

Gold and silver cups or tankards are suggestive of the vanity of earthly possessions.  Salvation is seen allegorically as a chalice amid blossoms, and death as a crucifix in a wreath. Sometimes de Heem painted, alone or with others, [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] or [[portraits]] in garlands of fruit or flowers.\n\nHis signature varied: his initials (J.
