{"title_page": "General Register Office for England and Wales", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\nThe '''General Register Office for England and Wales''' (GRO) is the section of the United Kingdom [[HM Passport Office]] responsible for the [[civil registration]] of births (including [[stillbirth]]s), adoptions, marriages, [[civil partnership]]s and deaths in [[England and Wales]] and for those same events outside the UK if they involve a UK citizen and qualify to be registered in various miscellaneous registers. With a small number of historic exceptions involving military personnel, it does not deal with records of such events occurring within the land or territorial waters of [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]]; those entities' registration systems have always been separate from England and Wales.\n\nThe GRO was founded in 1836 by the [[wikisource:1836 (33) Registration of Births &c. A bill for registering Births Deaths and Marriages in England|Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836]], and civil registration commenced in 1837. Its head is the Registrar General. Probably the most distinguished person associated with the GRO in the 19th century, although he was never its head, was [[William Farr]].\n\nThe GRO supplies copies of birth, marriage, [[civil partnership]] certificates and death certificates, either online or from one of the local [[register office]]s that act on behalf of the GRO.\n\n==History of the GRO==\n\n===Establishment===\nPrior to the creation of the General Register Office (GRO) in 1837, there was no national system of civil registration in England and Wales. Baptisms, marriages and burials were recorded in parish registers maintained by [[Church of England]] (Anglican) clergy. However, with the great increase in nonconformity and the gradual relaxation of the laws against [[Catholics]] and other [[dissenters]] from the late 17th century, more and more baptisms, marriages and burials were going unrecorded in the registers of the Anglican Church.\n\nThe increasingly poor state of English parish registration led to numerous attempts to shore up the system in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The Marriage Act of 1753 attempted to prevent 'clandestine' marriages by imposing a standard form of entry for marriages, which had to be signed by both parties to the marriage and by witnesses. Additionally, except in the case of Jews and Quakers, legal marriages had to be carried out according to the rites of the Church of England. [[Sir George Rose]]'s [[Parochial Registers Act of 1812]] laid down that all events had to be entered on standard entries in bound volumes. It also declared that the church registers of Nonconformists were not admissible in court as evidence of births, marriages and deaths. Only those maintained by the clergy of the Church of England could be presented in court as legal documents, and this caused considerable hardship for Nonconformists. A number of proposals were presented to Parliament to set up centralised registries for recording vital events in the 1820s but none came to fruition.<ref>Higgs, E. ''Registration before civil registration'' at http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20kind%29&active=yes&mno=2088 Retrieved 18 August 2013</ref>\n\nEventually, increasing concern that the poor registration of baptisms, marriages and burials undermined property rights, by making it difficult to establish lines of descent, coupled with the complaints of Nonconformists, led to the establishment in 1833 of a parliamentary [[Select committees of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] on Parochial Registration. This took evidence on the state of the parochial system of registration, and made proposals that were eventually incorporated into the 1836 Registration and Marriage Acts. In addition, the government wanted to survey matters such as infant mortality, fertility and literacy to bring about improvements in health and social welfare. The medical establishment advocated this because a rapidly growing population in the northern industrial towns \u2013 caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]] \u2013 had created severe overcrowding, and the links between poor living conditions and short life expectancy were now known.\n\nThe answer was the establishment of a civil registration system. It was hoped that improved registration of vital events would protect property rights through the more accurate recording of lines of descent. Civil registration would also remove the need for Nonconformists to rely upon the Church of England for registration, and provide medical data for research.<ref name=\":0\">Higgs, E. ''The early development of the General Register Office at http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20kind%29&active=yes&mno=2002 Retrieved 18 August 2013''</ref> As a result, in 1836, legislation was passed that ordered the civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales. This took effect from 1 July 1837. A General Register Office was set up in London and the office of Registrar General was established.\n\nEngland and Wales were divided into 619 [[registration district]]s (623 from 1851), each under the supervision of a [[superintendent registrar]]. The districts were based on the recently introduced [[poor law union]]s. The registration districts were further divided into sub-districts (there could be two or more), each under the charge of registrars who were appointed locally.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the GRO was not specifically established to undertake statistical research, the early Registrar Generals, [[Thomas Henry Lister]] (1836\u201342) and George Graham (1842\u201379), built up a Statistical Department to compile medical, public health and actuarial statistics. Much of this work was undertaken in the early to mid-Victorian period by William Farr, the GRO's Superintendent of Statistics. Under these men the Annual reports of the Registrar General became a vehicle for administrative and social reform. In 1840 the GRO also took over responsibility for the decennial [[Census in the United Kingdom|census of England and Wales]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1871, the GRO came under the supervision of the [[Local Government Board]]. During the [[First World War]] the GRO was responsible for co-ordinating National Registration, which underpinned recruitment to the armed forces, the movement of workers into the munitions industries, and rationing. National Registration was not, however, continued after the war and the GRO was absorbed into the Ministry of Health in 1919.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Departmental responsibility===\nIn 1970 the GRO became part of the newly created [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]] (OPCS), with the Registrar General in overall charge. Until then it had had several statistical functions, including the conduct of population censuses and the production of annual population estimates; all these were moved elsewhere within the new organisation. The GRO then became a division within OPCS, headed by a Deputy Registrar General.  Then in 1996 the OPCS, and therefore the GRO, became part of the newly created [[Office for National Statistics]], and the office of Registrar General was merged with that of Head of the [[Government Statistical Service]].\n\n====Becoming part of the Home Office====\nOn 1 April 2008, the General Register Office for England and Wales (GRO) became a subsidiary of the [[Identity and Passport Service]] (IPS), then an executive agency of the [[Home Office]]. The decision to make the transfer of GRO to IPS was finalised following the outcome of the [[Comprehensive Spending Review]] in 2007. The move followed changes to make Office for National Statistics (ONS) more independent of the British Government, which included relinquishing the registration role.\n\nIn 2013, IPS was renamed [[HM Passport Office]], while remaining an agency of the Home Office.\n\n===Location===\nFrom its beginnings in 1836, the General Register Office was based within the North Wing of [[Somerset House]] in London.<ref>http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/history/the-great-institutions Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref> There it remained until 1970 when it moved within London to [[St Catherine's House]] on [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]. For a short time after the move the death records were stored at [[Alexandra House]], until room was found for all the records at St Catherine's House. In 1997 the GRO staff were moved to [[Southport]], Merseyside while public access to the records and indexes was made available at a new Family Records Centre (FRC) in [[Clerkenwell]]. This facility was jointly operated by the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] so that public access to census returns was also available at the same location. The FRC was closed in 2008, in response to steadily decreasing visitor numbers caused by the increased online availability of the records.\n\nThe GRO is now located at [[Smedley Hydro]] in Southport,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/doors-open-to-175-years-of-history|title=Doors open to 175 years of history|last=|first=|date=10 September 2012|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> a former [[Hydropathic Hotel|hydropathic hotel]] that has been converted into offices for the GRO and the NHS Information Centre, formerly the NHS Central Register.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/news/southport-news/patient-records-held-southports-smedley-6629325|title=Patient records held at Southport's Smedley Hydro taken on by NHS|last=|first=|date=22 April 2008|work=Southport Visiter|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The GRO registration process==\n\n=== Births ===\nIn the early days of the system, it was up to each local registrar to find out what births, marriages and deaths had taken place in his sub-district. It has therefore been estimated that only about 50\u201360% of births, both legitimate and illegitimate, were registered as parents were not legally obliged to inform the registrar. It has been estimated that in some parts of England up to 15% of births were not registered between 1837 and 1875.<ref>Herber M, (2008) ''Ancestral Trails'', (2nd Ed.) The History Press p. 55 {{ISBN|978-0-7509-4198-3}}</ref> As a result of the [[Births and Deaths Act 1874]], registration was made compulsory from 1875 and the onus was now on parents to inform the registrar when they had a child and penalties were imposed on those who failed to register. Births had to be registered within 42 days at the district or sub-district office, usually by the mother or father. If more days had elapsed but it was less than three months since the birth, the superintendent registrar had to be present and if between three months and a year, the registration could only be authorised by the Registrar General.\n\nUntil 1926, there were no registrations at all of still born children. For illegitimate children, the original 1836 legislation provided that \"it shall not be necessary to register the name of any father of a bastard child.\" From 1850, instructions to registrars were clarified to state that, \"No putative father is allowed to sign an entry in the character of 'Father'.\" However, the law was changed again 1875 to allow a father of an illegitimate child to record his name on his child's birth certificate if he attended the register office with the mother. In 1953 a child father could also be recorded on the birth certificate, if not married to the mother, without being physically present to sign the register.\n\n===Marriages===\nClergy of the established Church of England are registrars for marriage. In each parish church two identical registers of marriages are kept and when they are complete, one is sent to the superintendent registrar. In the meantime, every three months it is required that a return certified by a clergy person detailing the marriages that had taken place, or else that no marriages had taken place, in the preceding three months, be submitted directly to the superintendent registrar.\n\nThe [[Marriage Act 1836]] also permitted marriages by licence to take place in approved churches, chapels and nonconformist meeting houses, other than those of the Church of England. Marriages were only legally binding if they were notified to the superintendent registrar by the officiating minister so in effect, this required the presence of a local registration officer as the authorising person. When a nonconformist minister or other religious official, such as a rabbi, performed the ceremony it was necessary for the local registrar or his assistant to be present so that the marriage was legal. This legalisation was not repealed until 1898, after which date, nonconformist ministers and other religious leaders could take on the role of notifying official, if so appointed, and on the condition that their premises were licensed for the solemnising of marriage. The civil authorities, i.e. the local registrar, could also perform marriage by certificate in a register office. Changes in marriage laws since 1836 have also affected how marriages are registered, for example, civil partnerships for same-sex couples were introduced by the British Government in 2004 and the GRO records these ceremonies through its civil registration system.\n\n===Deaths===\nA death was to be registered by someone who had been present at the death or during the final illness.  If that wasn't possible, it could be registered by the owner of the building the person died in, or if the dead person was the owner, by some other occupier of the building.  There were more complicated arrangements for eventualities such as unidentified bodies being found, and cases where there was a coroner's inquest.  A death was supposed to be registered within eight days.<ref>An Act for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England, section XXV http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4044</ref>\n\nSince there wasn't necessarily a unique person clearly responsible for registering a death, in order to make sure deaths were registered, clergymen were made responsible for checking the death certificate before performing any funeral or burial service.  However, they were given some leeway in case the death hadn't been registered yet, and could go ahead with the service provided they notified the registrar themselves within seven days.  If they failed to do so they were liable for a ten-pound fine.<ref>An Act for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England, section XXVII http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4044</ref>  This was inadequate to guarantee all deaths were registered, since in principle a body could be buried without a religious service, and those who hadn't been baptized (mostly young children) didn't qualify for Christian burial.\n\nFrom 1845 the cause of death had to be certified by a doctor before registration.  A death would normally be registered in the district in which it occurred. Once a death has been registered, the registrar would normally issue a Certificate for Burial or Cremation, unless the death were being investigated by the [[coroner]] or there were an inquest. This certificate would give permission for the body to be buried or for an application for cremation to be made.\n\nThe [[Births and Deaths Act 1874]] tried to ensure all deaths were registered, by placing a duty on the persons who were supposed to register the death to do so.  No specific penalty was imposed if they failed to do it, but if the registrar became aware of any deaths that hadn't been registered within the past year, then the registrar had a duty and was empowered to summon the negligent parties to the register office to get it registered.  If the death had occurred more than a year previously, it wasn't to be registered late without special permission.<ref>An Act to amend the Law relating to the Registration of Births and Deaths in England, and to consolidate the Law respecting the Registration of Births and Deaths at Sea.  7 August 1874. http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)/1874&active=yes&mno=4055</ref>\n\nA different registration system operates today in other parts of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==The GRO indexes==\nEvery three months, at the end of March, June, September and December, the superintendent registrars send a copy of each entry of birth, marriage and death registered by their office in that quarter, to the Registrar General in London. From these returns the General Register Office produced indexes to its records which are open to public inspection and the indexes can be used to order birth, marriage and death certificates.\n\nWith the exception of some extra details recorded on death certificates since 1969, the information given on certificates of birth, marriage and death has not changed since 1837, but the amount of information given in the index volumes has increased from time to time. Up until 1983, the copies received by the Registrar General were bound into volumes and three separate alphabetical indexes were prepared on a quarterly basis. The number of volumes depends on the number of people registered in each quarter. Thus there may be 10 volumes for some quarters \u2013 Vol.1 A-B, Vol.2 C-D, Vol.3 E-G and so on. From their inception, the alphabetical indexes give the surname, the forenames if registered, the registration district and the volume and the page on which the entry may be found. These details enable the appropriate record to be located. Before 1866, the indexes were written by hand on heavy parchment, though some have been replaced by printed copies. From 1984, the indexes are in annual instead of quarterly volumes from 1984. The indexes from 1984 give the month of registration as the first and second digits in the document reference number. The next two digits give the year. Thus the reference number 0485 9 2128 refers to an event registered in April 1985. From 1860 the GRO death index specifies an age of death and from 1911 the birth index also specifies the maiden name of a child's mother.\n\nThe GRO indexes are major tool for persons tracing their family history as well as those needing duplicate copies of their own birth or marriage certificates. The indexes can be viewed on microfiche at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]], major libraries, county record officers, [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|LDS Family History Centres]] and can also be searched on a pay-per-view basis on several family history websites. A free, searchable index, can be consulted online on the FreeBMD website (see [[#External links|External links]]). This is an ongoing project to transcribe the whole GRO Index.\n\nThere is also the [http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp GRO Index], an index of births from 1837 to 1915, and deaths from 1837 to 1957. Unlike the indexes available elsewhere, it contains the mother's maiden name (for births) and the age of death (for deaths) for all years.\n\nOther parts of the United Kingdom have their own indexing system.\n\n===Other registers and indexes===\nIn addition to the registers already mentioned, the GRO has charge of a number of other records in its Overseas Section. These indexes can be searched online at pay-per-view family history websites and at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. They generally contain similar information to the main GRO indexes and registers. The Regimental Registers, Chaplains Returns, Consular Returns, Army Births, Marriages and Deaths and the War Deaths are some of the most significant. The civil registration records that pertain to British people in India and countries in the Far East, formerly part of the [[British Empire]], are found in the Oriental and India Office Collections of the [[British Library]].\n\n==GRO certificates and their content==\nUsing the information obtained from the GRO Index it is possible to obtain a certificate online from the certificate ordering service: http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/\n\nThe GRO currently charge \u00a311 for each certificate of birth, marriage or death, although a more expensive premium service is available for those who need copies of documents quickly. GRO certificates are used as a source by family historians to trace ancestry as well as being used for official purposes like applying for a passport.\n\n'''Birth certificates''' issued by the GRO are printed on a red form and contain the following information:\n* the registration district and sub-district;\n* the entry number;\n* the name of the child (if already bestowed);\n* the date and place of birth;\n* the sex;\n* the name of the father;\n* the name and maiden name of the mother;\n* and the profession or occupation of the father;\n* the name, address and position of the informant (e.g. mother)\n* the date of registration and the name of the registrar\n* a name given after registration e.g. if they were given a different name after baptism if within 12 months of the birth being registered.\n'''Marriage certificates''' issued by the GRO are printed on a green form and give the following information:\n* the date and place of solemnisation of the marriage;\n* the names, addresses and condition (e.g. bachelor or widower) of both the bride and groom; \n* the rank or profession of both their fathers;\n* the name of at least two witnesses and the officiating minister or registrar;\n* whether the marriage was by banns, licence or registrar's certificate.\n'''Death certificates''' issues by the GRO are printed on a black and purple form and give the following information:\n* the registration district and sub-district\n* the entry number;\n* name of the deceased, their supposed age at death and occupation\n* the cause of death\n* date and place of death\n* the informant and their relationship to the deceased\n* the name of the registrar;\n* from 1969 death certificates also record the date and place of birth of the deceased and, if applicable, the maiden name of a woman.\n\nCertificates issued in other parts of the United Kingdom contain different or additional information and have a different format.\n\nCertificates issued by the GRO clearly state that they are only certified copies (not original documents), that they are not evidence of a person's identity, and that there are criminal offences relating the unlawful amendment or falsification of a certificate, or using or possessing a false certificate. Certificates contain the seal of the General Register Office and show an abridged version of the Royal Coat of Arms.\n\n===EU flag controversy===\nIn August 2013 there were news reports suggesting that under EU legislation, English and Welsh certificates would in future have to show the flag of the European Union instead of the Royal coat of arms.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2388384/EU-flag-set-replace-royal-crest-British-birth-certificates-despite-ministers-bid-block-move.html Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref> However, the European Union stated in subsequent news reports that such changes were \"optional\" and there were allegations made that the original story had been leaked for political purposes by a British government minister's adviser to stir up hostility to the European Union in right-wing newspapers.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/10/eric-pickles-eu-flag-replace-royal-crest  Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref>\n\n==Digitisation and Indexing (D&I) Project==\nA project, called DoVE (Digitisation of Vital Events), to digitise the GRO's records of [[vital record|birth, marriage and death]] was initiated in 2005. Implementation of the project was outsourced to [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services]] in a three-year contract which expired at the end of July 2008. The process of [[image scanning|scanning]], [[digitizing|digitising]] and indexing suffered severe delays, with only (roughly) half the records delivered by the end of the contract period. By mutual agreement between the IPS and Siemens, the contract was not extended. Digitisation of birth records up to 1934 and death records up to 1957 had been completed when the contract ended.\n\nThe records that have been digitised \u2013 over 130 million of them \u2013 form part of a system (called EAGLE, for \"Electronic Access to GRO Legacy Events\") which is used within the GRO to fulfil requests for certificates from the general public. A different system, known as MAGPIE (\"MultiAccess to GRO Public Index of Events\"), was intended to make the indexes available to the public via a website, but this will not now be implemented. Instead, following a lengthy review of options, a new project, called the Digitisation and Indexing (D&I) Project, was initiated.\n\nThe D&I Project was planned to: complete the digitisation of birth, marriage and death records; create an online index to those records; and improve the certificate ordering process.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03709.pdf|title= Digitisation of civil registration records|first= Catherine|last= Fairbairn|date=  4 May 2010|publisher= [[House of Commons Library]]|location= London|format= PDF|accessdate= 19 May 2011}}</ref> In September 2010 this project was suspended pending the outcome of the latest UK Government [[Comprehensive Spending Review]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/|url-status= dead|title= Modernising civil registration|year= 2011|publisher= [[Home Office]]|location= London|archiveurl= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110412211553/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/| archivedate= 12 April 2011|accessdate= 9 August 2012}}</ref> The IPS expected to reach a decision on the future of the digitisation project during financial year 2011/12,<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/|url-status= dead|title= Modernising civil registration|date=November 2011|publisher= [[Home Office]]|location= London|archiveurl= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120408154315/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/| archivedate= 8 April 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}}</ref> but in August 2012 it was announced that \"there are no current plans to resume this work\".

With a small number of historic exceptions involving military personnel, it does not deal with records of such events occurring within the land or territorial waters of [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]]; those entities' registration systems have always been separate from England and Wales.\n\nThe GRO was founded in 1836 by the [[wikisource:1836 (33) Registration of Births &c. A bill for registering Births Deaths and Marriages in England|Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836]], and civil registration commenced in 1837. Its head is the Registrar General. Probably the most distinguished person associated with the GRO in the 19th century, although he was never its head, was [[William Farr]].\n\nThe GRO supplies copies of birth, marriage, [[civil partnership]] certificates and death certificates, either online or from one of the local [[register office]]s that act on behalf of the GRO.\n\n==History of the GRO==\n\n===Establishment===\nPrior to the creation of the General Register Office (GRO) in 1837, there was no national system of civil registration in England and Wales. Baptisms, marriages and burials were recorded in parish registers maintained by [[Church of England]] (Anglican) clergy. However, with the great increase in nonconformity and the gradual relaxation of the laws against [[Catholics]] and other [[dissenters]] from the late 17th century, more and more baptisms, marriages and burials were going unrecorded in the registers of the Anglican Church.\n\nThe increasingly poor state of English parish registration led to numerous attempts to shore up the system in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The Marriage Act of 1753 attempted to prevent 'clandestine' marriages by imposing a standard form of entry for marriages, which had to be signed by both parties to the marriage and by witnesses. Additionally, except in the case of Jews and Quakers, legal marriages had to be carried out according to the rites of the Church of England. [[Sir George Rose]]'s [[Parochial Registers Act of 1812]] laid down that all events had to be entered on standard entries in bound volumes. It also declared that the church registers of Nonconformists were not admissible in court as evidence of births, marriages and deaths. Only those maintained by the clergy of the Church of England could be presented in court as legal documents, and this caused considerable hardship for Nonconformists. A number of proposals were presented to Parliament to set up centralised registries for recording vital events in the 1820s but none came to fruition.<ref>Higgs, E. ''Registration before civil registration'' at http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20kind%29&active=yes&mno=2088 Retrieved 18 August 2013</ref>\n\nEventually, increasing concern that the poor registration of baptisms, marriages and burials undermined property rights, by making it difficult to establish lines of descent, coupled with the complaints of Nonconformists, led to the establishment in 1833 of a parliamentary [[Select committees of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] on Parochial Registration. This took evidence on the state of the parochial system of registration, and made proposals that were eventually incorporated into the 1836 Registration and Marriage Acts. In addition, the government wanted to survey matters such as infant mortality, fertility and literacy to bring about improvements in health and social welfare. The medical establishment advocated this because a rapidly growing population in the northern industrial towns \u2013 caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]] \u2013 had created severe overcrowding, and the links between poor living conditions and short life expectancy were now known.\n\nThe answer was the establishment of a civil registration system. It was hoped that improved registration of vital events would protect property rights through the more accurate recording of lines of descent. Civil registration would also remove the need for Nonconformists to rely upon the Church of England for registration, and provide medical data for research.<ref name=\":0\">Higgs, E. ''The early development of the General Register Office at http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20kind%29&active=yes&mno=2002 Retrieved 18 August 2013''</ref> As a result, in 1836, legislation was passed that ordered the civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales. This took effect from 1 July 1837. A General Register Office was set up in London and the office of Registrar General was established.\n\nEngland and Wales were divided into 619 [[registration district]]s (623 from 1851), each under the supervision of a [[superintendent registrar]]. The districts were based on the recently introduced [[poor law union]]s. The registration districts were further divided into sub-districts (there could be two or more), each under the charge of registrars who were appointed locally.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the GRO was not specifically established to undertake statistical research, the early Registrar Generals, [[Thomas Henry Lister]] (1836\u201342) and George Graham (1842\u201379), built up a Statistical Department to compile medical, public health and actuarial statistics. Much of this work was undertaken in the early to mid-Victorian period by William Farr, the GRO's Superintendent of Statistics. Under these men the Annual reports of the Registrar General became a vehicle for administrative and social reform. In 1840 the GRO also took over responsibility for the decennial [[Census in the United Kingdom|census of England and Wales]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1871, the GRO came under the supervision of the [[Local Government Board]]. During the [[First World War]] the GRO was responsible for co-ordinating National Registration, which underpinned recruitment to the armed forces, the movement of workers into the munitions industries, and rationing. National Registration was not, however, continued after the war and the GRO was absorbed into the Ministry of Health in 1919.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Departmental responsibility===\nIn 1970 the GRO became part of the newly created [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]] (OPCS), with the Registrar General in overall charge. Until then it had had several statistical functions, including the conduct of population censuses and the production of annual population estimates; all these were moved elsewhere within the new organisation. The GRO then became a division within OPCS, headed by a Deputy Registrar General.  Then in 1996 the OPCS, and therefore the GRO, became part of the newly created [[Office for National Statistics]], and the office of Registrar General was merged with that of Head of the [[Government Statistical Service]].\n\n====Becoming part of the Home Office====\nOn 1 April 2008, the General Register Office for England and Wales (GRO) became a subsidiary of the [[Identity and Passport Service]] (IPS), then an executive agency of the [[Home Office]]. The decision to make the transfer of GRO to IPS was finalised following the outcome of the [[Comprehensive Spending Review]] in 2007. The move followed changes to make Office for National Statistics (ONS) more independent of the British Government, which included relinquishing the registration role.\n\nIn 2013, IPS was renamed [[HM Passport Office]], while remaining an agency of the Home Office.\n\n===Location===\nFrom its beginnings in 1836, the General Register Office was based within the North Wing of [[Somerset House]] in London.<ref>http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/history/the-great-institutions Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref> There it remained until 1970 when it moved within London to [[St Catherine's House]] on [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]. For a short time after the move the death records were stored at [[Alexandra House]], until room was found for all the records at St Catherine's House. In 1997 the GRO staff were moved to [[Southport]], Merseyside while public access to the records and indexes was made available at a new Family Records Centre (FRC) in [[Clerkenwell]]. This facility was jointly operated by the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] so that public access to census returns was also available at the same location. The FRC was closed in 2008, in response to steadily decreasing visitor numbers caused by the increased online availability of the records.\n\nThe GRO is now located at [[Smedley Hydro]] in Southport,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/doors-open-to-175-years-of-history|title=Doors open to 175 years of history|last=|first=|date=10 September 2012|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> a former [[Hydropathic Hotel|hydropathic hotel]] that has been converted into offices for the GRO and the NHS Information Centre, formerly the NHS Central Register.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/news/southport-news/patient-records-held-southports-smedley-6629325|title=Patient records held at Southport's Smedley Hydro taken on by NHS|last=|first=|date=22 April 2008|work=Southport Visiter|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The GRO registration process==\n\n=== Births ===\nIn the early days of the system, it was up to each local registrar to find out what births, marriages and deaths had taken place in his sub-district. It has therefore been estimated that only about 50\u201360% of births, both legitimate and illegitimate, were registered as parents were not legally obliged to inform the registrar. It has been estimated that in some parts of England up to 15% of births were not registered between 1837 and 1875.<ref>Herber M, (2008) ''Ancestral Trails'', (2nd Ed.) The History Press p. 55 {{ISBN|978-0-7509-4198-3}}</ref> As a result of the [[Births and Deaths Act 1874]], registration was made compulsory from 1875 and the onus was now on parents to inform the registrar when they had a child and penalties were imposed on those who failed to register. Births had to be registered within 42 days at the district or sub-district office, usually by the mother or father. If more days had elapsed but it was less than three months since the birth, the superintendent registrar had to be present and if between three months and a year, the registration could only be authorised by the Registrar General.\n\nUntil 1926, there were no registrations at all of still born children. For illegitimate children, the original 1836 legislation provided that \"it shall not be necessary to register the name of any father of a bastard child.\" From 1850, instructions to registrars were clarified to state that, \"No putative father is allowed to sign an entry in the character of 'Father'.\" However, the law was changed again 1875 to allow a father of an illegitimate child to record his name on his child's birth certificate if he attended the register office with the mother. In 1953 a child father could also be recorded on the birth certificate, if not married to the mother, without being physically present to sign the register.\n\n===Marriages===\nClergy of the established Church of England are registrars for marriage. In each parish church two identical registers of marriages are kept and when they are complete, one is sent to the superintendent registrar. In the meantime, every three months it is required that a return certified by a clergy person detailing the marriages that had taken place, or else that no marriages had taken place, in the preceding three months, be submitted directly to the superintendent registrar.\n\nThe [[Marriage Act 1836]] also permitted marriages by licence to take place in approved churches, chapels and nonconformist meeting houses, other than those of the Church of England. Marriages were only legally binding if they were notified to the superintendent registrar by the officiating minister so in effect, this required the presence of a local registration officer as the authorising person. When a nonconformist minister or other religious official, such as a rabbi, performed the ceremony it was necessary for the local registrar or his assistant to be present so that the marriage was legal. This legalisation was not repealed until 1898, after which date, nonconformist ministers and other religious leaders could take on the role of notifying official, if so appointed, and on the condition that their premises were licensed for the solemnising of marriage. The civil authorities, i.e. the local registrar, could also perform marriage by certificate in a register office. Changes in marriage laws since 1836 have also affected how marriages are registered, for example, civil partnerships for same-sex couples were introduced by the British Government in 2004 and the GRO records these ceremonies through its civil registration system.\n\n===Deaths===\nA death was to be registered by someone who had been present at the death or during the final illness.  If that wasn't possible, it could be registered by the owner of the building the person died in, or if the dead person was the owner, by some other occupier of the building.  There were more complicated arrangements for eventualities such as unidentified bodies being found, and cases where there was a coroner's inquest.  A death was supposed to be registered within eight days.<ref>An Act for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England, section XXV http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4044</ref>\n\nSince there wasn't necessarily a unique person clearly responsible for registering a death, in order to make sure deaths were registered, clergymen were made responsible for checking the death certificate before performing any funeral or burial service.  However, they were given some leeway in case the death hadn't been registered yet, and could go ahead with the service provided they notified the registrar themselves within seven days.  If they failed to do so they were liable for a ten-pound fine.<ref>An Act for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England, section XXVII http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)&active=yes&mno=4044</ref>  This was inadequate to guarantee all deaths were registered, since in principle a body could be buried without a religious service, and those who hadn't been baptized (mostly young children) didn't qualify for Christian burial.\n\nFrom 1845 the cause of death had to be certified by a doctor before registration.  A death would normally be registered in the district in which it occurred. Once a death has been registered, the registrar would normally issue a Certificate for Burial or Cremation, unless the death were being investigated by the [[coroner]] or there were an inquest. This certificate would give permission for the body to be buried or for an application for cremation to be made.\n\nThe [[Births and Deaths Act 1874]] tried to ensure all deaths were registered, by placing a duty on the persons who were supposed to register the death to do so.  No specific penalty was imposed if they failed to do it, but if the registrar became aware of any deaths that hadn't been registered within the past year, then the registrar had a duty and was empowered to summon the negligent parties to the register office to get it registered.  If the death had occurred more than a year previously, it wasn't to be registered late without special permission.<ref>An Act to amend the Law relating to the Registration of Births and Deaths in England, and to consolidate the Law respecting the Registration of Births and Deaths at Sea.  7 August 1874. http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Legislation%20(by%20date)/1874&active=yes&mno=4055</ref>\n\nA different registration system operates today in other parts of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==The GRO indexes==\nEvery three months, at the end of March, June, September and December, the superintendent registrars send a copy of each entry of birth, marriage and death registered by their office in that quarter, to the Registrar General in London. From these returns the General Register Office produced indexes to its records which are open to public inspection and the indexes can be used to order birth, marriage and death certificates.\n\nWith the exception of some extra details recorded on death certificates since 1969, the information given on certificates of birth, marriage and death has not changed since 1837, but the amount of information given in the index volumes has increased from time to time. Up until 1983, the copies received by the Registrar General were bound into volumes and three separate alphabetical indexes were prepared on a quarterly basis. The number of volumes depends on the number of people registered in each quarter. Thus there may be 10 volumes for some quarters \u2013 Vol.1 A-B, Vol.2 C-D, Vol.3 E-G and so on. From their inception, the alphabetical indexes give the surname, the forenames if registered, the registration district and the volume and the page on which the entry may be found. These details enable the appropriate record to be located. Before 1866, the indexes were written by hand on heavy parchment, though some have been replaced by printed copies. From 1984, the indexes are in annual instead of quarterly volumes from 1984. The indexes from 1984 give the month of registration as the first and second digits in the document reference number. The next two digits give the year. Thus the reference number 0485 9 2128 refers to an event registered in April 1985. From 1860 the GRO death index specifies an age of death and from 1911 the birth index also specifies the maiden name of a child's mother.\n\nThe GRO indexes are major tool for persons tracing their family history as well as those needing duplicate copies of their own birth or marriage certificates. The indexes can be viewed on microfiche at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]], major libraries, county record officers, [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|LDS Family History Centres]] and can also be searched on a pay-per-view basis on several family history websites. A free, searchable index, can be consulted online on the FreeBMD website (see [[#External links|External links]]). This is an ongoing project to transcribe the whole GRO Index.\n\nThere is also the [http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp GRO Index], an index of births from 1837 to 1915, and deaths from 1837 to 1957. Unlike the indexes available elsewhere, it contains the mother's maiden name (for births) and the age of death (for deaths) for all years.\n\nOther parts of the United Kingdom have their own indexing system.\n\n===Other registers and indexes===\nIn addition to the registers already mentioned, the GRO has charge of a number of other records in its Overseas Section. These indexes can be searched online at pay-per-view family history websites and at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. They generally contain similar information to the main GRO indexes and registers. The Regimental Registers, Chaplains Returns, Consular Returns, Army Births, Marriages and Deaths and the War Deaths are some of the most significant. The civil registration records that pertain to British people in India and countries in the Far East, formerly part of the [[British Empire]], are found in the Oriental and India Office Collections of the [[British Library]].\n\n==GRO certificates and their content==\nUsing the information obtained from the GRO Index it is possible to obtain a certificate online from the certificate ordering service: http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/\n\nThe GRO currently charge \u00a311 for each certificate of birth, marriage or death, although a more expensive premium service is available for those who need copies of documents quickly. GRO certificates are used as a source by family historians to trace ancestry as well as being used for official purposes like applying for a passport.\n\n'''Birth certificates''' issued by the GRO are printed on a red form and contain the following information:\n* the registration district and sub-district;\n* the entry number;\n* the name of the child (if already bestowed);\n* the date and place of birth;\n* the sex;\n* the name of the father;\n* the name and maiden name of the mother;\n* and the profession or occupation of the father;\n* the name, address and position of the informant (e.g. mother)\n* the date of registration and the name of the registrar\n* a name given after registration e.g. if they were given a different name after baptism if within 12 months of the birth being registered.\n'''Marriage certificates''' issued by the GRO are printed on a green form and give the following information:\n* the date and place of solemnisation of the marriage;\n* the names, addresses and condition (e.g. bachelor or widower) of both the bride and groom; \n* the rank or profession of both their fathers;\n* the name of at least two witnesses and the officiating minister or registrar;\n* whether the marriage was by banns, licence or registrar's certificate.\n'''Death certificates''' issues by the GRO are printed on a black and purple form and give the following information:\n* the registration district and sub-district\n* the entry number;\n* name of the deceased, their supposed age at death and occupation\n* the cause of death\n* date and place of death\n* the informant and their relationship to the deceased\n* the name of the registrar;\n* from 1969 death certificates also record the date and place of birth of the deceased and, if applicable, the maiden name of a woman.\n\nCertificates issued in other parts of the United Kingdom contain different or additional information and have a different format.\n\nCertificates issued by the GRO clearly state that they are only certified copies (not original documents), that they are not evidence of a person's identity, and that there are criminal offences relating the unlawful amendment or falsification of a certificate, or using or possessing a false certificate. Certificates contain the seal of the General Register Office and show an abridged version of the Royal Coat of Arms.\n\n===EU flag controversy===\nIn August 2013 there were news reports suggesting that under EU legislation, English and Welsh certificates would in future have to show the flag of the European Union instead of the Royal coat of arms.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2388384/EU-flag-set-replace-royal-crest-British-birth-certificates-despite-ministers-bid-block-move.html Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref> However, the European Union stated in subsequent news reports that such changes were \"optional\" and there were allegations made that the original story had been leaked for political purposes by a British government minister's adviser to stir up hostility to the European Union in right-wing newspapers.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/10/eric-pickles-eu-flag-replace-royal-crest  Retrieved 17 August 2013</ref>\n\n==Digitisation and Indexing (D&I) Project==\nA project, called DoVE (Digitisation of Vital Events), to digitise the GRO's records of [[vital record|birth, marriage and death]] was initiated in 2005. Implementation of the project was outsourced to [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services]] in a three-year contract which expired at the end of July 2008. The process of [[image scanning|scanning]], [[digitizing|digitising]] and indexing suffered severe delays, with only (roughly) half the records delivered by the end of the contract period. By mutual agreement between the IPS and Siemens, the contract was not extended. Digitisation of birth records up to 1934 and death records up to 1957 had been completed when the contract ended.\n\nThe records that have been digitised \u2013 over 130 million of them \u2013 form part of a system (called EAGLE, for \"Electronic Access to GRO Legacy Events\") which is used within the GRO to fulfil requests for certificates from the general public. A different system, known as MAGPIE (\"MultiAccess to GRO Public Index of Events\"), was intended to make the indexes available to the public via a website, but this will not now be implemented. Instead, following a lengthy review of options, a new project, called the Digitisation and Indexing (D&I) Project, was initiated.\n\nThe D&I Project was planned to: complete the digitisation of birth, marriage and death records; create an online index to those records; and improve the certificate ordering process.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03709.pdf|title= Digitisation of civil registration records|first= Catherine|last= Fairbairn|date=  4 May 2010|publisher= [[House of Commons Library]]|location= London|format= PDF|accessdate= 19 May 2011}}</ref> In September 2010 this project was suspended pending the outcome of the latest UK Government [[Comprehensive Spending Review]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/|url-status= dead|title= Modernising civil registration|year= 2011|publisher= [[Home Office]]|location= London|archiveurl= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110412211553/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/| archivedate= 12 April 2011|accessdate= 9 August 2012}}</ref> The IPS expected to reach a decision on the future of the digitisation project during financial year 2011/12,<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/|url-status= dead|title= Modernising civil registration|date=November 2011|publisher= [[Home Office]]|location= London|archiveurl= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120408154315/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/ips/civil-registration/modernising-civil-registration/| archivedate= 8 April 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}}</ref> but in August 2012 it was announced that \"there are no current plans to resume this work\".

The hybrid model is a center based style of teaching where students rotate through three learning groups, Direct Instruction, Independent, and Collaborative. Each group can be homogeneous or heterogeneously mixed and should consist of no more than 10 students per group. These rotations last anywhere from twenty to twenty-five minutes and are used for teaching both Reading and Mathematics. In the Direct Instruction group the teacher should teach the lesson of the day as normal, but now with a smaller number of students, allowing for a more differentiated learning experience. The Collaborative group contains activities ranging from games or team work worksheets/materials that the students use as a supplemental activity to the lesson that was taught in the Direct Instruction group. The Independent group allows students to work on the computers or iPads on a program entitled IReady which individually benchmarks and targets the students individual needs in both Reading and Mathematics. \nAs of February 2016 the Hybrid Teaching Model has proven to be successful in both primary schools showing major gains in Reading and Math skills among K-2 students. Upon board approval, the Hybrid Learning Model will spread to other schools within the district in upcoming years.\n\n==Special education==\nIn December 2010, the district administration reported that 1,226 pupils or 11.9% of the district's pupils received [[Special Education]] services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/PR_AlphaList.aspx |title=Area School District Special Education Data Report LEA Performance on State Performance Plan (SPP) Targets |author=Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education Services |date=2009\u20132010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824063459/http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/PR_AlphaList.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-24 }}</ref> In 2009 the administration reported that 1,270 students (12%) received special education services.\n\nIn order to comply with state and federal [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs.

These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Procedural Safeguards Notice Hazleton Area School District Administration, January 6, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b-ssd.org/PDFs/GaskinFactSheet.pdf |title=Gaskin Settlement Agreement Overview Facts Sheet |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education, Bureau of Special Education |date=September 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020185248/http://www.b-ssd.org/PDFs/GaskinFactSheet.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasdk12.org/Page/87 |title=Hazleton Area School District Special Education information |author=Hazleton Special Education Department |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services.

A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 the Taxpayer Relief Act information |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Exceptions |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index.

In 2010 within Luzerne County, the highest amount went to [[Wilkes-Barre Area School District]] set at $210 per approved homestead. [[Dallas School District]] received $53 per homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office.  Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=pre|contiguous}} and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the [[Chester-Upland School District]] in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.<ref>Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010</ref> CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient.  In 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General released a report finding that 35% of Pennsylvania property owners did not get property tax relief in 2009. One issue identified was the failure of the property owner to apply for tax relief.<ref>Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Auditor General Office, 2-23-2010.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.\n\nProperty taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the [[Tax Foundation]], Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).<ref>New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Extracurricular Activities==\nThe district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the [[National School Lunch Act|Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act]] (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\" The Superintendent annually reports to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The policy establishes a Wellness Committee that serves as an advisory committee regarding student health issues and developed a Student Wellness Policy.\n\nThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the [http://www.pdesas.org/Standard/StandardsDownloads Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education], campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education \u2014 Division of Food and Nutrition.

The Hazleton Area School district consisted of various High Schools, such as Freeland, West Hazleton, and Hazleton. It first began when the school athletics combined to create one team, the Hazleton Area Cougars. Since 1992, The Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics school has opened, in 2013. Also, with innovative ways to improve education, the Career Center has evolved, with regular college prep courses available to take inside the Career Center, rather than walking to the High School as often.

The hybrid model is a center based style of teaching where students rotate through three learning groups, Direct Instruction, Independent, and Collaborative. Each group can be homogeneous or heterogeneously mixed and should consist of no more than 10 students per group. These rotations last anywhere from twenty to twenty-five minutes and are used for teaching both Reading and Mathematics. In the Direct Instruction group the teacher should teach the lesson of the day as normal, but now with a smaller number of students, allowing for a more differentiated learning experience. The Collaborative group contains activities ranging from games or team work worksheets/materials that the students use as a supplemental activity to the lesson that was taught in the Direct Instruction group. The Independent group allows students to work on the computers or iPads on a program entitled IReady which individually benchmarks and targets the students individual needs in both Reading and Mathematics. \nAs of February 2016 the Hybrid Teaching Model has proven to be successful in both primary schools showing major gains in Reading and Math skills among K-2 students. Upon board approval, the Hybrid Learning Model will spread to other schools within the district in upcoming years.\n\n==Special education==\nIn December 2010, the district administration reported that 1,226 pupils or 11.9% of the district's pupils received [[Special Education]] services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/PR_AlphaList.aspx |title=Area School District Special Education Data Report LEA Performance on State Performance Plan (SPP) Targets |author=Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education Services |date=2009\u20132010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824063459/http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/PR_AlphaList.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-24 }}</ref> In 2009 the administration reported that 1,270 students (12%) received special education services.\n\nIn order to comply with state and federal [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Hazleton Area School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006-2007 through 2011-2012,   May 2011.</ref>\n*2006-07 - 5.3%, Base 3.9%\n*2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4%\n*2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4%\n*2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1%\n*2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9%\n*2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4%\n*2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7%<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index Listing |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2011-12 school year, Hazleton Area School Board applied for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, Pension costs, School Construction Grandfathered Debt and Special Education Costs.

Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index.

In 2010 within Luzerne County, the highest amount went to [[Wilkes-Barre Area School District]] set at $210 per approved homestead. [[Dallas School District]] received $53 per homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office.  Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=pre|contiguous}} and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the [[Chester-Upland School District]] in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.<ref>Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010</ref> CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient.  In 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General released a report finding that 35% of Pennsylvania property owners did not get property tax relief in 2009. One issue identified was the failure of the property owner to apply for tax relief.<ref>Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Auditor General Office, 2-23-2010.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.\n\nProperty taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the [[Tax Foundation]], Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).<ref>New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Extracurricular Activities==\nThe district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports.

The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the [[National School Lunch Act|Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act]] (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\" The Superintendent annually reports to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The policy establishes a Wellness Committee that serves as an advisory committee regarding student health issues and developed a Student Wellness Policy.\n\nThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the [http://www.pdesas.org/Standard/StandardsDownloads Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education], campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education \u2014 Division of Food and Nutrition.

Brazilian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who last played for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Desportiva Perilima|AD Perilima]] as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]], he is also known as '''Marcelinho ''Para\u00edba''''', which refers to the state in which he was born, as a means to distinguish himself from [[Marcelinho|other players also called \"Marcelinho\"]]. He was arguably one of the best [[playmakers]] in the [[Bundesliga]] because of his extravagant skills that include his visionary passing, abundance of tricks, and his world class technique.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Campina Grande]], [[Para\u00edba]], Marcelinho Paraiba began his career in [[Campinense Clube|Campinense]], where he won two league titles there. Between 1994 and 1995, he played for [[Santos FC|Santos]]. Two years later, however, he made his breakthrough at [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]], where he won two Paulist\u00f5es before being sold to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\nHe only spent a year in France, and in 2001 he returned to Brazil to play for [[Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Gr\u00eamio]], where he began to experience the pinnacle of his career. At that time, Marcelinho Paraiba was called \"Marcelinho Para\u00facho\" by Gremistas, because of his passage in the team. He became champion and top scorer of the Campeonato Ga\u00facho, and champion of the [[Copa do Brasil]], where he scored a goal in the second game in the final against Corinthians, but did not play in the league that year because before the tournament, he signed a five-year contract with [[Hertha BSC]].\n\nMarcelinho played for Hertha from 2001 to 2006. He is ranked among the most important players in the association's history and there Marcelinho was known as a technically talented player, serving as a [[playmaker]] and leader while performing in both the midfield and forward area. In addition, he carried the responsibility of executing the [[Direct free kick|free kicks]], [[corner kick]]s, and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s of the club. The personal trademarks of this extravagant football player are his usually remarkable shoes and his often multicoloured hair. He was capped fives times for the [[Brazil national football team]], for which he scored once. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, he arbitrarily extended his off-season vacation by nine days, which led to some slight tension with the Hertha association management. After Marcelinho had expressed himself, in the following the days, contradictory statements as to whether he wanted to remain at Hertha or not, he ended his term with them, signing a three-year contract with [[Turkey|Turkish]] club [[Trabzonspor]] for approximately 2.5 million [[euro]]s.\n\nIn August 2008, Marcelinho Para\u00edba returned to Brazil to play for [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]].<ref name=\"flamengo\">{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro/2008/interna/0,,OI3074725-EI11421,00-Flamengo+acerta+com+meia+Marcelinho+Paraiba.html|title=Flamengo acerta com meia Marcelinho Para\u00edba|publisher=Terra Esportes|accessdate= 10 August 2008 |date= 10 August 2008|language=Portuguese}}</ref> On 6 March 2009, [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]] signed the forward on a free transfer until the end of the year, as Marcelinho terminated his contract with Flamengo.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.coritiba.com.br/site/index.php?pag=noticias&n_cod=7263&n_titulo=Coxa-e-Marcelinho-perto-de-acerto | title = Coxa e Marcelinho perto de acerto | language = Portuguese | date = 6 March 2009 | accessdate = 2 October 2010 | publisher = coritiba.com.br | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090310011633/http://www.coritiba.com.br/site/index.php?pag=noticias&n_cod=7263&n_titulo=Coxa-e-Marcelinho-perto-de-acerto | archivedate = 10 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> After the relegation of Coritiba, he re-signed for S\u00e3o Paulo on 18 December 2009.

2016|language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n| nationalteam-update = \n}}\n\n'''Marcelo dos Santos''' (born 17 May 1975), known as '''Marcelinho Para\u00edba''' or simply '''Marcelinho''', is a former Brazilian [[Association football|footballer]] who last played for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Desportiva Perilima|AD Perilima]] as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]], he is also known as '''Marcelinho ''Para\u00edba''''', which refers to the state in which he was born, as a means to distinguish himself from [[Marcelinho|other players also called \"Marcelinho\"]]. He was arguably one of the best [[playmakers]] in the [[Bundesliga]] because of his extravagant skills that include his visionary passing, abundance of tricks, and his world class technique.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Campina Grande]], [[Para\u00edba]], Marcelinho Paraiba began his career in [[Campinense Clube|Campinense]], where he won two league titles there. Between 1994 and 1995, he played for [[Santos FC|Santos]]. Two years later, however, he made his breakthrough at [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]], where he won two Paulist\u00f5es before being sold to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\nHe only spent a year in France, and in 2001 he returned to Brazil to play for [[Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Gr\u00eamio]], where he began to experience the pinnacle of his career. At that time, Marcelinho Paraiba was called \"Marcelinho Para\u00facho\" by Gremistas, because of his passage in the team. He became champion and top scorer of the Campeonato Ga\u00facho, and champion of the [[Copa do Brasil]], where he scored a goal in the second game in the final against Corinthians, but did not play in the league that year because before the tournament, he signed a five-year contract with [[Hertha BSC]].\n\nMarcelinho played for Hertha from 2001 to 2006. He is ranked among the most important players in the association's history and there Marcelinho was known as a technically talented player, serving as a [[playmaker]] and leader while performing in both the midfield and forward area. In addition, he carried the responsibility of executing the [[Direct free kick|free kicks]], [[corner kick]]s, and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s of the club. The personal trademarks of this extravagant football player are his usually remarkable shoes and his often multicoloured hair. He was capped fives times for the [[Brazil national football team]], for which he scored once. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, he arbitrarily extended his off-season vacation by nine days, which led to some slight tension with the Hertha association management. After Marcelinho had expressed himself, in the following the days, contradictory statements as to whether he wanted to remain at Hertha or not, he ended his term with them, signing a three-year contract with [[Turkey|Turkish]] club [[Trabzonspor]] for approximately 2.5 million [[euro]]s.\n\nIn August 2008, Marcelinho Para\u00edba returned to Brazil to play for [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]].<ref name=\"flamengo\">{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro/2008/interna/0,,OI3074725-EI11421,00-Flamengo+acerta+com+meia+Marcelinho+Paraiba.html|title=Flamengo acerta com meia Marcelinho Para\u00edba|publisher=Terra Esportes|accessdate= 10 August 2008 |date= 10 August 2008|language=Portuguese}}</ref> On 6 March 2009, [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]] signed the forward on a free transfer until the end of the year, as Marcelinho terminated his contract with Flamengo.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.coritiba.com.br/site/index.php?pag=noticias&n_cod=7263&n_titulo=Coxa-e-Marcelinho-perto-de-acerto | title = Coxa e Marcelinho perto de acerto | language = Portuguese | date = 6 March 2009 | accessdate = 2 October 2010 | publisher = coritiba.com.br | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090310011633/http://www.coritiba.com.br/site/index.php?pag=noticias&n_cod=7263&n_titulo=Coxa-e-Marcelinho-perto-de-acerto | archivedate = 10 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> After the relegation of Coritiba, he re-signed for S\u00e3o Paulo on 18 December 2009.

This is a castle divided into several parts, which belong to different families or different branches of a family; this usually occurs when multiple owners of one or more territories jointly build castle to house themselves. Only wealthy medieval European lords could afford to build castles or equivalent structures on their lands; many of them only owned one village, or even only part of a village. This was an insufficient base to afford castles. Such lords usually lived in \"knight's houses\", which were fairly simple houses, scarcely bigger than those of their [[leasehold estate|tenants]]. In some parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the German Nation, inheritance law required that the estate be divided among all successors. These successors, each of whose individual inheritance was too small to build a castle of his own, could build a castle together, where each owned one separate part for housing and all of them together shared the defensive fortification. In the case of Eltz, the family comprised three branches and the existing castle was enhanced with three separate complexes of buildings.\n\nThe main part of the castle consists of the family portions. At up to eight stories, these eight towers reach heights of between {{convert|30|and|40|m|ft}}. They are fortified with strong exterior walls; to the yard they present a partial framework.  About 100 members of the owners' families lived in the over 100 rooms of the castle. A village once existed below the castle, on its southside, which housed servants, craftsman, and their families supporting the castle.\n\n== History  ==\n[[File:Schloss Elz, c. 1860 IMG 4534a.jpg|thumb|Castle circa 1860]]\nPlatteltz, a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[keep]], is the oldest part of the castle, having begun in the 9th century as a simple manor with an earthen palisade. By 1157 the fortress was an important part of the empire under [[Frederick Barbarossa]], standing astride the trade route from the [[Moselle Valley]] and the [[Eifel]] region.<ref>de Fabianis, p. 135</ref> In the years 1331-1336, there occured the only serious military conflicts that the castle experienced. During the [[Eltz Feud]], the lords of Eltzer, together with other free imperial knights, opposed the territorial policy of the Archbishop and Elector Balduin von Trier. The Eltz Castle was put under siege and possible capture and was bombarded with catapults by the Archbishop of the Diocese of Trier. A small siege castle, [[Trutzeltz Castle]], was built on a rocky outcrop on the hillside above the castle, which can still be seen today as a few ruined walls outside of the northern side of the castle. The siege lasted for two years, but ended only when the free imperial knights had given up their imperial freedom. Balduin reinstated Johann again to the burgrave, but only as his subjects and no longer as a free knight. In 1472 the R\u00fcbenach house, built in the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] style, was completed. Remarkable are the R\u00fcbenach Lower Hall, a living room, and the R\u00fcbenach bedchamber with its opulently decorated walls.\n\nStarted in 1470 by Philipp zu Eltz, the 10-story Greater Rodendorf House takes its name from the family's land holding in [[Lorraine]]. The oldest part is the flag hall with its late Gothic vaulted ceiling, which was probably originally a chapel. Construction was completed around 1520. The (so-called) Little Rodendorf house was finished in 1540, also in Late Gothic style. It contains the vaulted \"banner-room\".\n\nThe Kempenich house replaced the original hall in 1615. Every room of this part of the castle could be heated; in contrast, other castles might only have one or two heated rooms.\n\nIn the Palatinate War of Succession from 1688 to 1689, most of the early Rhenish castles were destroyed. Since Hans Anton was a senior officer in the French army to Eltz \u00dcttingen, he was able to protect the castle Eltz from destruction.\n\nCount Hugo Philipp zu Eltz was thought to have fled during the French rule on the Rhine from 1794 to 1815. The French confiscated his possessions on the Rhine and nearby Trier which included Eltz castle, as well as the associated goods which were held at the French headquarters in Koblenz.\n\nIn 1797, when Count Hugo Philipp later turned out to had remained hidden in Mainz, he came back to the reclaim of his lands, goods and wealth. In 1815 he became the sole owner of the castle through the purchase of the R\u00fcbenacher house and the landed property of the barons of Eltz-R\u00fcbenach.\n\nIn the 19th century, Count Karl zu Eltz was committed to the restoration of his castle. In the period between 1845 to 1888, 184,000 marks (about 15 million euros in 2015) was invested into the extensive construction work, very carefully preserving the existing architecture.\n\nExtensive security and restoration work took place between the years 2009 to 2012. Among other things, the vault of flags hall was secured after it was at risk of partially collapsing  walls and the porch of the Kempenich section. In addition to these static repairs, almost all the slate roofs were replaced. Structural problems were remedied in the ceiling and wood damage was repaired. In the interior, heating and sanitary facilities, windows and fire alarm system were renewed, and also historic plaster was restored. The half-timbered facades and a spiral staircase were renovated at the costs of around \u20ac4.4 million euros. The measures were supported by a \u20ac2 million euros grant from an economic stimulus package provided by the German federal government. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the German Foundation for Monument Protection and the owners provided further funds.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Burg-Eltz-011-b.jpg|thumb|Castle Eltz, Aerial view]]\nThe R\u00fcbenach and Rodendorf families' homes in the castle are open to the public, while the Kempenich branch of the family uses the other third of the castle. The public is admitted seasonally, from April to October. Visitors can view the treasury, with gold, silver and porcelain artifacts and the armory of weapons and suits of armor.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFrom 1965 to 1992, an engraving of Eltz Castle was used on the German 500 Deutsche Mark note.<ref>[[:de:Bargeld der Deutschen Mark#Dritte Serie (.E2.80.9EBBk I.E2.80.9C)|Deutsche Mark \u2013 3.

A village once existed below the castle, on its southside, which housed servants, craftsman, and their families supporting the castle.\n\n== History  ==\n[[File:Schloss Elz, c. 1860 IMG 4534a.jpg|thumb|Castle circa 1860]]\nPlatteltz, a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[keep]], is the oldest part of the castle, having begun in the 9th century as a simple manor with an earthen palisade. By 1157 the fortress was an important part of the empire under [[Frederick Barbarossa]], standing astride the trade route from the [[Moselle Valley]] and the [[Eifel]] region.<ref>de Fabianis, p. 135</ref> In the years 1331-1336, there were the only serious of military conflicts that the castle experienced. During the [[Eltz Feud]], the lords of Eltzer, together with other free imperial knights, opposed the territorial policy of the Archbishop and Elector Balduin von Trier. The Eltz Castle was put under siege and possible capture and was bombarded with catapults by the Archbishop of the Diocese of Trier. A small siege castle, [[Trutzeltz Castle]], was built on a rocky outcrop on the hillside above the castle, which can still be seen today as a few ruined walls outside of the northern side of the castle. The siege lasted for two years, but ended only when the free imperial knights had given up their imperial freedom. Balduin reinstated Johann again to the burgrave, but only as his subjects and no longer as a free knight. In 1472 the R\u00fcbenach house, built in the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] style, was completed. Remarkable are the R\u00fcbenach Lower Hall, a living room, and the R\u00fcbenach bedchamber with its opulently decorated walls.\n\nStarted in 1470 by Philipp zu Eltz, the 10-story Greater Rodendorf House takes its name from the family's land holding in [[Lorraine]]. The oldest part is the flag hall with its late Gothic vaulted ceiling, which was probably originally a chapel. Construction was completed around 1520. The (so-called) Little Rodendorf house was finished in 1540, also in Late Gothic style. It contains the vaulted \"banner-room\".\n\nThe Kempenich house replaced the original hall in 1615. Every room of this part of the castle could be heated; in contrast, other castles might only have one or two heated rooms.\n\nIn the Palatinate War of Succession from 1688 to 1689, most of the early Rhenish castles were destroyed. Since Hans Anton was a senior officer in the French army to Eltz \u00dcttingen, he was able to protect the castle Eltz from destruction.\n\nCount Hugo Philipp zu Eltz was thought to have fled during the French rule on the Rhine from 1794 to 1815. The French confiscated his possessions on the Rhine and nearby Trier which included Eltz castle, as well as the associated goods which were held at the French headquarters in Koblenz.\n\nIn 1797, when Count Hugo Philipp later turned out to had remained hidden in Mainz, he came back to the reclaim of his lands, goods and wealth. In 1815 he became the sole owner of the castle through the purchase of the R\u00fcbenacher house and the landed property of the barons of Eltz-R\u00fcbenach.\n\nIn the 19th century, Count Karl zu Eltz was committed to the restoration of his castle. In the period between 1845 to 1888, 184,000 marks (about 15 million euros in 2015) was invested into the extensive construction work, very carefully preserving the existing architecture.\n\nExtensive security and restoration work took place between the years 2009 to 2012. Among other things, the vault of flags hall was secured after it was at risk of partially collapsing  walls and the porch of the Kempenich section. In addition to these static repairs, almost all the slate roofs were replaced. Structural problems were remedied in the ceiling and wood damage was repaired. In the interior, heating and sanitary facilities, windows and fire alarm system were renewed, and also historic plaster was restored. The half-timbered facades and a spiral staircase were renovated at the costs of around \u20ac4.4 million euros. The measures were supported by a \u20ac2 million euros grant from an economic stimulus package provided by the German federal government. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the German Foundation for Monument Protection and the owners provided further funds.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Burg-Eltz-011-b.jpg|thumb|Castle Eltz, Aerial view]]\nThe R\u00fcbenach and Rodendorf families' homes in the castle are open to the public, while the Kempenich branch of the family uses the other third of the castle. The public is admitted seasonally, from April to October. Visitors can view the treasury, with gold, silver and porcelain artifacts and the armory of weapons and suits of armor.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFrom 1965 to 1992, an engraving of Eltz Castle was used on the German 500 Deutsche Mark note.<ref>[[:de:Bargeld der Deutschen Mark#Dritte Serie (.E2.80.9EBBk I.E2.80.9C)|Deutsche Mark \u2013 3.

The treaty was never signed by the [[United States of America]]. The treaty was signed but never ratified by the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe proposed boundaries incorporated the Ottoman [[vilayets]] of [[Erzurum Vilayet|Erzurum]], [[Bitlis Vilayet|Bitlis]], and [[Van Vilayet|Van]], which once had Armenian populations of varying sizes. This region was extended to the north, up to the west side of [[Trabzon Vilayet|Trabzon]] to provide the [[First Republic of Armenia]] with an outlet to the [[Black Sea]] at the port of [[Trabzon]]. The proposed state of [[Republic of Pontus|Pontus]] was discussed at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, but the Greek government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] feared the precarious position of such a state and so it was included instead in the larger proposed state of Wilsonian Armenia.\n\nThe United States Senate rejected the mandate for Armenia in 1920. The outbreak of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] led to the Ottoman Empire not ratifying the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Later in that year, the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War]] broke out. Armenia was defeated and signed the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on November 2, 1920 renouncing its territorial integrity under the S\u00e8vres Treaty. The [[Treaty of Kars]] was negotiated between Soviet Russia and Turkey following the annexation of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] by the Soviet Army in December 2, 1920, and signed between the Soviet government in Armenia on October 23, 1921. The latter was never accepted, either by the overthrown Armenian government nor later by the Republic of Armenia. The government of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] separately negotiated a similar border between what it considered its territory of Armenia and [[Turkey]] in the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)]].\n\nThe final Turkish and Armenian borders were internationally agreed upon in the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 which replaced the generally unratified and unimplemented S\u00e8vres Treaty.\n\n==Negotiations==\n{{See also|Conference of London|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}\nDuring the [[Conference of London]], [[David Lloyd George]] encouraged [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] to accept a mandate for Anatolia, and particularly, with the support of the [[Armenian diaspora]], for the provinces claimed by the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|occupied Turkish Armenia]]. [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] sent the [[King-Crane Commission]] and General [[James Harbord]] to the region to study the claims made by the [[Armenian national movement]], and to determine if these claims were compatible with Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]]. The 12th point was:\n\n<blockquote>\"The [[Turkey|Turkish]] portion of the present [[Ottoman Empire]] should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the [[Dardanelles]] should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe King-Crane Commission tackled the issue of whether there should be an Armenian state, and whether or not this state should be created under a US mandate and concluded that there should be one. It has been noted that the arguments the Commission proposed to justify the creation of an Armenian state were similar to later arguments for the existence of Israel after [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Harbord recommended against dividing the territories inhabited by Armenians,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in order to prevent potential problems such as intercommunal wars. Harbord's report stated that \"the temptation to reprisals for past wrongs\" would make it extremely difficult to maintain peace in the region.\n\nThe King-Crane Commission noted that the Armenians had suffered a traumatic experience, that they couldn't trust the Ottoman Empire to respect their rights any more, and that the Armenians were \"a people.\" The Commission therefore recommended that the hard-won Armenian independence established during the [[Caucasus Campaign]] should be respected by the international community and insured by the Allies.\n\n==Armenian arguments==\nThe [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (ARF), using their position of leaders of the Armenian national movement, claimed that this region should not be part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] based on their assertion that Armenians had the capability to build a nation. [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenians]] had ''[[de facto]]'' control over a region surrounding the [[Van Province]] of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 3 years (1915-1918). The ARF stated that it was natural to annex this region to the newly established [[First Republic of Armenia]] (1918-1920), the first modern [[Armenia]]n [[republic]] created after the collapse of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]].\n\nAnother argument developed during this period was that the population was becoming increasingly more Armenian, and therefore Armenians were not a minority but a plurality; moving the displaced Armenians to this area should be considered as an option. In 1917, some 150,000 Armenians relocated to the provinces of Erzurum, Bitlis, [[Mu\u015f]], and Van.<ref name=hovannisian>Hovannisian Richard G. ''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Vol. II: Foreign Domination to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century''. New York: St Martin's Press, and London: Macmillan, 1997</ref> The Armenians had already begun building their houses and creating their farmlands. In 1917, the provincial governor [[Aram Manukian]] stated that a new autonomous state in the region should be founded, under Russia or the Ottoman Empire. [[Armen Garo]] (Karekin Pastermajian) and other spokesmen proposed to have Armenian soldiers in Europe transfer to the Caucasus front for the protection and stability of the new establishment. Armenian soldiers began to create a protective line between the Ottoman Army and Armenian front.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the aftermath of the King-Crane Commissions, events on the ground took their own course. President Wilson asked the United States Congress for the authority to establish a mandate for Armenia on May 24, 1920. The United States Senate rejected his request by a vote of 52 to 23 on June 1, 1920. In September 1920, the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War]] broke out. The First Republic of Armenia was defeated in November 1920 and signed the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] under which it renounced the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] along with various territorial claims to \"Western Armenia\". The government of Armenia was subsequently overthrown. The new Armenian government signed the [[Treaty of Kars]], which reaffirmed the previous Armenian concessions to Turkey and determined the modern-day borders between the two countries.\n\nIn late 1922, the various international parties negotiated the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] as a replacement for the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]].

Folliculogenesis describes the progression of a number of small ''[[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|primordial follicles]]'' into large ''[[Folliculogenesis#Late tertiary and preovulatory .28the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.29|preovulatory follicles]]'' that occurs in part during the [[menstrual cycle]].\n\nContrary to male [[spermatogenesis]], which can last indefinitely, folliculogenesis ends when the remaining follicles in the [[Ovary|ovaries]] are incapable of responding to the hormonal cues that previously recruited some follicles to mature. This depletion in follicle supply signals the beginning of [[menopause]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe primary role of the follicle is [[oocyte]] support. From birth, the [[ovaries]] of the human female contain a number of immature, [[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|primordial follicles]]. These follicles each contain a similarly immature [[primary oocyte]]. At [[puberty]] clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in death (apoptosis) or in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle).\n\nDuring follicular development, primordial follicles undergo a series of critical changes in character, both histologically and hormonally. First they change into primary follicles and later into secondary follicles. The follicles then transition to [[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|tertiary, or antral, follicles]]. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. [[Folliculogenesis#Late tertiary and preovulatory .28the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.29|The late tertiary or pre-ovulatory follicle]] ruptures and discharges the oocyte (that has become a [[secondary oocyte]]), ending folliculogenesis.\n\n[[File:Folliculogenesis chart.gif|frame|center|Diagram of folliculogenesis, starting from pre-antral (late secondary), courtesy NCBI]]\n\n==Phases of development==\nFolliculogenesis is continuous, meaning that at any time the ovary contains follicles in many stages of development. The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called [[ovulation]].\n\nThe growing follicle passes through the following distinct stages that are defined by certain structural characteristics:\n\nIn a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from primordial to preovulatory follicle, belongs to the stage of [[ootidogenesis]] of [[oogenesis]].\n\n{{Further|oogenesis}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''Stage''' || '''Description''' || '''Size''' \n |- \n | ''Primordial'' ||  [[Dormancy|Dormant]], small, only one layer of flat [[granulosa]] cells || Primordial follicles are about 0.03-0.05&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n |- \n | ''Primary'' ||  Mitotic cells, [[cuboidal]] granulosa cells || Almost 0.1&nbsp;mm in diameter\n |- \n | ''Secondary'' ||  Presence of [[Theca of follicle|theca cells]], multiple layers of granulosa cells || The follicle is now 0.2&nbsp;mm in diameter\n |- \n | ''Early tertiary'' ||  || The early tertiary follicle is arbitrarily divided into five classes.

During the late preovulatory stage, the oocyte continues meiosis and becomes a secondary oocyte, arrested in [[metaphase|metaphase II]].\n\n[[Image:Figure 28 02 04.JPG|thumb|right|600px|(a) The maturation of a follicle is shown in a clockwise direction proceeding from the primordial follicles. FSH stimulates the growth of a tertiary follicle, and LH stimulates the production of estrogen by granulosa and theca cells. Once the follicle is mature, it ruptures and releases the oocyte.

They are quiescent, showing little to no [[biological activity]]. Because primordial follicles can be dormant for up to 50 years in the human, the length of the ovarian cycle does not include this time.\n\nThe supply of follicles decreases slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty for the average case (populations at puberty range from 25,000 to 1.5 million).<ref name=\"WKmodel\"/> By virtue of the \"inefficient\" nature of folliculogenesis (discussed later), only 400 of these follicles will ever reach the preovulatory stage. At [[menopause]], only 1,000 follicles remain. It seems likely that early menopause occurs for women with low populations at birth, and late menopause occurs for women with high populations at birth, but there is as yet no clinical evidence for this.<ref name=\"WKmodel\"/>\n\nThe process by which primordial cells 'wake up' is known as initial recruitment. Research has shown that initial recruitment is mediated by the counterbalance of various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones and locally produced growth factors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortune J, Cushman R, Wahl C, Kito S | title = The primordial to primary follicle transition. | journal = Mol Cell Endocrinol | volume = 163 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 53\u201360 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10963874 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(99)00240-3}}</ref>\n\n===Primary===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Follicle histology2.gif|right]] -->\nDuring [[ovarian follicle activation]], the granulosa cells of the primordial follicles change from a flat to a cuboidal structure, marking the beginning of the ''primary follicle''. The oocyte genome is activated and genes become [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Rudimentary [[paracrine signalling]] pathways that are vital for communication between the follicle and oocyte are formed. Both the oocyte and the follicle grow dramatically, increasing to almost 0.1&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n\nPrimary follicles develop receptors to [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) at this time, but they are gonadotropin-independent until the antral stage. Research has shown, however, that the presence of FSH accelerates follicle growth ''in vitro''.\n\nA glycoprotein polymer capsule called the [[zona pellucida]] forms around the oocyte, separating it from the surrounding granulosa cells. The zona pellucida, which remains with the oocyte after ovulation, contains enzymes that catalyze with [[spermatozoon|sperm]] to allow penetration.\n\n===Secondary===\nStroma-like theca cells are recruited by oocyte-secreted signals. They surround the follicle's outermost layer, the [[basal lamina]], and undergo cytodifferentiation to become the [[theca externa]] and [[theca interna]]. An intricate network of capillary vessels forms between these two thecal layers and begins to circulate blood to and from the follicle.\n\nThe late-term secondary follicle is marked histologically and structurally by a fully grown oocyte surrounded by a zona pellucida, approximately nine layers of granulosa cells, a basal lamina, a theca interna, a capillary net, and a theca externa. The development of the antrum also starts taking place in secondary follicle stage\n\n===Antrum formation===\n{{Further|Antral follicle}}\nThe formation of a fluid-filled cavity adjacent to the oocyte called the [[Follicular antrum|antrum]] designates the follicle as an [[antral follicle]], in contrast to a so-called ''preantral follicle'' that still lacks an antrum. An antral follicle is also called a ''Graafian follicle''.\n\nDefinitions differ as to which stage this shift occurs in, with some designating follicles in the ''secondary'' stage as ''antral'',<ref name=Lauralee2010>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gOmpysGBC90C&pg=PT797 Page 769], section \"formation of the antrum\" in: {{Cite book  | last1 = Sherwood | first1 = Lauralee. | last2 =  | first2 =  | title = Human physiology : from cells to system | year = 2010 | publisher = Brooks/Cole | location = Australia; United States | isbn = 978-0-495-39184-5 | pages =  }}</ref> and others designating them as ''preantral''.<ref name=Hurk1997>Page 76 in: {{Cite journal | last1 = Vandenhurk | first1 = R. | last2 = Bevers | first2 = M. | last3 = Beckers | first3 = J. | title = In-vivo and in-vitro development of preantral follicles | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 47 | pages = 73\u201382 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-691X(96)00341-X}}</ref>\n\n===Early tertiary===\nIn the ''tertiary follicle'', the basic structure of the mature follicle has formed and no novel cells are detectable. Granulosa and theca cells continue to undergo mitotis concomitant with an increase in antrum volume. Tertiary follicles can attain a tremendous size that is hampered only by the availability of FSH, which it is now dependent on.\n\nUnder action of an oocyte-secreted morphogenic gradient, the granulosa cells of the tertiary follicle undergo differentiation into four distinct subtypes: ''corona radiata'', surrounding the zona pellucida; ''membrana'', interior to the basal lamina; ''periantral'', adjacent to the antrum and ''cumulus oophorous'', which connects the membrana and corona radiata granulosa cells together. Each type of cell behaves differently in response to FSH.\n\nTheca interna cells express receptors for luteinizing hormone ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]). LH induces the production of [[androgen]]s by the theca cells, most notably [[androstendione]], which are aromatized by granulosa cells to produce [[estrogens]], primarily [[estradiol]]. Consequently, estrogen levels begin to rise.\n\n===Late tertiary and preovulatory (the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle)===\nAt this point, the majority of the group of follicles that started growth have died. This process of follicle death is known as ''[[Ovarian follicle atresia|atresia]]'', and it is characterized by radical [[apoptosis]] of all constituent cells and the oocyte. Although it is not known what causes atresia, the presence of high concentrations of FSH has been shown to prevent it.\n\nA rise in pituitary FSH caused by the disintegration of the corpus luteum at the conclusion of a menstrual cycle precipitates the recruitment of five to seven class 5 follicles to participate in the next cycle. These follicles enter the end of the prior menstrual cycle and transition into the [[follicular phase]] of the next one. The selected follicles, called antral follicles, compete with each other for growth-inducing FSH.\n\nThe pattern of this emergence of a cohort of five to seven antral follicles is debated. There are theories of continuous recruitment of antral follicles, theories of a single recruitment episode at the end of the luteal phase, and more recently there has been evidence for a recruitment model marked by 2 - 3 waves of follicle recruitment and development during the menstrual cycle (only one of which is actually an ovulatory wave).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51784552_Ovarian_antral_folliculogenesis_during_the_human_menstrual_cycle_A_review|title=(PDF) Ovarian antral folliculogenesis during the human menstrual cycle: A review|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the rise of FSH, the antral follicles begin to secrete estrogen and [[inhibin]], which have a negative feedback effect on FSH.<ref>de Ziegler D (2007), \"Roles of FSH and LH during the follicular phase: insight into the natural cycle IVF\", RBM Online volume 15 No. 5, page 508</ref> Follicles that have fewer [[FSH-receptor]]s will not be able to develop further; they will show retardation of their growth rate and become atretic.

This remaining follicle, called the ''dominant follicle'', will grow quickly and dramatically\u2014up to 20&nbsp;mm in diameter\u2014to become the ''preovulatory follicle''.\n\n''Note: Many sources misrepresent the pace of follicle growth, some even suggesting that it takes only fourteen days for a primordial follicle to become preovulatory. Actually, the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle means the time between selection of a tertiary follicle and its subsequent growth into a preovulatory follicle. The actual time for development of a follicle varies. ''\n\nThe growth of the dominant follicle during the [[follicular phase]] is about 1.5&nbsp;mm per day (\u00b10.1&nbsp;mm), both in natural cycles and for any dominant follicle developing while taking [[combined oral contraceptive pill]].<ref name=\"BaerwaldWalker2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Baerwald|first1=Angela R.|last2=Walker|first2=Randy A.|last3=Pierson|first3=Roger A.|title=Growth rates of ovarian follicles during natural menstrual cycles, oral contraception cycles, and ovarian stimulation cycles|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=91|issue=2|year=2009|pages=440\u2013449|issn=0015-0282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.054}}</ref> Performing [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] leads to a greater recruitment of follicles, growing at about 1.6&nbsp;mm per day.<ref name=\"BaerwaldWalker2009\"/>\n\n==Ovulation and the corpus luteum==\nBy the end of the follicular (or proliferative) phase of the thirteenth day of the menstrual cycle, the [[cumulus oophorus]] layer of the preovulatory follicle will develop an opening, or ''stigma'', and excrete the oocyte with a complement of cumulus cells in a process called [[ovulation]]. In natural cycles, ovulation may occur in follicles that are at least 14&nbsp;mm.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=m4RlDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA4-PA34 Page 34] in: {{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reproduction|author=Michael K. Skinner|edition=2|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128151457}}</ref>\n\nThe oocyte is technically still a secondary oocyte, suspended in the metaphase II of meiosis. It will develop into an ootid, and rapidly thereafter into an ovum (via completion of meiosis II) only upon fertilization.  The oocyte will now travel down one of the [[fallopian tubes]] to eventually be discharged through menstruation in the case that it is unfertilized or if it is not successfully implanted in the [[uterus]] (if previously [[fertilization|fertilized]]).\n\nThe ruptured follicle will undergo a dramatic transformation into the [[corpus luteum]], a steroidiogenic cluster of cells that maintains the [[endometrium]] of the uterus by the secretion of large amounts of [[progesterone]] and minor amounts of [[estrogen]].\n\nThese two steps, while not part of folliculogenesis, are included for completeness. They are discussed in their entirety by their respective articles, and placed into perspective by the [[menstrual cycle]] article. It is recommended that these three topics be reviewed.\n\n==Hormone function==\nAs with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the [[endocrine system]]. Five hormones participate in an intricate process of positive and negative feedback to regulate folliculogenesis. They are:\n* [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) secreted by the [[hypothalamus]]\n* two [[gonadotropins]]:\n** [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH)\n** [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH)\n* [[estrogen]]\n* [[progesterone]]\n\nGnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH). When theca cells form in the tertiary follicle the amount of estrogen increases sharply (theca-derived androgen is aromatized into estrogen by the granulosa cells).\n\nAt low concentration, estrogen inhibits gonadotropins, but high concentration of estrogen stimulates them. In addition, as more estrogen is secreted, more LH receptors are made by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition.\n\nThe endocrine system coincides with the menstrual cycle and goes through thirteen cycles (and thus thirteen LH spikes) during the course of normal folliculogenesis. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes.\n\n== Number of follicles ==\n[[File:Non-Growing Follicles.png|thumb|right|500px|\"'''Percentage of ovarian reserve related to increasing age.'''

These follicles each contain a similarly immature [[primary oocyte]]. At [[puberty]] clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in death (apoptosis) or in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle).\n\nDuring follicular development, primordial follicles undergo a series of critical changes in character, both histologically and hormonally. First they change into primary follicles and later into secondary follicles. The follicles then transition to [[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|tertiary, or antral, follicles]]. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. [[Folliculogenesis#Late tertiary and preovulatory .28the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.29|The late tertiary or pre-ovulatory follicle]] ruptures and discharges the oocyte (that has become a [[secondary oocyte]]), ending folliculogenesis.\n\n[[File:Folliculogenesis chart.gif|frame|center|Diagram of folliculogenesis, starting from pre-antral (late secondary), courtesy NCBI]]\n\n==Phases of development==\nFolliculogenesis is continuous, meaning that at any time the ovary contains follicles in many stages of development. The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called [[ovulation]].\n\nThe growing follicle passes through the following distinct stages that are defined by certain structural characteristics:\n\nIn a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from primordial to preovulatory follicle, belongs to the stage of [[ootidogenesis]] of [[oogenesis]].\n\n{{Further|oogenesis}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''Stage''' || '''Description''' || '''Size''' \n |- \n | ''Primordial'' ||  [[Dormancy|Dormant]], small, only one layer of flat [[granulosa]] cells || Primordial follicles are about 0.03-0.05&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n |- \n | ''Primary'' ||  Mitotic cells, [[cuboidal]] granulosa cells || Almost 0.1&nbsp;mm in diameter\n |- \n | ''Secondary'' ||  Presence of [[Theca of follicle|theca cells]], multiple layers of granulosa cells || The follicle is now 0.2&nbsp;mm in diameter\n |- \n | ''Early tertiary'' ||  || The early tertiary follicle is arbitrarily divided into five classes.

Definitions differ in where this shift occurs in the staging given above, with some stating that it occurs when entering the ''secondary'' stage,<ref name=Lauralee2010/> and others stating that it occurs when entering the ''tertiary'' stage.<ref name=Hurk1997/>\n\nUntil the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of [[meiosis|meiosis I]]. During the late preovulatory stage, the oocyte continues meiosis and becomes a secondary oocyte, arrested in [[metaphase|metaphase II]].\n\n[[Image:Figure 28 02 04.JPG|thumb|right|600px|(a) The maturation of a follicle is shown in a clockwise direction proceeding from the primordial follicles. FSH stimulates the growth of a tertiary follicle, and LH stimulates the production of estrogen by granulosa and theca cells. Once the follicle is mature, it ruptures and releases the oocyte. Cells remaining in the follicle then develop into the corpus luteum.

They are quiescent, showing little to no [[biological activity]]. Because primordial follicles can be dormant for up to 50 years in the human, the length of the ovarian cycle does not include this time.\n\nThe supply of follicles decreases slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty for the average case (populations at puberty range from 25,000 to 1.5 million).<ref name=\"WKmodel\"/> By virtue of the \"inefficient\" nature of folliculogenesis (discussed later), only 400 of these follicles will ever reach the preovulatory stage. At [[menopause]], only 1,000 follicles remain. It seems likely that early menopause occurs for women with low populations at birth, and late menopause occurs for women with high populations at birth, but there is as yet no clinical evidence for this.<ref name=\"WKmodel\"/>\n\nThe process by which primordial cells 'wake up' is known as initial recruitment. Research has shown that initial recruitment is mediated by the counterbalance of various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones and locally produced growth factors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortune J, Cushman R, Wahl C, Kito S | title = The primordial to primary follicle transition. | journal = Mol Cell Endocrinol | volume = 163 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 53\u201360 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10963874 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(99)00240-3}}</ref>\n\n===Primary===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Follicle histology2.gif|right]] -->\nDuring [[ovarian follicle activation]], the granulosa cells of the primordial follicles change from a flat to a cuboidal structure, marking the beginning of the ''primary follicle''. The oocyte genome is activated and genes become [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Rudimentary [[paracrine signalling]] pathways that are vital for communication between the follicle and oocyte are formed. Both the oocyte and the follicle grow dramatically, increasing to almost 0.1&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n\nPrimary follicles develop receptors to [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) at this time, but they are gonadotropin-independent until the antral stage. Research has shown, however, that the presence of FSH accelerates follicle growth ''in vitro''.\n\nA glycoprotein polymer capsule called the [[zona pellucida]] forms around the oocyte, separating it from the surrounding granulosa cells. The zona pellucida, which remains with the oocyte after ovulation, contains enzymes that catalyze with [[spermatozoon|sperm]] to allow penetration.\n\n===Secondary===\nStroma-like theca cells are recruited by oocyte-secreted signals. They surround the follicle's outermost layer, the [[basal lamina]], and undergo cytodifferentiation to become the [[theca externa]] and [[theca interna]]. An intricate network of capillary vessels forms between these two thecal layers and begins to circulate blood to and from the follicle.\n\nThe late-term secondary follicle is marked histologically and structurally by a fully grown oocyte surrounded by a zona pellucida, approximately nine layers of granulosa cells, a basal lamina, a theca interna, a capillary net, and a theca externa. The development of the antrum also starts taking place in secondary follicle stage\n\n===Antrum formation===\n{{Further|Antral follicle}}\nThe formation of a fluid-filled cavity adjacent to the oocyte called the [[Follicular antrum|antrum]] designates the follicle as an [[antral follicle]], in contrast to a so-called ''preantral follicle'' that still lacks an antrum. An antral follicle is also called a ''Graafian follicle''.\n\nDefinitions differ as to which stage this shift occurs in, with some designating follicles in the ''secondary'' stage as ''antral'',<ref name=Lauralee2010>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gOmpysGBC90C&pg=PT797 Page 769], section \"formation of the antrum\" in: {{Cite book  | last1 = Sherwood | first1 = Lauralee. | last2 =  | first2 =  | title = Human physiology : from cells to system | year = 2010 | publisher = Brooks/Cole | location = Australia; United States | isbn = 978-0-495-39184-5 | pages =  }}</ref> and others designating them as ''preantral''.<ref name=Hurk1997>Page 76 in: {{Cite journal | last1 = Vandenhurk | first1 = R. | last2 = Bevers | first2 = M. | last3 = Beckers | first3 = J. | title = In-vivo and in-vitro development of preantral follicles | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 47 | pages = 73\u201382 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-691X(96)00341-X}}</ref>\n\n===Early tertiary===\nIn the ''tertiary follicle'', the basic structure of the mature follicle has formed and no novel cells are detectable. Granulosa and theca cells continue to undergo mitotis concomitant with an increase in antrum volume. Tertiary follicles can attain a tremendous size that is hampered only by the availability of FSH, which it is now dependent on.\n\nUnder action of an oocyte-secreted morphogenic gradient, the granulosa cells of the tertiary follicle undergo differentiation into four distinct subtypes: ''corona radiata'', surrounding the zona pellucida; ''membrana'', interior to the basal lamina; ''periantral'', adjacent to the antrum and ''cumulus oophorous'', which connects the membrana and corona radiata granulosa cells together. Each type of cell behaves differently in response to FSH.\n\nTheca interna cells express receptors for luteinizing hormone ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]). LH induces the production of [[androgen]]s by the theca cells, most notably [[androstendione]], which are aromatized by granulosa cells to produce [[estrogens]], primarily [[estradiol]]. Consequently, estrogen levels begin to rise.\n\n===Late tertiary and preovulatory (the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle)===\nAt this point, the majority of the group of follicles that started growth have died. This process of follicle death is known as ''[[Ovarian follicle atresia|atresia]]'', and it is characterized by radical [[apoptosis]] of all constituent cells and the oocyte. Although it is not known what causes atresia, the presence of high concentrations of FSH has been shown to prevent it.\n\nA rise in pituitary FSH caused by the disintegration of the corpus luteum at the conclusion of a menstrual cycle precipitates the recruitment of five to seven class 5 follicles to participate in the next cycle. These follicles enter the end of the prior menstrual cycle and transition into the [[follicular phase]] of the next one. The selected follicles, called antral follicles, compete with each other for growth-inducing FSH. \n\nThe pattern of this emergence of a cohort of five to seven antral follicles is debated. There are theories of continuous recruitment of antral follicles, theories of a single recruitment episode at the end of the luteal phase, and more recently there has been evidence for a recruitment model marked by 2 - 3 waves of follicle recruitment and development during the menstrual cycle (only one of which is actually an ovulatory wave). <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51784552_Ovarian_antral_folliculogenesis_during_the_human_menstrual_cycle_A_review|title=(PDF) Ovarian antral folliculogenesis during the human menstrual cycle: A review|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the rise of FSH, the antral follicles begin to secrete estrogen and [[inhibin]], which have a negative feedback effect on FSH.<ref>de Ziegler D (2007), \"Roles of FSH and LH during the follicular phase: insight into the natural cycle IVF\", RBM Online volume 15 No. 5, page 508</ref> Follicles that have fewer [[FSH-receptor]]s will not be able to develop further; they will show retardation of their growth rate and become atretic. Eventually, only one follicle will be viable. This remaining follicle, called the ''dominant follicle'', will grow quickly and dramatically\u2014up to 20&nbsp;mm in diameter\u2014to become the ''preovulatory follicle''.\n\n''Note: Many sources misrepresent the pace of follicle growth, some even suggesting that it takes only fourteen days for a primordial follicle to become preovulatory. Actually, the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle means the time between selection of a tertiary follicle and its subsequent growth into a preovulatory follicle. The actual time for development of a follicle varies. ''\n\nThe growth of the dominant follicle during the [[follicular phase]] is about 1.5 mm per day (\u00b10.1 mm), both in natural cycles and for any dominant follicle developing while taking [[combined oral contraceptive pill]].<ref name=\"BaerwaldWalker2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Baerwald|first1=Angela R.|last2=Walker|first2=Randy A.|last3=Pierson|first3=Roger A.|title=Growth rates of ovarian follicles during natural menstrual cycles, oral contraception cycles, and ovarian stimulation cycles|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=91|issue=2|year=2009|pages=440\u2013449|issn=00150282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.054}}</ref> Performing [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] leads to a greater recruitment of follicles, growing at about 1.6 mm per day.<ref name=\"BaerwaldWalker2009\"/>\n\n==Ovulation and the corpus luteum==\nBy the end of the follicular (or proliferative) phase of the thirteenth day of the menstrual cycle, the [[cumulus oophorus]] layer of the preovulatory follicle will develop an opening, or ''stigma'', and excrete the oocyte with a complement of cumulus cells in a process called [[ovulation]]. In natural cycles, ovulation may occur in follicles that are at least 14 mm.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=m4RlDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA4-PA34 Page 34] in: {{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reproduction|author=Michael K. Skinner|edition=2|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128151457}}</ref>\n\nThe oocyte is technically still a secondary oocyte, suspended in the metaphase II of meiosis. It will develop into an ootid, and rapidly thereafter into an ovum (via completion of meiosis II) only upon fertilization.  The oocyte will now travel down one of the [[fallopian tubes]] to eventually be discharged through menstruation in the case that it is unfertilized or if it is not successfully implanted in the [[uterus]] (if previously [[fertilization|fertilized]]).\n\nThe ruptured follicle will undergo a dramatic transformation into the [[corpus luteum]], a steroidiogenic cluster of cells that maintains the [[endometrium]] of the uterus by the secretion of large amounts of [[progesterone]] and minor amounts of [[estrogen]].\n\nThese two steps, while not part of folliculogenesis, are included for completeness. They are discussed in their entirety by their respective articles, and placed into perspective by the [[menstrual cycle]] article. It is recommended that these three topics be reviewed.\n\n==Hormone function==\nAs with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the [[endocrine system]]. Five hormones participate in an intricate process of positive and negative feedback to regulate folliculogenesis. They are:\n* [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) secreted by the [[hypothalamus]]\n* two [[gonadotropins]]:\n** [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH)\n** [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH)\n* [[estrogen]]\n* [[progesterone]]\n\nGnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH). When theca cells form in the tertiary follicle the amount of estrogen increases sharply (theca-derived androgen is aromatized into estrogen by the granulosa cells).\n\nAt low concentration, estrogen inhibits gonadotropins, but high concentration of estrogen stimulates them. In addition, as more estrogen is secreted, more LH receptors are made by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition.\n\nThe endocrine system coincides with the menstrual cycle and goes through thirteen cycles (and thus thirteen LH spikes) during the course of normal folliculogenesis. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes.\n\n== Number of follicles ==\n[[File:Non-Growing Follicles.png|thumb|right|500px|\"'''Percentage of ovarian reserve related to increasing age.'''
