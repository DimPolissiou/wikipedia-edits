A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating.

Muhammad gave his permission that the men could hit their wives in cases of rebelliousness. The women then turned to the wives of the Prophet and complained about their husbands.

Brown]] says:\n<blockquote>The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.<ref>Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to ''Honour, Violence, Women and Islam'', and Islamic scholar Dr. Muhammad Sharif Chaudhry, [[Muhammad]] condemns violence against women, by saying: \"How loathsome (Ajeeb) it is that one of you should hit his wife as a slave is hit, and then sleep with her at the end of the day.\"<ref name = \"bukhari\">{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/138  |title=Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah) |author=Muhammad al-Bukhari|work=Sunnah.com|accessdate=9 March 2020|author-link=Muhammad al-Bukhari }}</ref><ref name=Idriss/><ref>Chaudhry, Muhammad Sharif.

They permitted the husband a lot of leeway in the severity of the beating. The Hanafi scholars assert that the husband is allowed to hit his wife even if that causes wounds or broken bones. Their only condition is that the beating must not kill her.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=103\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Hanafi scholars emphasised the procedure of admonishing, abandoning and hitting the wife. Al-Kasani added that the admonishment contains two steps: gentle admonishment and then harsh admonishment. However, jurists faced a paradox with the abandonment step, since it would cause injustice to the husband as he would not be able to enjoy his sexual rights over the wife if he abandoned her. Al-Kasani ruled that a husband can abandon his wife verbally and not necessarily sexually. This means that the husband can simply force his wife to have sex. Al-Kasani pointed out that marital rape is allowed in Islamic law.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

Ibn Nujaym states that as long as a wife is in her husband's house she is entitled to maintenance since he can force her to have sex with him. Al-Nasafi adds that if a wife dies during sex, the husband is not liable. Al-Nasafi also understood this to be the position of Imam Abu Hanifah.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

They permitted the husband a lot of leeway in the severity of the beating. The Hanafi scholars assert that the husband is allowed to hit his wife even if that causes wounds or broken bones. Their only condition is that the beating must not kill her.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

Al-Kasani added that the admonishment contains two steps: gentle admonishment and then harsh admonishment. However, jurists faced a paradox with the abandonment step, since it would cause injustice to the husband as he would not be able to enjoy his sexual rights over the wife if he abandoned her. Al-Kasani ruled that a husband can abandon his wife verbally and not necessarily sexually. This means that the husband can simply force his wife to have sex. Al-Kasani pointed out that marital rape is allowed in Islamic law.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

Ibn Nujaym states that as long as a wife is in her husband's house she is entitled to maintenance since he can force her to have sex with him. Al-Nasafi adds that if a wife dies during sex, the husband is not liable. Al-Nasafi also understood this to be the position of Imam Abu Hanifah.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

{"title_page": "Forensic firearm examination", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{ForensicScience|criminal|image=.38 Special mushrooming side view.jpg}}\n\n'''Forensic firearm examination''' is the [[forensic]] process of examining the characteristics of [[firearm]]s as well as any [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s or [[bullet]]s left behind at a [[crime scene]]. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) is the most common reagent used for this.  Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges. Fingerprints are key pieces of evidence. If crime scene investigators find prints at a scene, they will be dusted, photographed, collected, and analyzed both by hand (using comparison microscopes) as well as compared to databases for potential references.\n\nBy examining unique striations, scratches left behind on the bullet and weapon, individual fired rounds can be, but not always are, linked back to a specific weapon. These striations are due to the rifling inside the barrel of handguns. Rifling spins the bullet when it is shot out of the barrel to improve accuracy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heard |first=Brian |year=2013 |title=Forensic Ballistics in Court: Interpretation and Presentation of Firearms Evidence |location= |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781118505014 |pages=33\u201342}}</ref> Although striations are individualized evidence and will not match any other bullet or weapon, microscopic striations in the barrel of the weapon will change about every three to five shots. This is important because if attorneys wish to present ballistics evidence in court, it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one specific bullet would match one specific weapon. Forensic ballistics examiners may not fire more than five shots at most from a weapon found at a scene for this exact reason.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heard |first=Brian |year=2013 |title=Forensic Ballistics in Court: Interpretation and Presentation of Firearms Evidence |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-50501-4 |location= |pages=41}}</ref> Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a [[comparison microscope]] as well as newer 3-D imaging technology. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings can be compared to other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as [[expert witness]]es.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of [[rifling]] around the turn of the 16th century.<ref name=\"firearmsid\" />  By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] of the weapon the bullet's accuracy greatly increases.  At the same time, the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel.  Prior to mass production of firearms, each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by [[gunsmith]]s making them unique.<ref name=\"ABA\" />  The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the [[Bow Street Runners]] in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect's home confirming that he made the bullet.  Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted.<ref name=\"firearmsid\" />  As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools, the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company.  However, experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process. These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear, each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company.<ref name=\"ABA\" />  Also, each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks, allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet.<ref name=\"adaa\" /> Hi i'm alley.\n\nOne of the first uses of this knowledge was in 1915 to exonerate Charles Stielow of the murder of his neighbors.  Stielow was sentenced to death and appealed to [[Charles S. Whitman]], the Governor of New York, who was not convinced by the evidence used to convict Stielow.  Whitman halted the execution until an inquiry could be conducted and after further examination it was shown that Stielow's firearm could not have fired the bullets recovered from the victims.<ref name=\"Borchard\" /> The invention of the [[comparison microscope]] by [[Calvin Goddard (ballistics)|Calvin Goddard]] and [[Phillip O. Gravelle]] in 1925 modernized the forensic examination of firearms.<ref name=\"Cominvent\" /> Simultaneous comparison of two different objects at the same time allowed to closely examine striations for matches and therefore make a more definitive statement as to whether or not they matched.\n\nOne of the first true tests of this new technology was in the aftermath of the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] in 1929. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition Era]], competing gang members were fighting over [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] operations within the city of [[Chicago]]. Members of the [[Chicago Outfit]] and the [[Egan's Rats]] led by [[Al Capone]] attempted to remove all competition from Chicago by eliminating the [[North Side Gang]] leader [[Bugs Moran]].<ref name=\"Massacre2\" /><ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The massacre missed Moran, who was not present, but killed seven members of the North Side Gang. The murderers attempted to cover up their crime by posing as police officers, even dressing in police uniforms.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> Witnesses saw two \"officers\" leaving the scene, which implicated the Chicago police department as the perpetrators of the massacre. High levels of police corruption during that time period made it seem likely that the police department committed the killings.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The investigation stalled until December 1929 when [[Fred Burke]], a member of the Egan's Rats, shot and killed a police officer in [[St. Joseph, Michigan]]. Officers searching for Burke were led to a home in nearby [[Stevensville, Michigan|Stevensville]]. While Burke was not there, inside officers found an arsenal of weapons including two [[Thompson submachine gun]]s.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The Chicago police department was contacted and the weapons were brought back to Chicago for testing. Goddard was asked to compare the weapons to collected evidence found at the massacre using his new \"ballistic-forensics\" technique. After test firing the guns, Goddard proved that the weapons were those used to kill the members of the North Side Gang, absolving the Chicago police department of all involvement.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The successful use of Goddard's technique resulted in the solidification of his place as the father of forensic firearm examination.<ref name=\"father\" />\n\n== Examination of the firearm ==\n\n[[File:Pistol serial number.png|thumb|left|Multiple serial numbers provide redundancy and make it difficult to fully remove the numbers from a weapon.]]\nAny firearm collected during the course of an investigation could yield viable evidence if examined. For forensic firearm examination specific evidence that can be recovered include weapon [[serial number]]s and potentially [[fingerprint]]s left on the weapon's surface.\n\n===Fingerprint recovery===\n\nFingerprint recovery from the surface of firearms is done with [[cyanoacrylate]] (more commonly known as superglue) fuming.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /> Firearms are placed in a specially designed [[fume hood]] designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white.<ref name=\"BCAprint\" /> The resulting white print can be enhanced with [[fingerprint powder]] to increase the contrast of the white print against the weapon's finish.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /> While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /><ref name=\"print diff\" />  If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever handled it. However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as [[allele]] drop-out and drop-in.<ref name=\"GunDNA\" />\n\n===Serial number recovery===\n\nSerial numbers became commonplace after the United States passed the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].  This law mandated that all guns manufactured in or imported into the country have a serial number.<ref name=\"GunAct\" />{{rp|1223}} Prior to 1968, many firearms either did not have a serial number or the serial numbers were not unique and were reused by a manufacturer on multiple firearms.<ref name=\"ATF\" />  If a recovered weapon has had the serial numbers altered or destroyed, examiners can attempt to recover the original numbers.  The two main methods for the restoration of serial numbers are [[magnetic particle inspection]] and chemical restoration.<ref name=\"restore\" />  It is recommended that magnetic particle inspection be performed first due to the [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] nature of the method.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" />  If magnetic particle inspection fails, chemical restoration is the next step in the forensic analysis.\n\nIf the serial number is successfully restored it can be used to help investigators track the weapon's history, as well as potentially determine who owns the weapon.  Firearm databases such as the [[National Crime Information Center]] of the United States and [[INTERPOL|INTERPOL's]] Firearm Reference Table can be used by investigators to track weapons that have been lost, stolen, or used previously in other crimes.<ref name=IFRT /><ref name=\"NCIC\" />\n\n====Magnetic particle inspection====\n\nOriginally developed as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in [[Ferromagnetism|magnetic]] materials, magnetic particle inspection can be used on firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" /> When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a [[magnetic field]]. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" /> When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area.<ref name=\"MPIUV\" /> If [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] particles are added to the ferrous solution, [[ultraviolet light]] can be used to make it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.<ref name=\"MPIUV\" />\n\n====Chemical restoration====\n\nChemical restoration is a type of [[chemical milling]]. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until variations in the metal corresponding to the serial number are visible. This is possible because [[stamping (metalworking)|stamping]] the numbers distorts the [[grain boundary]] structure underneath the surface of the metal. However, chemical restoration is limited to that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated.<ref name=\"acids\" /> The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an [[acid]],<ref name=\"acids\" /> that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from [[Fry's Reagent]] for a magnetic metal,<ref name=\"restore\" /> which is a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid]], [[cupric chloride]], and [[distilled water]],<ref name=\"Fry\" /> to an acidic [[ferric chloride]] solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.<ref name=\"restore\" />\n\n== Examination of cartridges ==\n[[File:Fired cartridge comparison.png|thumb|right|Two test-fired cartridges under magnification. Matching striations can be seen.]]\nSpent cartridges found at a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the various parts of the weapon including the [[firing pin]] and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|151}} The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a [[comparison microscope]]. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|152}}\n[[File:8digit_NanoTest.jpg|thumb|left|Example of microstamping. Insert shows a close up of the serial number imprinted into the cartridge.]]\nCartridges are also routinely examined for fingerprints as the act of loading the ammunition into the magazine, or chamber, leaves recoverable impressions.  These fingerprints can survive the firing processes and, while a rare occurrence, fingerprints have been obtained from cartridges recovered from the scene.<ref name=\"Cartprints\" /> Cartridges are subjected to cyanoacrylate fuming and examined for any usable prints. Usable prints are photographed and can be uploaded to fingerprint databases such as IAFIS for comparison with known exemplars. Cartridges can also be swabbed for trace DNA left by the individual who loaded the magazine. The extremely low levels of recoverable DNA present the same issues as swabbing a firearm for DNA.<ref name=\"GunDNA\" />\n\nAdvancements in microscopic stamping have led to a push for the inclusion of firing pin [[microstamping]].<ref name=\"Stampreport\" />{{rp|16}} The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm.<ref name=\"Stampreport\" />{{rp|17}} The practice is not in use {{as of|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|lc=y}}, although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms.<ref name=\"Calstamplaw\" /> The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.<ref name=\"Nomicro\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n== Examination of bullets ==\n[[File:Marlin 35 rem 2.jpg|thumb|left|Rifling pattern for a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle showing a clockwise (right-handed) twist.]]\n\n===Class characteristics===\n\nPreliminary examination of the bullet can exclude a large number of weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures.<ref name=\"BulletBook\" />{{rp|32}} The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the [[caliber]] of the bullet, and the rifling twist.<ref name=\"ncdoj\" /> All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet.<ref name=\"ncdoj\" /> The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the [[rifling]] is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] which uses left-handed twists.<ref name=\"BulletBook\" />{{rp|29}} Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.\n\n===Individual characteristics===\nIn order to compare individual striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars are created by firing the weapon into a water tank.<ref name=\"FBIfirearms\" /> The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles.<ref name=\"Tankbook\" /> To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a [[shooting range|controlled range]] with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.<ref name=\"FBIfirearms\" />\n\nOnce a known exemplar is produced, the evidence sample can be compared to the known by examining both at the same time with a comparison microscope.  Striations that line up are examined more closely, looking for multiple consecutive matches. There is no set number of consecutive matches that equates to a match declaration, and examiners are trained to use the phrase \"sufficient agreement\" when testifying. The degree to which an examiner can make that determination is based on their training and expertise.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|153}}  All findings by examiners are subject to questioning by both sides, prosecution and defense, during testimony in court.\n\n==Striation databasing==\n\nBullets and casings found at a scene require a known example to compare to in order to match them to a weapon. Without a weapon, the striation pattern can be uploaded to a database such as the [[National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network]] (NIBIN) maintained by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] or the United Kingdom's [[National Ballistics Intelligence Service]] (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together.<ref name=\"NIBINNews\" /><ref name=\"BBCGun\" /> Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.<ref name=\"ATFHelp\" />\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nFirearm examiners have attempted to determine the shooter's position by the location of spent bullet casings. The use of ejection pattern studies were originally part of incident reconstruction and methods for determining shooter location continue to be explained in major crime scene examination books.<ref name=\"EjectionBook\" />  However, the validity of ejection pattern analysis has been brought into question by multiple studies that look at the [[reproducibility]] and end determination of shooter position by qualified examiners. Studies have shown that over 25% of spent casings land somewhere other than to the right and rear of the shooter.<ref name=\"ISJShooter\" /> This is the most commonly accepted location for where spent cartridge casings should fall, and the large percentage of casings that end up somewhere else raises concerns for the validity of the examination technique. Investigators should only present a location gained from an ejection pattern study as a tentative estimate when using the information in a courtroom setting.<ref name=\"ISJShooter\" />\n\nPrior to September 2005, [[comparative bullet-lead analysis]] was performed on bullets found at a scene that were too destroyed for striation comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet and compare it to seized bullets possessed by a suspect.<ref name=\"CBLA\" /> Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, there are not enough differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession.<ref name=\"Metallurgical\" /> An additional report in 2004 from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially \"misleading under the federal rules of evidence\".<ref name=\"CBLA\" /> In 2005, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] indicated that they would no longer be performing this type of analysis.<ref name=\"CBLA FBI\" />\n\nFurther criticism came from the 2009 NAS report on the current state of various forensic fields in the United States. The report's section on firearm examination focused on the lack of defined requirements that are necessary in order to determine \"matches\" between known and unknown striations.  The NAS stated that, \"sufficient studies have not been done to understand the reliability and repeatability of the methods.\"<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|154}} Without defined procedures on what is and what isn't considered \"sufficient agreement\" the report states that forensic firearm examination contains fundamental problems that need to be addressed by the forensic community through a set of repeatable scientific studies that outline standard operating procedures that should be adopted by all firearm examiners.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|155}} Another report issued in 2016 by the [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] confirmed the NAS's findings, finding only one appropriately designed study that examined the rate of false positives and reliability amongst firearm examiners.<ref name=\"PCASTReport\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Ballistics]]\n*[[Crime reconstruction]]\n*[[Evidence packaging]]\n\n== References

the [[forensic]] process of examining the characteristics of [[firearm]]s as well as any [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s or [[bullet]]s left behind at a [[crime scene]]. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) is the most common reagent used for this.  Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges. Fingerprints are key pieces of evidence. If crime scene investigators find prints at a scene, they will be dusted, photographed, collected, and analyzed both by hand (using comparison microscopes) as well as compared to databases for potential references.\n\nBy examining unique striations, scratches left behind on the bullet and weapon, individual fired rounds can be, but not always are, linked back to a specific weapon. These striations are due to the rifling inside the barrel of handguns. Rifling spins the bullet when it is shot out of the barrel to improve accuracy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heard |first=Brian |year=2013 |title=Forensic Ballistics in Court: Interpretation and Presentation of Firearms Evidence |location= |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781118505014 |pages=33\u201342}}</ref> Although striations are individualized evidence and will not match any other bullet or weapon, microscopic striations in the barrel of the weapon will change about every three to five shots. This is important because if attorneys wish to present ballistics evidence in court, it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one specific bullet would match one specific weapon. Forensic ballistics examiners may not fire more than five shots at most from a weapon found at a scene for this exact reason.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heard |first=Brian |year=2013 |title=Forensic Ballistics in Court: Interpretation and Presentation of Firearms Evidence |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-50501-4 |location= |pages=41}}</ref> Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a [[comparison microscope]] as well as newer 3-D imaging technology. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings can be compared to other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as [[expert witness]]es.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of [[rifling]] around the turn of the 16th century.<ref name=\"firearmsid\" />  By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] of the weapon the bullet's accuracy greatly increases.  At the same time, the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel.  Prior to mass production of firearms, each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by [[gunsmith]]s making them unique.<ref name=\"ABA\" />  The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the [[Bow Street Runners]] in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect's home confirming that he made the bullet.  Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted.<ref name=\"firearmsid\" />  As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools, the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company.  However, experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process. These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear, each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company.<ref name=\"ABA\" />  Also, each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks, allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet.<ref name=\"adaa\" />\n\nOne of the first uses of this knowledge was in 1915 to exonerate Charles Stielow of the murder of his neighbors.  Stielow was sentenced to death and appealed to [[Charles S. Whitman]], the Governor of New York, who was not convinced by the evidence used to convict Stielow.  Whitman halted the execution until an inquiry could be conducted and after further examination it was shown that Stielow's firearm could not have fired the bullets recovered from the victims.<ref name=\"Borchard\" /> The invention of the [[comparison microscope]] by [[Calvin Goddard (ballistics)|Calvin Goddard]] and [[Phillip O. Gravelle]] in 1925 modernized the forensic examination of firearms.<ref name=\"Cominvent\" /> Simultaneous comparison of two different objects at the same time allowed to closely examine striations for matches and therefore make a more definitive statement as to whether or not they matched.\n\nOne of the first true tests of this new technology was in the aftermath of the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] in 1929. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition Era]], competing gang members were fighting over [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] operations within the city of [[Chicago]]. Members of the [[Chicago Outfit]] and the [[Egan's Rats]] led by [[Al Capone]] attempted to remove all competition from Chicago by eliminating the [[North Side Gang]] leader [[Bugs Moran]].<ref name=\"Massacre2\" /><ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The massacre missed Moran, who was not present, but killed seven members of the North Side Gang. The murderers attempted to cover up their crime by posing as police officers, even dressing in police uniforms.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> Witnesses saw two \"officers\" leaving the scene, which implicated the Chicago police department as the perpetrators of the massacre. High levels of police corruption during that time period made it seem likely that the police department committed the killings.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The investigation stalled until December 1929 when [[Fred Burke]], a member of the Egan's Rats, shot and killed a police officer in [[St. Joseph, Michigan]]. Officers searching for Burke were led to a home in nearby [[Stevensville, Michigan|Stevensville]]. While Burke was not there, inside officers found an arsenal of weapons including two [[Thompson submachine gun]]s.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The Chicago police department was contacted and the weapons were brought back to Chicago for testing. Goddard was asked to compare the weapons to collected evidence found at the massacre using his new \"ballistic-forensics\" technique. After test firing the guns, Goddard proved that the weapons were those used to kill the members of the North Side Gang, absolving the Chicago police department of all involvement.<ref name=\"Massacre\" /> The successful use of Goddard's technique resulted in the solidification of his place as the father of forensic firearm examination.<ref name=\"father\" />\n\n== Examination of the firearm ==\n\n[[File:Pistol serial number.png|thumb|left|Multiple serial numbers provide redundancy and make it difficult to fully remove the numbers from a weapon.]]\nAny firearm collected during the course of an investigation could yield viable evidence if examined. For forensic firearm examination specific evidence that can be recovered include weapon [[serial number]]s and potentially [[fingerprint]]s left on the weapon's surface.\n\n===Fingerprint recovery===\n\nFingerprint recovery from the surface of firearms is done with [[cyanoacrylate]] (more commonly known as superglue) fuming.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /> Firearms are placed in a specially designed [[fume hood]] designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white.<ref name=\"BCAprint\" /> The resulting white print can be enhanced with [[fingerprint powder]] to increase the contrast of the white print against the weapon's finish.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /> While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons.<ref name=\"Fomagpring\" /><ref name=\"print diff\" />  If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever handled it. However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as [[allele]] drop-out and drop-in.<ref name=\"GunDNA\" />\n\n===Serial number recovery===\n\nSerial numbers became commonplace after the United States passed the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].  This law mandated that all guns manufactured in or imported into the country have a serial number.<ref name=\"GunAct\" />{{rp|1223}} Prior to 1968, many firearms either did not have a serial number or the serial numbers were not unique and were reused by a manufacturer on multiple firearms.<ref name=\"ATF\" />  If a recovered weapon has had the serial numbers altered or destroyed, examiners can attempt to recover the original numbers.  The two main methods for the restoration of serial numbers are [[magnetic particle inspection]] and chemical restoration.<ref name=\"restore\" />  It is recommended that magnetic particle inspection be performed first due to the [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] nature of the method.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" />  If magnetic particle inspection fails, chemical restoration is the next step in the forensic analysis.\n\nIf the serial number is successfully restored it can be used to help investigators track the weapon's history, as well as potentially determine who owns the weapon.  Firearm databases such as the [[National Crime Information Center]] of the United States and [[INTERPOL|INTERPOL's]] Firearm Reference Table can be used by investigators to track weapons that have been lost, stolen, or used previously in other crimes.<ref name=IFRT /><ref name=\"NCIC\" />\n\n====Magnetic particle inspection====\n\nOriginally developed as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in [[Ferromagnetism|magnetic]] materials, magnetic particle inspection can be used on firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" /> When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a [[magnetic field]]. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform.<ref name=\"MPIBook\" /> When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area.<ref name=\"MPIUV\" /> If [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] particles are added to the ferrous solution, [[ultraviolet light]] can be used to make it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.<ref name=\"MPIUV\" />\n\n====Chemical restoration====\n\nChemical restoration is a type of [[chemical milling]]. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until variations in the metal corresponding to the serial number are visible. This is possible because [[stamping (metalworking)|stamping]] the numbers distorts the [[grain boundary]] structure underneath the surface of the metal. However, chemical restoration is limited to that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial.<ref name=\"depth\" /> Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated.<ref name=\"acids\" /> The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an [[acid]],<ref name=\"acids\" /> that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from [[Fry's Reagent]] for a magnetic metal,<ref name=\"restore\" /> which is a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid]], [[cupric chloride]], and [[distilled water]],<ref name=\"Fry\" /> to an acidic [[ferric chloride]] solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.<ref name=\"restore\" />\n\n== Examination of cartridges ==\n[[File:Fired cartridge comparison.png|thumb|right|Two test-fired cartridges under magnification. Matching striations can be seen.]]\nSpent cartridges found at a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the various parts of the weapon including the [[firing pin]] and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|151}} The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a [[comparison microscope]]. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|152}}\n[[File:8digit_NanoTest.jpg|thumb|left|Example of microstamping. Insert shows a close up of the serial number imprinted into the cartridge.]]\nCartridges are also routinely examined for fingerprints as the act of loading the ammunition into the magazine, or chamber, leaves recoverable impressions.  These fingerprints can survive the firing processes and, while a rare occurrence, fingerprints have been obtained from cartridges recovered from the scene.<ref name=\"Cartprints\" /> Cartridges are subjected to cyanoacrylate fuming and examined for any usable prints. Usable prints are photographed and can be uploaded to fingerprint databases such as IAFIS for comparison with known exemplars. Cartridges can also be swabbed for trace DNA left by the individual who loaded the magazine. The extremely low levels of recoverable DNA present the same issues as swabbing a firearm for DNA.<ref name=\"GunDNA\" />\n\nAdvancements in microscopic stamping have led to a push for the inclusion of firing pin [[microstamping]].<ref name=\"Stampreport\" />{{rp|16}} The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm.<ref name=\"Stampreport\" />{{rp|17}} The practice is not in use {{as of|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|lc=y}}, although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms.<ref name=\"Calstamplaw\" /> The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.<ref name=\"Nomicro\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n== Examination of bullets ==\n[[File:Marlin 35 rem 2.jpg|thumb|left|Rifling pattern for a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle showing a clockwise (right-handed) twist.]]\n\n===Class characteristics===\n\nPreliminary examination of the bullet can exclude a large number of weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures.<ref name=\"BulletBook\" />{{rp|32}} The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the [[caliber]] of the bullet, and the rifling twist.<ref name=\"ncdoj\" /> All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet.<ref name=\"ncdoj\" /> The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the [[rifling]] is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] which uses left-handed twists.<ref name=\"BulletBook\" />{{rp|29}} Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.\n\n===Individual characteristics===\nIn order to compare individual striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars are created by firing the weapon into a water tank.<ref name=\"FBIfirearms\" /> The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles.<ref name=\"Tankbook\" /> To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a [[shooting range|controlled range]] with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.<ref name=\"FBIfirearms\" />\n\nOnce a known exemplar is produced, the evidence sample can be compared to the known by examining both at the same time with a comparison microscope.  Striations that line up are examined more closely, looking for multiple consecutive matches. There is no set number of consecutive matches that equates to a match declaration, and examiners are trained to use the phrase \"sufficient agreement\" when testifying. The degree to which an examiner can make that determination is based on their training and expertise.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|153}}  All findings by examiners are subject to questioning by both sides, prosecution and defense, during testimony in court.\n\n==Striation databasing==\n\nBullets and casings found at a scene require a known example to compare to in order to match them to a weapon. Without a weapon, the striation pattern can be uploaded to a database such as the [[National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network]] (NIBIN) maintained by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] or the United Kingdom's [[National Ballistics Intelligence Service]] (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together.<ref name=\"NIBINNews\" /><ref name=\"BBCGun\" /> Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.<ref name=\"ATFHelp\" />\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nFirearm examiners have attempted to determine the shooter's position by the location of spent bullet casings. The use of ejection pattern studies were originally part of incident reconstruction and methods for determining shooter location continue to be explained in major crime scene examination books.<ref name=\"EjectionBook\" />  However, the validity of ejection pattern analysis has been brought into question by multiple studies that look at the [[reproducibility]] and end determination of shooter position by qualified examiners. Studies have shown that over 25% of spent casings land somewhere other than to the right and rear of the shooter.<ref name=\"ISJShooter\" /> This is the most commonly accepted location for where spent cartridge casings should fall, and the large percentage of casings that end up somewhere else raises concerns for the validity of the examination technique. Investigators should only present a location gained from an ejection pattern study as a tentative estimate when using the information in a courtroom setting.<ref name=\"ISJShooter\" />\n\nPrior to September 2005, [[comparative bullet-lead analysis]] was performed on bullets found at a scene that were too destroyed for striation comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet and compare it to seized bullets possessed by a suspect.<ref name=\"CBLA\" /> Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, there are not enough differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession.<ref name=\"Metallurgical\" /> An additional report in 2004 from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially \"misleading under the federal rules of evidence\".<ref name=\"CBLA\" /> In 2005, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] indicated that they would no longer be performing this type of analysis.<ref name=\"CBLA FBI\" />\n\nFurther criticism came from the 2009 NAS report on the current state of various forensic fields in the United States. The report's section on firearm examination focused on the lack of defined requirements that are necessary in order to determine \"matches\" between known and unknown striations.  The NAS stated that, \"sufficient studies have not been done to understand the reliability and repeatability of the methods.\"<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|154}} Without defined procedures on what is and what isn't considered \"sufficient agreement\" the report states that forensic firearm examination contains fundamental problems that need to be addressed by the forensic community through a set of repeatable scientific studies that outline standard operating procedures that should be adopted by all firearm examiners.<ref name=\"NASReport\" />{{rp|155}} Another report issued in 2016 by the [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] confirmed the NAS's findings, finding only one appropriately designed study that examined the rate of false positives and reliability amongst firearm examiners.<ref name=\"PCASTReport\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Ballistics]]\n*[[Crime reconstruction]]\n*[[Evidence packaging]]\n\n== References
