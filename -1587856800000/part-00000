The first three seasons and the first half of season four focuses on both the patrol and Intelligence officers, and shifts to focus on the Intelligence Unit from the second half of season four on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Chicago P.D. characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Hank Voight|Detective Sergeant Henry \"Hank\" Voight]], the enigmatic and often mercurial chief of the Chicago P.D.'s Intelligence Unit. Despite his brusque, tough exterior and take-no-prisoners approach to police work, he is loyal to the cops and detectives serving under him and highly dedicated to the victims of the crimes his unit investigates. He is first introduced in ''[[Chicago Fire (season 1)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a dirty cop who clashes with [[Chicago Fire Department|CFD]] [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Matthew Casey]] after Voight's son Justin causes an accident in which a teenager is paralyzed, and Casey, who was first on scene, had intended to testify that Justin was [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. He was arrested by Det. Antonio Dawson for trying to have Casey silenced by force, but was later released from prison and reinstated to the police force by Internal Affairs. As a result, many of Casey's colleagues disliked him and Casey's superior Chief Boden has a love-hate working relationship with him. It is eventually revealed in the ''Chicago Fire'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" that his dirty cop alter ego was part of an undercover operation to catch criminals and other dirty cops. Prior to taking command of Intelligence, Voight worked in the Gang Unit. His father Richard was a former CPD officer who was killed in the line of duty. Voight is a widower; his wife, Camille, died of cancer some years prior. His son, Justin, served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was killed in the last episode of season 3 while trying to help a friend. Hank took an interest in Erin Lindsay at 15 and raised her as his daughter.\n* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Antonio Dawson|Senior Detective Antonio Dawson]] (seasons 1\u20136), an Intelligence Unit detective who previously arrested Voight for harassment and has since worked alongside him. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to get criminals off the streets, as shown by the fact that he asked Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo, as he did not want it on his conscience. He and his ex-wife Laura have two children: Diego and Eva. He is the older brother of  ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' character [[Gabriela Dawson|Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson]].  In season 4, he is offered a job at the State's Attorney's Office as Lead Investigator, which he accepts. After becoming disillusioned with the job, he returns to the unit in the first episode of season 5. In season 6, Antonio struggles with recovering from a shoulder injury and dependency on the oxycodone he is taking for the pain. After a dealer he owes kidnaps, beats, and rapes his daughter, Antonio, high on oxy, kills him in revenge. Though Voight and Ruzek manage to cover up the incident as self-defense, and Antonio successfully recovers in rehab, mayor-hopeful Superintendent Brian Kelton later gets the case re-opened in order to take down the Intelligence Unit, and in the season finale, Antonio relapses after Ruzek is arrested after taking the blame for everything to protect him. In the season 7 premiere, it is revealed that Voight found Antonio and checked him into an off-the-books rehab clinic to get him clean again while also protecting his career. It was revealed several episodes later that Antonio resigned and moved to Puerto Rico to spend more time with his family.\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as [[Erin Lindsay|Detective Erin Lindsay]] (seasons 1\u20134),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sophia Bush Leaving Chicago PD After 4 Seasons|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|accessdate=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526115316/http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|archive-date=May 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> a tough Intelligence Unit detective and former [[confidential informant|CI]] whom Voight took under his wing when she was a juvenile delinquent.

The first three seasons and the first half of season four focuses on both the patrol and Intelligence officers, and shifts to focus on the Intelligence Unit from the second half of season four on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Chicago P.D. characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Hank Voight|Detective Sergeant Henry \"Hank\" Voight]], the enigmatic and often mercurial chief of the Chicago P.D.'s Intelligence Unit. Despite his brusque, tough exterior and take-no-prisoners approach to police work, he is loyal to the cops and detectives serving under him and highly dedicated to the victims of the crimes his unit investigates. He is first introduced in ''[[Chicago Fire (season 1)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a dirty cop who clashes with [[Chicago Fire Department|CFD]] [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Matthew Casey]] after Voight's son Justin causes an accident in which a teenager is paralyzed, and Casey, who was first on scene, had intended to testify that Justin was [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. He was arrested by Det. Antonio Dawson for trying to have Casey silenced by force, but was later released from prison and reinstated to the police force by Internal Affairs. As a result, many of Casey's colleagues disliked him and Casey's superior Chief Boden has a love-hate working relationship with him. It is eventually revealed in the ''Chicago Fire'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" that his dirty cop alter ego was part of an undercover operation to catch criminals and other dirty cops. Prior to taking command of Intelligence, Voight worked in the Gang Unit. His father Richard was a former CPD officer who was killed in the line of duty. Voight is a widower; his wife, Camille, died of cancer some years prior. His son, Justin, served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was killed in the last episode of season 3 while trying to help a friend. Hank took an interest in Erin Lindsay at 15 and raised her as his daughter.\n* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Antonio Dawson|Senior Detective Antonio Dawson]] (seasons 1\u20136), an Intelligence Unit detective who previously arrested Voight for harassment and has since worked alongside him. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to get criminals off the streets, as shown by the fact that he asked Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo, as he did not want it on his conscience. He and his ex-wife Laura have two children: Diego and Eva. He is the older brother of  ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' character [[Gabriela Dawson|Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson]].  In season 4, he is offered a job at the State's Attorney's Office as Lead Investigator, which he accepts. After becoming disillusioned with the job, he returns to the unit in the first episode of season 5. In season 6, Antonio struggles with recovering from a shoulder injury and dependency on the oxycodone he is taking for the pain. After a dealer he owes kidnaps, beats, and rapes his daughter, Antonio, high on oxy, kills him in revenge. Though Voight and Ruzek manage to cover up the incident as self-defense, and Antonio successfully recovers in rehab, mayor-hopeful Superintendent Brian Kelton later gets the case re-opened in order to take down the Intelligence Unit, and in the season finale, Antonio relapses after Ruzek is arrested after taking the blame for everything to protect him. In the season 7 premiere, it is revealed that Voight found Antonio and checked him into an off-the-books rehab clinic to get him clean again while also protecting his career. It was revealed several episodes later that Antonio resigned and moved to Puerto Rico to spend more time with his family.\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as [[Erin Lindsay|Detective Erin Lindsay]] (seasons 1\u20134),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sophia Bush Leaving Chicago PD After 4 Seasons|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|accessdate=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526115316/http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|archive-date=May 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> a tough Intelligence Unit detective and former [[confidential informant|CI]] whom Voight took under his wing when she was a juvenile delinquent.

The earliest odes in the English language, using the word in its strict form, were the ''Epithalamium'' and ''Prothalamium'' of [[Edmund Spenser]].\n\nIn the 17th century, the most important original odes in English were by [[Abraham Cowley]]. These were [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]], but had irregular line length patterns and rhyme schemes. Cowley based the principle of his [[Pindariques]] on an apparent misunderstanding of Pindar's metrical practice but, nonetheless, others widely imitated his style, with notable success by [[John Dryden]].\n\nWith Pindar's metre being better understood in the 18th century, the fashion for Pindaric odes faded, though there are notable actual Pindaric odes by [[Thomas Gray]], [http://www.thomasgray.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=pppo ''The Progress of Poesy''] and [http://www.thomasgray.org/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=bapo ''The Bard''].\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\nThe earth, and every common sight,\nTo me did seem\nApparelled in celestial light,\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore;\u2014\nTurn wheresoe'er I may,\nBy night or day,\nThe things which I have seen I now can see no more....\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\nThe Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar:\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\nFrom God, who is our home...\n</poem></blockquote>\n(Excerpt from Wordsworth's ''Intimations of Immortality'')\n\nAround 1800, [[William Wordsworth]] revived Cowley's  Pindarick for one of his finest poems, the ''[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality|Intimations of Immortality]]'' ode. Others also wrote odes: [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] who wrote odes with regular stanza patterns. Shelley's ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]'', written in fourteen line [[terza rima]] stanzas, is a major poem in the form. Perhaps the greatest odes of the 19th century, however, were Keats's ''Five Great Odes of 1819'', which included \"[[Ode to a Nightingale]]\", \"[[Ode on Melancholy]]\", \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\", \"[[Ode to Psyche]]\", and \"[[To Autumn]]\". After Keats, there have been comparatively few major odes in English. One major exception is the fourth verse of the poem ''[[Ode of Remembrance|For the Fallen]]'' by [[Laurence Binyon]], which is often known as ''The Ode to the Fallen'', or simply as ''The Ode''.\n\nW.H. Auden also wrote ''Ode'', one of the most popular poems from his earlier career when he lived in London, in opposition to people's ignorance over the reality of war. In an interview, Auden once stated that he had intended to title the poem ''My Silver Age'' in mockery of the supposedly imperial Golden age, however chose ''Ode'' as it seemed to provide a more sensitive exploration of warfare.\n\n''Ode on a Grecian Urn'', while an ekphrasis, also functions as an ode to the artistic beauty the narrator observes.

It is an elaborately structured [[poem]] praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally. A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the ''[[strophe]]'', the ''[[antistrophe]]'', and the ''[[epode]]''. Different forms such as the ''homostrophic ode'' and the ''irregular ode'' also enter.\n\nGreek odes were originally poetic pieces performed with musical accompaniment. As time passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions whether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always with accompaniment). The primary instruments used were the [[aulos]] and the [[lyre]] (the latter was the most revered instrument to the [[ancient Greeks]]).\n\nThere are three typical forms of odes: the Pindaric, Horatian, and irregular. Pindaric odes follow the form and style of [[Pindar]]. Horatian odes follow conventions of [[Horace]]; the [[Odes (Horace)|odes of Horace]] deliberately imitated the Greek lyricists such as [[Alcaeus (poet)|Alcaeus]] and [[Anacreon]]. Irregular odes use rhyme, but not the three-part form of the Pindaric ode, nor the two- or four-line [[stanza]] of the Horatian ode. The ode is a lyric poem. It conveys exalted and inspired emotions. It is a lyric in an elaborate form, expressed in a language that is imaginative, dignified and sincere. Like the lyric, an ode is of Greek origin.\n\n==English ode==\n\nThe lyrics can be on various themes.
