The two greatest cities, [[Mohenjo-daro]] and Harappa, emerged circa 2600&nbsp;BC along the [[Indus River]] valley in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | url = https://archive.org/details/mcdougallittellw00beck | url-access = registration | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | isbn = 978-0-395-87274-1 }}</ref> The civilisation, with a possible [[writing system]], urban centers, and diversified [[Social structure|social]] and [[economic system]], was rediscovered in the 1920s also after excavations at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Sindh near [[Larkana]], and Harappa, in west [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] south of [[Lahore]].

Although the archaeological site at Harappa was damaged in 1857<ref>Michel Danino. The Lost River.

As early as 1826 Harappa, located in west Punjab, attracted the attention of [[Daya Ram Sahni]], who gets credit for preliminary excavations of Harappa.\n\n==Culture and economy==\n\nThe Indus Valley civilisation was mainly an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce, the latter including trade with [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]]. Both [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and Harappa are generally characterized as having \"differentiated living quarters, flat-roofed brick houses, and fortified administrative or religious centers.\"<ref name=loc>Library of Congress: Country Studies. 1995.

Retrieved 13 January 2006.</ref> Although such similarities have given rise to arguments for the existence of a standardized system of urban layout and planning, the similarities are largely due to the presence of a semi-orthogonal type of civic layout, and a comparison of the layouts of [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and Harappa shows that they are in fact, arranged in a quite dissimilar fashion.\n\nThe weights and measures of the Indus Valley Civilisation, on the other hand, were highly standardized, and conform to a set scale of gradations. Distinctive seals were used, among other applications, perhaps for identification of property and shipment of goods. Although copper and [[bronze]] were in use, [[Iron (material)|iron]] was not yet employed. \"Cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were [[Agriculture|cultivated]]; and a number of animals, including the [[Brahman (cattle)|humped bull]], were [[Domestication|domesticated]],\"<ref name=\"loc\" /> as well as \"[[fighting cock|fowl for fighting]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8xHK6ibUMYC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Harappa+cock+fight&source=bl&ots=0iVMnkD9m5&sig=RBt1SvGwwTAgeu-PqZzEhvY-bAk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JiEfUL35CYSQ9gTL3oDwAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Harappa%20cock%20fight&f=false] Poultry: Identification, Fabrication, Utilization by Thomas Schneller \u2013 Cengage Learning, 28 September 2009 \u2013 page 16</ref>  Wheel-made pottery\u2014some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs\u2014has been found in profusion at all the major Indus sites.

Some of the most valuable things traded were [[carnelian]] and [[lapis lazuli]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together, Worlds Apart|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Norton|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-393-92207-3|location = New York|page = 67}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that Harappan society was not entirely peaceful, with the human skeletal remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory.<ref>{{cite journal|url =  | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2012.09.012 | pmid=29539378 | volume=2 | issue=2\u20133 | title=A peaceful realm?

A large number of seals have been found at such sites as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. Many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or script.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, and despite the use of modern [[cryptography|cryptographic analysis]], the [[Indus script|signs]] remain undeciphered. It is also unknown if they reflect proto-[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] or other non-[[Vedic period|Vedic]] language(s). The ascribing of Indus Valley Civilisation [[iconography]] and [[epigraphy]] to historically known cultures is extremely problematic, in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence for such claims, as well as the projection of modern South Asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area. This is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of Harappan material culture as seen from both Pakistan- and India-based scholars.{{or?|date=July 2019}}{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn February 2006 a school teacher in the village of Sembian-Kandiyur in [[Tamil Nadu]] discovered a stone [[celt (tool)]] with an inscription estimated to be up to 3,500 years old.<ref name=\"The Hindu_century\">{{cite news | last=Subramaniam | first=T.

Distinctive seals were used, among other applications, perhaps for identification of property and shipment of goods. Although copper and [[bronze]] were in use, [[Iron (material)|iron]] was not yet employed. \"Cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were [[Agriculture|cultivated]]; and a number of animals, including the [[Brahman (cattle)|humped bull]], were [[Domestication|domesticated]],\"<ref name=\"loc\" /> as well as \"[[fighting cock|fowl for fighting]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8xHK6ibUMYC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Harappa+cock+fight&source=bl&ots=0iVMnkD9m5&sig=RBt1SvGwwTAgeu-PqZzEhvY-bAk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JiEfUL35CYSQ9gTL3oDwAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Harappa%20cock%20fight&f=false] Poultry: Identification, Fabrication, Utilization by Thomas Schneller \u2013 Cengage Learning, 28 September 2009 \u2013 page 16</ref>  Wheel-made pottery\u2014some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs\u2014has been found in profusion at all the major Indus sites.

A large number of seals have been found at such sites as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. Many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or script.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, and despite the use of modern [[cryptography|cryptographic analysis]], the [[Indus script|signs]] remain undeciphered. It is also unknown if they reflect proto-[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] or other non-[[Vedic period|Vedic]] language(s). The ascribing of Indus Valley Civilisation [[iconography]] and [[epigraphy]] to historically known cultures is extremely problematic, in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence for such claims, as well as the projection of modern South Asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area.

A paved path, exposed at low water, allows easy access.

At high tide the path is covered by several feet of seawater which cuts the island off from the mainland. It is safe to walk along the raised causeway to the island at low tide, but only if visitors ensure that they leave enough time to return to the mainland before the water rises. The speed at which the tide comes in can easily trap the unwary. A large signpost (located at the start of the causeway) warns visitors of the danger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s1cramond.com/news/fresh-warnings-surrounding-cramond-island-after-two-teenagers-get-stranded-twice.html |title=Fresh warnings surrounding Cramond Island after two teenagers get stranded twice |publisher=s1Cramond |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021083343/http://www.s1cramond.com/news/fresh-warnings-surrounding-cramond-island-after-two-teenagers-get-stranded-twice.html |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> If this warning is ignored, there can be serious accidents<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13047525.toddler-saved-in-causeway-drama/ |title=Toddler saved in causeway drama |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2019 |publisher=The Herald, Glasgow}} p. 4</ref> or people may be stranded on the island until the next low tide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnli.org.uk/who_we_are/press_centre/news_releases/news_release_detail?articleid=642889 |title=RNLI Queensferry lifeboat rescues three adults & child trapped on Cramond Island |publisher=Rnli.org.uk |accessdate=2 March 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dyadxeue?url=http://rnli.org/NewsCentre/Pages/default.aspx?link=header%2F%3Ftab%3DNews-releases |archive-date=27 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name = \"cramond revellers\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_east_and_fife/10248503.stm |title='Social networking' revellers stranded on tiny island |publisher=BBC News |date= 6 June 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-21989975 |title='Incoming tide traps Cramond Island walkers |publisher=BBC News |date= 31 March 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> In 2011, a Daniel Defoe of [[Livingston, West Lothian]] and an unidentified female found themselves trapped on the island due to miscalculating the times of the tide.

The island was once famous for its [[oyster]] beds, but these were destroyed due to overfishing. In the north west corner of the island there are remains of a [[jetty]] built with local stone which could be [[medieval]] in origin, while towards the centre of the island, half-hidden by a small wood there is the ruin of a stone-built [[farmstead]]. It appears on an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1853, but may be considerably older. It was occupied until the 1930s and sheep were still kept on the island as late as the 1960s.\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn 1914 a 'Middle Line' of defences was established across the Firth of Forth, to protect an anchorage for warships between the line and the [[Forth Bridge]]. An anti-submarine net ran from Cramond Island to Inchmickery, to Inchcolm and to the Fife coast. The three islands were armed with 14 x 12-pdr guns, two of which were mounted on Cramond.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Cramond island ww2 defences.jpg|thumb|WW2-era fortifications on Cramond Island]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Cramond Island, along with other islands in the Forth, was re[[fortified]] and armed with two 12-pdr guns, and a modern 6-pdr twin equipment, designed specifically to tackle fast-moving torpedo boats. An anti-submarine net and anti-boat boom was laid across the estuary from Cramond Island directly to Inchcolm, and then to the Charles Hill battery on the Fife coast. The barrier was to protect ships in the anchorage from attack by torpedo boats, and to stop submarines entering the anchorage to attack shipping or to damage the dock gate of [[Rosyth Dockyard]]. The line of concrete pylons was built from Cramond Island to the shore to complete the anti-boat barrier (which is often misidentified as an anti-submarine barrier - the water is far too shallow). After crossing the causeway, the first structures are the emplacements for a 75&nbsp;mm gun and its associated [[searchlight]]. Several WW2 buildings survive, including the housings for Coast Artillery Search Lights, stores, shelters and gun emplacements, as well as two engine rooms that once contained all the equipment necessary to supply power to the military installations on the island. The anchor points for the anti-submarine net and anti-boat boom are visible at the north end of the island at low tide.\n\nFurther along the northern coast, low concrete stumps protrude from the undergrowth, all that remain of the [[barracks]] that housed the [[garrison]] on the island.\n\nOn the western side is a small brick building of unknown purpose. Nearby, perched precariously on the rocky shore is the ruin of a small square building which was used as an [[ammunition]] store during the war, though its stone construction suggests it is much older than either World War, possibly contemporary with the farmstead in the middle of the island.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Scottish islands}}\n* [[List of islands of Scotland]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cramond Island}}\n* [http://www.ntslf.org/tides/tidepred?port=Leith Tide Times]\n\n{{Islands of the Forth}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Islands of the Forth]]\n[[Category:Tidal islands of Scotland]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A tidal island in the Firth of Forth in eastern Scotland}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox Scottish island\n|coordinates = {{coord|55.9930|N|3.2898|W|region:GB_type:isle|display=inline,title}}\n| Image=  Cramond_Island_from_air.JPG\n| ImageCaption= Cramond Island from the air\n|location_map=United Kingdom Edinburgh\n|caption=Location of  the island in City of Edinburgh\n|GridReference=\n|celtic name=Eilean Chathair Amain\n|norse name=\n|meaning of name=\n|area=   7.70 [[hectares|ha]]\n|area rank=\n|highest elevation=   \n|Population=\n|population rank=\n|main settlement=\n|island group=[[Islands of the Forth]]\n|local authority=\n|references=\n}}\n[[File:WW2 Anti-submarine fence - geograph.org.uk - 365678.jpg|thumb|Cramond Island with causeway on left and anti-boat pylons on right]]\n[[File:The Causeway line at high tide - geograph.org.uk - 224346.jpg|thumb|Line of causeway and pylons at high tide]]\n\n'''Cramond Island''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]] '''Eilean Chathair Amain''') is one of several islands in the [[Firth of Forth]] in eastern [[Scotland]], near [[Edinburgh]].

Johnstone</ref> The island is part of the [[Dalmeny House|Dalmeny]] Estate, owned by the Rosebery Estates Partnership, and is let to Cramond Boat Club.\n\n==Geography==\nCramond Island is a [[tidal island]] about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) out to sea, which is connected to the mainland at low tide across the Drum Sands. A paved path, exposed at low water, allows easy access. This causeway runs at the foot of a row of concrete pylons on one side of the causeway, which were constructed as an [[Boom (navigational barrier)|anti-boat boom]] during the [[Second World War]] and are one of the most striking sights in the area. At high tide the path is covered by several feet of seawater which cuts the island off from the mainland. It is safe to walk along the raised causeway to the island at low tide, but only if visitors ensure that they leave enough time to return to the mainland before the water rises. The speed at which the tide comes in can easily trap the unwary. A large signpost (located at the start of the causeway) warns visitors of the danger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s1cramond.com/news/fresh-warnings-surrounding-cramond-island-after-two-teenagers-get-stranded-twice.html |title=Fresh warnings surrounding Cramond Island after two teenagers get stranded twice |publisher=s1Cramond |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021083343/http://www.s1cramond.com/news/fresh-warnings-surrounding-cramond-island-after-two-teenagers-get-stranded-twice.html |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> If this warning is ignored, there can be serious accidents<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13047525.toddler-saved-in-causeway-drama/ |title=Toddler saved in causeway drama |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2019 |publisher=The Herald, Glasgow}} p. 4</ref> or people may be stranded on the island until the next low tide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnli.org.uk/who_we_are/press_centre/news_releases/news_release_detail?articleid=642889 |title=RNLI Queensferry lifeboat rescues three adults & child trapped on Cramond Island |publisher=Rnli.org.uk |accessdate=2 March 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dyadxeue?url=http://rnli.org/NewsCentre/Pages/default.aspx?link=header%2F%3Ftab%3DNews-releases |archive-date=27 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name = \"cramond revellers\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_east_and_fife/10248503.stm |title='Social networking' revellers stranded on tiny island |publisher=BBC News |date= 6 June 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-21989975 |title='Incoming tide traps Cramond Island walkers |publisher=BBC News |date= 31 March 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> In 2011, a Daniel Defoe of [[Livingston, West Lothian]] and an unidentified female found themselves trapped on the island due to miscalculating the times of the tide.
