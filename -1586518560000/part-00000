Examples of this influence include the techniques of a [[side story]], [[back-story]] and [[story within a story]]. Indian popular films often have plots that branch into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films ''[[Khalnayak]]'' and ''[[Gardish]]''.\n*Ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], with its emphasis on spectacle, combined [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combined \"to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience\". Sanskrit dramas were known as ''[[Natya Shastra|natya]]'', derived from the root word ''nrit'' (dance), featuring spectacular dance-dramas.<ref name=\"Gokulsing-98\"/> The ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]'' method of performance, dating to ancient times, is one of the fundamental features that differentiate Indian from Western cinema. In the ''Rasa'' method, [[Empathy|empathetic]] \"emotions are conveyed by the performer and thus felt by the audience\", in contrast to the Western [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski method]] where the actor must become \"a living, breathing embodiment of a character\" rather than \"simply conveying emotion\". The ''rasa'' method is apparent in the performances of Hindi actors such as Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan and in Hindi films such as ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006),<ref name=\"Jones\">{{Cite journal|title=Bollywood, Rasa and Indian Cinema: Misconceptions, Meanings and Millionaire|author=Matthew Jones|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 2010|pages=33\u201343|doi=10.1080/08949460903368895}}</ref> and Ray's works.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000 1-4\">{{cite book|title=The Cinema of Satyajit Ray: Between Tradition and Modernity|last=Cooper|first=Darius|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-62980-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cinemaofsatyajit00coop/page/1 1\u20134]|url=https://archive.org/details/cinemaofsatyajit00coop/page/1}}</ref>\n*Traditional folk [[theatre of India|theatre]] became popular around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the [[Yatra]] of [[West Bengal]], the [[Ramlila]] of Uttar Pradesh, [[Yakshagana]] of Karnataka, 'Chindu Natakam' of Andhra Pradesh and the [[Terukkuttu]] of Tamil Nadu.\n*[[Parsi theatre]] \"blended [[realism (arts)|realism]] and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.\"<ref name=\"Gokulsing-98\">{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

Indian musical makers departed from their Hollywood counterparts in several ways. \"For example, the Hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself. Indian filmmakers, while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in Indian popular films, used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films. There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, fairy stories and so on through song and dance.\" In addition, \"whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day-to-day lives in complex and interesting ways.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

An early example of this approach was ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' (1995, Mani Ratnam).<ref>{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

In the early 20th century, [[Urdu]] was the [[lingua franca]] of popular performances across northern India, established in [[performance art]] traditions such as [[nautch]] dancing, [[Urdu poetry]] and Parsi theatre. Urdu and related [[Hindi dialects]] were the most widely understood across northern India, thus [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] became the standardised language of early Indian [[talkies]]. ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'') had a strong influence on Parsi theatre, which adapted \"[[Persianate]] adventure-romances\" into films, and on early Bombay cinema where \"''Arabian Nights'' cinema\" became a popular genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gooptu|first=Sharmistha|title=Bengali Cinema: 'An Other Nation'|date=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136912177|page=38|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DcUtCgAAQBAJ|page=38}}|language=en}}</ref> Stadtman identifies foreign influences on commercial Bollywood [[masala film]]s: [[New Hollywood]], [[Hong Kong martial arts cinema]] and Italian [[exploitation film]]s.<ref name=\"funky\">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Todd|title=Funky Bollywood: The Wild World of 1970s Indian Action Cinema|date=2015|publisher=FAB Press|isbn=9781903254776|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=T0DXoQEACAAJ}}|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLike mainstream Indian popular cinema, Indian [[Parallel Cinema]] was influenced by a combination of Indian theatre and [[Indian literature]] (such as [[Bengali literature]] and Urdu poetry), but differs when it comes to foreign influences, where it is influenced more by [[European cinema]] (particularly [[Italian neorealism]] and French [[poetic realism]]) than by Hollywood. Ray cited [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948) and [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951), on which he assisted, as influences on his debut film ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]'' (1955).\n\n== Influence of cinema of India ==\nDuring colonial rule Indians bought film equipment from Europe.<ref name=\"Burra&Rao252-253\"/> The British funded wartime propaganda films during [[World War II]], some of which showed the [[Indian Army (1895\u20131947)|Indian army]] pitted against the [[Axis powers]], specifically the [[Empire of Japan]], which had managed to infiltrate India.<ref name=\"Velayutham174\">Velayutham, 174</ref> One such story was ''[[Burma Rani]]'', which depicted civilian resistance to [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese occupation]] by British and Indian forces in Myanmar.<ref name=Velayutham174/> Pre-independence businessmen such as J.

Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, while making his maiden film, had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the screenwriter, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director. The film, completed with a budget of 60,000 rupees, was released on 10 March 1935. The picture failed miserably. Like many early films, the negatives and prints of ''Joymati'' are missing. Some effort has been made privately by Altaf Mazid to restore and subtitle what is left of the prints. Despite the significant financial loss from ''Joymati'', a second picture, ''Indramalati'', was released in 1939. The 21st century has produced Bollywood-style Assamese movies.<ref>Lakshmi B.

This region's debut was a full-length black and white film ''Matamgee Manipur'' ( 1972). Meitei cinema started in the 1980s. ''Langlen Thadoi'' (1984) was Meitei cinema's first full-length colour film.\n\nMeitei cinema gained momentum following a ban on the screening of Hindi films in entertainment houses in Manipur. Screening of Hindi movies came to a halt despite reiterated appeals made by successive Chief Ministers. 80-100 movies are made each year. Cinemas opened in Imphal after World War II. The first full-length Meitei movie was made in 1972, followed by a boom in 2002.\n\n''Imagi Ningthem'' ([[Aribam Syam Sharma]]) won the Grand Prix in the 1992 [[Nantes]] International Film Festival. A nationwide French telecast of ''Imagi Ningthem'' expanded the audience. After watching ''[[The Chosen One (1990 film)|Ishanou]]'' ([[Aribam Syam Sharma]]), westerners began research on [[Lai Haraoba]] and Manipur's rich folklore. ''Maipak, Son of Manipur'' (1971) was the first Meitei documentary film.\n\nAmong the notable [[Meitei cinema|Meitei films]] are ''[[Phijigee Mani]]'', ''Leipaklei'' and ''[[Pallepfam]]''.\n\n=== Marathi ===\n{{Main|Marathi cinema}}\n\nMarathi films are produced in the [[Marathi language]] in Maharashtra.

Examples of this influence include the techniques of a [[side story]], [[back-story]] and [[story within a story]]. Indian popular films often have plots that branch into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films ''[[Khalnayak]]'' and ''[[Gardish]]''.\n*Ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], with its emphasis on spectacle, combined [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combined \"to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience\". Sanskrit dramas were known as ''[[Natya Shastra|natya]]'', derived from the root word ''nrit'' (dance), featuring spectacular dance-dramas.<ref name=\"Gokulsing-98\"/> The ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]'' method of performance, dating to ancient times, is one of the fundamental features that differentiate Indian from Western cinema. In the ''Rasa'' method, [[Empathy|empathetic]] \"emotions are conveyed by the performer and thus felt by the audience\", in contrast to the Western [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski method]] where the actor must become \"a living, breathing embodiment of a character\" rather than \"simply conveying emotion\". The ''rasa'' method is apparent in the performances of Hindi actors such as Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan and in Hindi films such as ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006),<ref name=\"Jones\">{{Cite journal|title=Bollywood, Rasa and Indian Cinema: Misconceptions, Meanings and Millionaire|author=Matthew Jones|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 2010|pages=33\u201343|doi=10.1080/08949460903368895}}</ref> and Ray's works.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000 1-4\">{{cite book|title=The Cinema of Satyajit Ray: Between Tradition and Modernity|last=Cooper|first=Darius|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-62980-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cinemaofsatyajit00coop/page/1 1\u20134]|url=https://archive.org/details/cinemaofsatyajit00coop/page/1}}</ref>\n*Traditional folk [[theatre of India|theatre]] became popular around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the [[Yatra]] of [[West Bengal]], the [[Ramlila]] of Uttar Pradesh, [[Yakshagana]] of Karnataka, 'Chindu Natakam' of Andhra Pradesh and the [[Terukkuttu]] of Tamil Nadu.\n*[[Parsi theatre]] \"blended [[realism (arts)|realism]] and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.\"<ref name=\"Gokulsing-98\">{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

Indian musical makers departed from their Hollywood counterparts in several ways. \"For example, the Hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself. Indian filmmakers, while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in Indian popular films, used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films. There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, fairy stories and so on through song and dance.\" In addition, \"whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day-to-day lives in complex and interesting ways.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

An early example of this approach was ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' (1995, Mani Ratnam).<ref>{{cite book| last = K. Moti Gokulsing| first = K.

In the early 20th century, [[Urdu]] was the [[lingua franca]] of popular performances across northern India, established in [[performance art]] traditions such as [[nautch]] dancing, [[Urdu poetry]] and Parsi theatre. Urdu and related [[Hindi dialects]] were the most widely understood across northern India, thus [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] became the standardised language of early Indian [[talkies]]. ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'') had a strong influence on Parsi theatre, which adapted \"[[Persianate]] adventure-romances\" into films, and on early Bombay cinema where \"''Arabian Nights'' cinema\" became a popular genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gooptu|first=Sharmistha|title=Bengali Cinema: 'An Other Nation'|date=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136912177|page=38|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DcUtCgAAQBAJ|page=38}}|language=en}}</ref> Stadtman identifies foreign influences on commercial Bollywood [[masala film]]s: [[New Hollywood]], [[Hong Kong martial arts cinema]] and Italian [[exploitation film]]s.<ref name=\"funky\">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Todd|title=Funky Bollywood: The Wild World of 1970s Indian Action Cinema|date=2015|publisher=FAB Press|isbn=9781903254776|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=T0DXoQEACAAJ}}|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLike mainstream Indian popular cinema, Indian [[Parallel Cinema]] was influenced by a combination of Indian theatre and [[Indian literature]] (such as [[Bengali literature]] and Urdu poetry), but differs when it comes to foreign influences, where it is influenced more by [[European cinema]] (particularly [[Italian neorealism]] and French [[poetic realism]]) than by Hollywood. Ray cited [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948) and [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951), on which he assisted, as influences on his debut film ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]'' (1955).\n\n== Influence of cinema of India ==\nDuring colonial rule Indians bought film equipment from Europe.<ref name=\"Burra&Rao252-253\"/> The British funded wartime propaganda films during [[World War II]], some of which showed the [[Indian Army (1895\u20131947)|Indian army]] pitted against the [[Axis powers]], specifically the [[Empire of Japan]], which had managed to infiltrate India.<ref name=\"Velayutham174\">Velayutham, 174</ref> One such story was ''[[Burma Rani]]'', which depicted civilian resistance to [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese occupation]] by British and Indian forces in Myanmar.<ref name=Velayutham174/> Pre-independence businessmen such as J.

Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, while making his maiden film, had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the screenwriter, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director. The film, completed with a budget of 60,000 rupees, was released on 10 March 1935. The picture failed miserably. Like many early films, the negatives and prints of ''Joymati'' are missing. Some effort has been made privately by Altaf Mazid to restore and subtitle what is left of the prints. Despite the significant financial loss from ''Joymati'', a second picture, ''Indramalati'', was released in 1939. The 21st century has produced Bollywood-style Assamese movies.<ref>Lakshmi B.

This region's debut was a full-length black and white film ''Matamgee Manipur'' ( 1972). Meitei cinema started in the 1980s. ''Langlen Thadoi'' (1984) was Meitei cinema's first full-length colour film.\n\nMeitei cinema gained momentum following a ban on the screening of Hindi films in entertainment houses in Manipur. Screening of Hindi movies came to a halt despite reiterated appeals made by successive Chief Ministers. 80-100 movies are made each year. Cinemas opened in Imphal after World War II. The first full-length Meitei movie was made in 1972, followed by a boom in 2002.\n\n''Imagi Ningthem'' ([[Aribam Syam Sharma]]) won the Grand Prix in the 1992 [[Nantes]] International Film Festival. A nationwide French telecast of ''Imagi Ningthem'' expanded the audience. After watching ''[[The Chosen One (1990 film)|Ishanou]]'' ([[Aribam Syam Sharma]]), westerners began research on [[Lai Haraoba]] and Manipur's rich folklore. ''Maipak, Son of Manipur'' (1971) was the first Meitei documentary film.\n\nAmong the notable [[Meitei cinema|Meitei films]] are ''[[Phijigee Mani]]'', ''Leipaklei'' and ''[[Pallepfam]]''.\n\n=== Marathi ===\n{{Main|Marathi cinema}}\n\nMarathi films are produced in the [[Marathi language]] in Maharashtra.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 92 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

The GBMZ, in turn, is covered by [[Paleozoic]] and [[Proterozoic]] sediments and, as indicated by a long [[Aeromagnetic survey|aeromagnetic line]], the sub-aerial part of the GMBZ is probably {{Convert|800|km|abbr=on}} long.  Volcanics of the GBMZ range from [[basalt]] to [[rhyolite]] and geologic studies show it is part of an early Proterozoic continental [[volcanic arc]].<ref name=\"Hildebrand-etal-1984-p73\" />\n\n==Geologic history==\nThe GBMZ formed following a flip in subduction polarity from east to west dipping when the [[Hottah terrane]] collided with the [[Slave Craton]] 1.875\u20131.855&nbsp;Ga.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ootes|Goff|Jackson|Gleeson|2010|p=551}}</ref>\n\nThe GBMZ is a magmatic arc on the western margin of the Wopmay orogen which developed 1.875\u20131.840&nbsp;Ga on older Proterozoic basement rocks. The medial or internal zone of the orogen form the eastern margin of the GBMZ and is marked by the complex Wopmay fault zone which the GBMZ partly covers in the north.<ref name=\"Gandhi-etal-2000-p4\">{{Harvnb|Gandhi|Carri\u00e8re|Prasad|2000|loc=Regional Geological Setting, p. 4}}</ref>\n\nThe early history of the GBMZ (1.870\u20131.865&nbsp;Ga) was dominated by volcanism and intrusions that produced a stratum of volcanic rocks {{Convert|10|km|abbr=on}} thick in the north to {{Convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in the south.  The volcanic layers in the north are folded and have been intruded by quartz [[monzonite]] [[pluton]]s.  Large granite [[batholith]]s were emplaced during late stages of volcanism (1.865\u20131.840&nbsp;Ga). The GBMZ at this stage is thought to be the result of eastward-directed subduction of oceanic lithosphere.<ref name=\"Gandhi-etal-2000-p4\" />\n\nThis was followed by a collision with a microcontinent in the west. A system of brittle faults developed, the most prominent of which form a set of north-east-trending right-lateral faults with a length varying from hundred metres to several kilometres.  Topographically the GBMZ is characterised by granitic low relief areas with former volcanoes forming {{Convert|150|m|abbr=on}}-high hills.<ref name=\"Gandhi-etal-2000-p4\" />\n\nSeveral plate tectonic reconstructions propose an Archean-Paleoproterozoic connection between the cratonic core of North America, the continent [[Laurentia]], and that of Siberia, the continent [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], based on geological connections and [[Paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] evidence.  For example, in the reconstruction of {{Harvnb|Rainbird|Stern|Khudoley|Kropachev|1998}} Angara in Siberia matches the Wopmay orogen and the GBMZ in Laurentia; and the Aktikan fold belt in Siberia matches the Thelon-Taltson belt in Laurentia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rainbird|Stern|Khudoley|Kropachev|1998|loc=Conclusions, p. 418}}</ref>  Several other tectonic models have been proposed, however, and the possible connections between the two early continents remain controversial.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zhao|Cawood|Wilde|Sun|2002|loc=Siberia and Laurentia, pp. 149\u2013152; fig. 20, p. 151}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial geology==\nThe GBMZ hosts [[polymetal]]lic and [[iron-oxide]]-rich deposits many of which include [[magnetite]]\u2013[[apatite]]\u2013[[actinolite]] veins, making the GBMZ attractive for [[Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits|IOCG]] exploration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ootes|Goff|Jackson|Gleeson|2010|loc=Introduction, p. 550}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Taltson Magmatic Zone]]\n*[[Volcanism of Canada]]\n*[[Volcanism of Northern Canada]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal\n | last1 = Gandhi | first1 = S.

{"title_page": "Private banking", "text_new": "{{Short description|Banking services for very wealthy people}}{{Banking |terms}}\n'''Private banking''' is [[bank]]ing, [[investment]] and other [[financial services]] provided by banks and financial services firms primarily to [[high-net-worth individual]]s (HNWIs) with high levels of income or sizable assets and increasingly the Mass Affluent market as well. \n\nPrivate banking forms a more exclusive (for the especially affluent) subset of [[wealth management]]. The term \"private\" refers to customer service rendered on a more personal basis than in mass-market [[retail banking]], usually via dedicated bank advisers. It does not refer to a [[private bank]], which is a non-incorporated banking institution.\n\nAt least until recently, it largely consisted of banking services (deposit taking and payments), [[Managed account|discretionary asset management]], brokerage, limited tax advisory services and some basic [[concierge]]-type services, offered by a single designated relationship manager.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe first private banks, the way we think of them today, were formed in Florence in the 14th century. It is commonly accepted that the first private Bank was established between 1348 and 1392 by Vieri di Cambio de\u2019 Medici of the Medici family of merchants.  Other family-owned private banks were established in Italy at that time, none of which still exists presently.  The oldest bank still in existence is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, headquartered in Siena, Italy (45 miles or 72 Km. away from Florence) which has been operating continuously since 1472 also in private banking.\n<ref>{{cite news| title =Private Banking History | publisher = Privatni Bankovnictvi| url =https://privatnibankovnictvi.eu/en/bank-guide/private-banking/history-private-banking/}}</ref>\n\nPrivate banks came to be known as \"private\" to stand out from the retail banking and [[savings bank]]s aimed at the new [[middle class]]. Traditionally, private banks were linked to families for several generations. They often advised and performed all financial and banking services for these families. Historically, private banking has developed in Europe (see the [[Private bank#List of private banks|List of private banks]]). Some banks in Europe are known for managing the assets of some royal families. The assets of the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]] are managed by [[LGT Group]] (founded in 1920 and originally known as The Liechtenstein Global Trust). The assets of the [[Dutch royal family]] are managed by [[MeesPierson]] (founded in 1720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abnamro.com/en/about-abn-amro/history/history-downloads/index.html|title=History|author=|date=|website=www.abnamro.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> The assets of the [[British Royal Family]] are managed by [[Coutts]] (founded in 1692).\n\nHistorically, private banking has been viewed as a very exclusive niche that only caters to HNWIs with liquidity over $2 million, though it is now possible to open private banking accounts with as little as $250,000 for private investors. An institution's private banking division provides services such as wealth management, savings, inheritance, and tax planning for their clients. For private banking services, clients pay either based on the number of transactions, the annual portfolio performance or a \"flat-fee\", usually calculated as a yearly percentage of the total investment amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myprivatebanking.com/article/advice-cut-your-costs-of-wealth-management-part-2|title=Understanding Cost Drivers and Pricing Models in Wealth Management and Private Banking- MyPrivateBanking|author=|date=|website=www.myprivatebanking.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Private\" also alludes to [[bank secrecy]] and minimizing taxes through careful allocation of assets, or by hiding assets from the taxing authorities. [[Swiss bank|Swiss]] and certain [[offshore bank]]s have been criticized for such cooperation with individuals practicing tax evasion. Although ''[[tax fraud]]'' is a criminal offense in Switzerland, ''tax evasion'' is only a [[civil law (common law)|civil offence]], not requiring banks to notify taxing authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032801801.html|title=Facing Pressure Over Banking-Secrecy Tradition, Switzerland Braces for Fight|first=Craig|last=Whitlock|date=29 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Switzerland, there are many banks providing private banking services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-14/swiss-banks-buck-secrecy-squeeze-with-net-customer-inflows-of-53-billion|title=Swiss Banks Buck Secrecy Squeeze With $53 Billion of Inflows|author=|date=14 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> Switzerland has remained neutral since the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, including through two World Wars. After World War I, the former nobles of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] moved their assets to Switzerland for fear of confiscation by new governments.<ref>''The Swiss banks'' by [[T. R. Fehrenbach]]</ref> During World War II, many wealthy people, including Jewish families and institutions, moved their assets into Switzerland to protect them from Nazi Germany. However, this transfer of wealth into Switzerland had mixed and controversial results, as beneficiaries had difficulties retrieving their assets after the war.<ref>''Hitler's Secret Bankers'' by [[Adam LeBor]]</ref> After World War II, in eastern Europe, assets were again moved into Switzerland for fear of confiscation by communist governments. \n\nToday, Switzerland remains the largest offshore center, with about 27 percent ($2.0 trillion) of global offshore wealth in 2009, according to [[Boston Consulting Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/offshore_business_recovered_challenges_remain/|title=The Offshore Business Has Recovered\u2014but Challenges Remain|author=|date=|website=bcgperspectives.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Offshore wealth is defined as assets booked in a country where the investor has no legal residence or tax domicile.\n\nIn England, private banks were established in the 17th century, in parallel with the development of agriculture, managing the assets of the royal family, nobility and the landed gentry.\n\nThe United States has one of the largest private banking systems in the world, in part due to the 3.1 million HNWIs accounting for 28.6% of the global HNWIs population in 2010, according to the co-research of [[Capgemini]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. Some American banks that specialize in private banking date back to the 19th century, such as [[U.S. Trust]] (founded in 1853) and [[Northern Trust]] (founded in 1889).\n\n===Recent developments in private banking===\nThe internationalization of the economy, technological developments such as the Internet and mobile phones ensure that banks have to innovate their [[value proposition]] and look for new [[market (economics)|market]]s. For example, the growth of HNWIs is low in traditional private banking markets like Europe, compared to Asia where the number of millionaires has grown to 3.6 million.<ref>[http://www.advisorone.com/2012/06/20/top-10-countries-with-most-millionaires-capgemini ]</ref> \n\nBanks also provide a sampling of the private banking services at a lower price point than traditional private banking. These are called premium banking or priority banking services. They are meant for mass-affluent customers. The accounts do not generate as much revenue as traditional private  banking, but given the number of customers, they amount to a sizeable revenue to the bank. The products offered to premium banking customers are the same as that for private banking customers with the exception that they do not include [[hedge fund]]s or facilities to manage one's own business accounts. In short, it is wealth management at a much smaller scale.\n\nIn 2016, Credit Suisse and UBS replaced the word \"private banking\" with wealth management; private banking has faced [[reputational risk]] as an area for [[tax avoidance]] or even [[Tax evasion|tax aversion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16rhwwt9prp4z/the-death-of-private-banking|title=The death of private banking\u2026|website=Euromoney|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Wealth minimums ===\nIn 2016, JP Morgan began requiring a minimum of $10 million in assets to qualify for their private banking, with those with less being moved into their Private Client Direct program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://advisorhub.com/jpmorgan-private-banks-10m-minimum-rattles-clients-and-bankers/|title=JPMorgan Private Bank\u2019s $10M Minimum Rattles Clients and Bankers|date=2016-03-22|website=AdvisorHub|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n== Private banking rankings ==\nResults from Euromoney's annual private banking and wealth management ranking in 2018, which consider, amongst other factors, [[assets under management]] (AUM), net income and net new assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16m2txwg1c52k/private-banking-and-wealth-management-survey-2018-results-index|title=Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2018|author=|date=|website=Euromoney}}</ref>\n\nThis table displays results of one category of the private banking ranking, \"Best global private banking services overall 2018\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16st4jyzh0rbr/euromoneys-private-banking-and-wealth-management-survey-2018-press-release|title=Euromoney's Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2018: Press release|author=|date=|website=Euromoney|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+ Best global private banking services overall 2018 \n|-\n!

Some of the dimensions of value proposition of a private bank are parent brand, one-bank approach, unbiased advice, strong research and advisory team and unified platform.\nMany banks leverage the \u201cparent brand\u201d to gain a client\u2019s trust and confidence. These banks have a strong presence across the globe and present private bank offerings as a part of the parent group. \u201cOne Bank approach\u201d is where private banks offer an integrated proposition to meet clients personal and business needs. Since private banking concerns understanding a client\u2019s need and risk appetite, and tailoring the solution accordingly, few banks define their value proposition along this dimension. Most modern private banks follow an open product platform, and hence claim their advice is unbiased. They believe there is no incentive to push proprietary products, and the client gets the best of what they offer. A few banks claim to have a \u201cstrong advisory team\u201d that reflects in the products they offer the client. A couple of banks also define their value proposition on their unified platform, their ability to comply with all regulations, yet serve the client without restrictions.\n\n== Product platform ==\n'''[[Open architecture]]''' product platform is where a private bank distributes all the third party products and is not restricted to selling only its proprietary products. '''Closed architecture''' product platform is where the bank sells only its proprietary products and does not entertain any third party product. These days the needs of the clients are so diverse that it is practically impossible for a bank to cater to those needs by its proprietary products alone. Clients today demand the best of breed products and most banks have to follow an open architecture product platform where they distribute products of other banks to their clients in return for commission. Products offered to private banking clients include equities, fixed-income securities, structured products, foreign exchange, commodities, deposits and real-estate investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/articles/private-banking|title=Private Banking|author=|date=|website=thebanks.eu|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fee structure ==\nDifferent banks charge their clients in different ways. There are banks that follow the transactional model where the client is not charged any advisory fee at all. The banks thrive totally on the commissions they get by distributing third party products. There are other private banks that follow a hybrid model. In this model, the bank charges a fixed fee for certain products and advisory fee for the rest. Some of the other banks are totally advisory driven  and charge the clients a percentage of AUM (e.g. 0.75% of entire AUM).\nA few banks offer both a transactional model and an advisory model. The clients choose what suits them. A recent industry trend is towards the advisory fee model, because margins on commissions may go down in the future.\n\n== Lead generation ==\n{{main|Lead generation}}\n'''Lead generation''' is a vital part of the private banking business. Various banks go about in different ways to acquire new clients. While some banks rely heavily on their wholesale banking referrals there are a few others that have strong tie-ups with their retail and corporate banking divisions. Most banks do have a revenue sharing mechanism in place within divisions. It is either a onetime charge to the division or an annuity that the division gets for a client referral. Many banks believe that the primary source of leads must be client referrals. A client would refer his/her friends when he/she is satisfied with the service provided by the private bank. Generating a good number of leads through client referrals shows the good health of the private bank.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*[[Public bank]]\n*[[Family office]]\n*[[Multi-family office]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.swissworld.org/en/economy/swiss_financial_centre/a_mainstay_of_the_swiss_economy/ About Swiss Financial Centre] by Swissworld.org\n* [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_37/b4194037934749.htm Businessweek: In the Battle of the Big Brokers, Merrill Is Winning]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Banking}}\n[[Category:Private banks| ]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Distribution of wealth]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Banking services for very wealthy people}}{{Banking |terms}}\n'''Private banking''' is [[bank]]ing, [[investment]] and other [[financial services]] provided by banks and financial services firms primarily to [[high-net-worth individual]]s (HNWIs) with high levels of income or sizable assets and increasingly the Mass Affluent market as well. \n\nPrivate banking forms a more exclusive (for the especially affluent) subset of [[wealth management]]. The term \"private\" refers to customer service rendered on a more personal basis than in mass-market [[retail banking]], usually via dedicated bank advisers. It does not refer to a [[private bank]], which is a non-incorporated banking institution.\n\nAt least until recently, it largely consisted of banking services (deposit taking and payments), [[Managed account|discretionary asset management]], brokerage, limited tax advisory services and some basic [[concierge]]-type services, offered by a single designated relationship manager.\n\n== Overview ==\nPrivate banking is the way banking originated. [[History of banking#Italian bankers|The first banks in Venice]] were focused on managing personal finance for wealthy families. \n\nPrivate banks came to be known as \"private\" to stand out from the retail banking and [[savings bank]]s aimed at the new [[middle class]]. Traditionally, private banks were linked to families for several generations. They often advised and performed all financial and banking services for these families. Historically, private banking has developed in Europe (see the [[Private bank#List of private banks|List of private banks]]). Some banks in Europe are known for managing the assets of some royal families. The assets of the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]] are managed by [[LGT Group]] (founded in 1920 and originally known as The Liechtenstein Global Trust). The assets of the [[Dutch royal family]] are managed by [[MeesPierson]] (founded in 1720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abnamro.com/en/about-abn-amro/history/history-downloads/index.html|title=History|author=|date=|website=www.abnamro.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> The assets of the [[British Royal Family]] are managed by [[Coutts]] (founded in 1692).\n\nHistorically, private banking has been viewed as a very exclusive niche that only caters to HNWIs with liquidity over $2 million, though it is now possible to open private banking accounts with as little as $250,000 for private investors. An institution's private banking division provides services such as wealth management, savings, inheritance, and tax planning for their clients. For private banking services, clients pay either based on the number of transactions, the annual portfolio performance or a \"flat-fee\", usually calculated as a yearly percentage of the total investment amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myprivatebanking.com/article/advice-cut-your-costs-of-wealth-management-part-2|title=Understanding Cost Drivers and Pricing Models in Wealth Management and Private Banking- MyPrivateBanking|author=|date=|website=www.myprivatebanking.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Private\" also alludes to [[bank secrecy]] and minimizing taxes through careful allocation of assets, or by hiding assets from the taxing authorities. [[Swiss bank|Swiss]] and certain [[offshore bank]]s have been criticized for such cooperation with individuals practicing tax evasion. Although ''[[tax fraud]]'' is a criminal offense in Switzerland, ''tax evasion'' is only a [[civil law (common law)|civil offence]], not requiring banks to notify taxing authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032801801.html|title=Facing Pressure Over Banking-Secrecy Tradition, Switzerland Braces for Fight|first=Craig|last=Whitlock|date=29 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Switzerland, there are many banks providing private banking services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-14/swiss-banks-buck-secrecy-squeeze-with-net-customer-inflows-of-53-billion|title=Swiss Banks Buck Secrecy Squeeze With $53 Billion of Inflows|author=|date=14 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> Switzerland has remained neutral since the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, including through two World Wars. After World War I, the former nobles of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] moved their assets to Switzerland for fear of confiscation by new governments.<ref>''The Swiss banks'' by [[T. R. Fehrenbach]]</ref> During World War II, many wealthy people, including Jewish families and institutions, moved their assets into Switzerland to protect them from Nazi Germany. However, this transfer of wealth into Switzerland had mixed and controversial results, as beneficiaries had difficulties retrieving their assets after the war.<ref>''Hitler's Secret Bankers'' by [[Adam LeBor]]</ref> After World War II, in eastern Europe, assets were again moved into Switzerland for fear of confiscation by communist governments. \n\nToday, Switzerland remains the largest offshore center, with about 27 percent ($2.0 trillion) of global offshore wealth in 2009, according to [[Boston Consulting Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/offshore_business_recovered_challenges_remain/|title=The Offshore Business Has Recovered\u2014but Challenges Remain|author=|date=|website=bcgperspectives.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Offshore wealth is defined as assets booked in a country where the investor has no legal residence or tax domicile.\n\nIn England, private banks were established in the 17th century, in parallel with the development of agriculture, managing the assets of the royal family, nobility and the landed gentry.\n\nThe United States has one of the largest private banking systems in the world, in part due to the 3.1 million HNWIs accounting for 28.6% of the global HNWIs population in 2010, according to the co-research of [[Capgemini]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. Some American banks that specialize in private banking date back to the 19th century, such as [[U.S. Trust]] (founded in 1853) and [[Northern Trust]] (founded in 1889).\n\n===Recent developments in private banking===\nThe internationalization of the economy, technological developments such as the Internet and mobile phones ensure that banks have to innovate their [[value proposition]] and look for new [[market (economics)|market]]s. For example, the growth of HNWIs is low in traditional private banking markets like Europe, compared to Asia where the number of millionaires has grown to 3.6 million.<ref>[http://www.advisorone.com/2012/06/20/top-10-countries-with-most-millionaires-capgemini ]</ref> \n\nBanks also provide a sampling of the private banking services at a lower price point than traditional private banking. These are called premium banking or priority banking services. They are meant for mass-affluent customers. The accounts do not generate as much revenue as traditional private  banking, but given the number of customers, they amount to a sizeable revenue to the bank. The products offered to premium banking customers are the same as that for private banking customers with the exception that they do not include [[hedge fund]]s or facilities to manage one's own business accounts. In short, it is wealth management at a much smaller scale.\n\nIn 2016, Credit Suisse and UBS replaced the word \"private banking\" with wealth management; private banking has faced [[reputational risk]] as an area for [[tax avoidance]] or even [[Tax evasion|tax aversion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16rhwwt9prp4z/the-death-of-private-banking|title=The death of private banking\u2026|website=Euromoney|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Wealth minimums ===\nIn 2016, JP Morgan began requiring a minimum of $10 million in assets to qualify for their private banking, with those with less being moved into their Private Client Direct program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://advisorhub.com/jpmorgan-private-banks-10m-minimum-rattles-clients-and-bankers/|title=JPMorgan Private Bank\u2019s $10M Minimum Rattles Clients and Bankers|date=2016-03-22|website=AdvisorHub|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n== Private banking rankings ==\nResults from Euromoney's annual private banking and wealth management ranking in 2018, which consider, amongst other factors, [[assets under management]] (AUM), net income and net new assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16m2txwg1c52k/private-banking-and-wealth-management-survey-2018-results-index|title=Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2018|author=|date=|website=Euromoney}}</ref>\n\nThis table displays results of one category of the private banking ranking, \"Best global private banking services overall 2018\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b16st4jyzh0rbr/euromoneys-private-banking-and-wealth-management-survey-2018-press-release|title=Euromoney's Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2018: Press release|author=|date=|website=Euromoney|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+ Best global private banking services overall 2018 \n|-\n!

Some of the dimensions of value proposition of a private bank are parent brand, one-bank approach, unbiased advice, strong research and advisory team and unified platform.\nMany banks leverage the \u201cparent brand\u201d to gain a client\u2019s trust and confidence. These banks have a strong presence across the globe and present private bank offerings as a part of the parent group. \u201cOne Bank approach\u201d is where private banks offer an integrated proposition to meet clients personal and business needs. Since private banking concerns understanding a client\u2019s need and risk appetite, and tailoring the solution accordingly, few banks define their value proposition along this dimension. Most modern private banks follow an open product platform, and hence claim their advice is unbiased. They believe there is no incentive to push proprietary products, and the client gets the best of what they offer. A few banks claim to have a \u201cstrong advisory team\u201d that reflects in the products they offer the client. A couple of banks also define their value proposition on their unified platform, their ability to comply with all regulations, yet serve the client without restrictions.\n\n== Product platform ==\n'''[[Open architecture]]''' product platform is where a private bank distributes all the third party products and is not restricted to selling only its proprietary products. '''Closed architecture''' product platform is where the bank sells only its proprietary products and does not entertain any third party product. These days the needs of the clients are so diverse that it is practically impossible for a bank to cater to those needs by its proprietary products alone. Clients today demand the best of breed products and most banks have to follow an open architecture product platform where they distribute products of other banks to their clients in return for commission. Products offered to private banking clients include equities, fixed-income securities, structured products, foreign exchange, commodities, deposits and real-estate investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/articles/private-banking|title=Private Banking|author=|date=|website=thebanks.eu|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fee structure ==\nDifferent banks charge their clients in different ways. There are banks that follow the transactional model where the client is not charged any advisory fee at all. The banks thrive totally on the commissions they get by distributing third party products. There are other private banks that follow a hybrid model. In this model, the bank charges a fixed fee for certain products and advisory fee for the rest. Some of the other banks are totally advisory driven  and charge the clients a percentage of AUM (e.g. 0.75% of entire AUM).\nA few banks offer both a transactional model and an advisory model. The clients choose what suits them. A recent industry trend is towards the advisory fee model, because margins on commissions may go down in the future.\n\n== Lead generation ==\n{{main|Lead generation}}\n'''Lead generation''' is a vital part of the private banking business. Various banks go about in different ways to acquire new clients. While some banks rely heavily on their wholesale banking referrals there are a few others that have strong tie-ups with their retail and corporate banking divisions. Most banks do have a revenue sharing mechanism in place within divisions. It is either a onetime charge to the division or an annuity that the division gets for a client referral. Many banks believe that the primary source of leads must be client referrals. A client would refer his/her friends when he/she is satisfied with the service provided by the private bank. Generating a good number of leads through client referrals shows the good health of the private bank.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*[[Public bank]]\n*[[Family office]]\n*[[Multi-family office]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.swissworld.org/en/economy/swiss_financial_centre/a_mainstay_of_the_swiss_economy/ About Swiss Financial Centre] by Swissworld.org\n* [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_37/b4194037934749.htm Businessweek: In the Battle of the Big Brokers, Merrill Is Winning]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Banking}}\n[[Category:Private banks| ]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Distribution of wealth]]\n", "name_user": "Philcroix91", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:add Private banks in Florence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_banking"}
