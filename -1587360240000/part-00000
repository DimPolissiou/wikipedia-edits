Throughout Islamic history, slaves served in various social and economic roles, from powerful [[emir]]s to harshly treated manual laborers.

In the early 20th century (post-[[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.<ref name=\"eois\">Brunschvig.

It is also practiced in countries like [[Slavery in Libya|in Libya]] and Mauritania despite being outlawed.\n\n==Slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia==\nSlavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were [[Demographics of Europe|European]] and [[People of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.<ref name=\"eois\"/> The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.<ref name=autogenerated4>Lewis (1992) p. 4</ref> Whether enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families was common is disputed.  (Abd Brunschvig argues it was rare,<ref name=\"eois\"/> but according to Jonathan E. Brockopp debt slavery was persistent.<ref name=\"Brockopp\">[[Encyclopedia of the Bible]], ''Slaves and Slavery''</ref>) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nTwo classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter, the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.<ref name=\"eois\"/><ref>Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54\u201358\n</ref><ref name=\"Esposito\">John L Esposito (1998) p. 79</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bilal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bilal ibn Ribah]] (''pictured'', atop the [[Masjid Nabawi]]) was an Ethiopian slave, emancipated on Muhammad's instruction, and appointed by him to be the first official [[muezzin]].]]\n\nThe historical accounts{{which|date=December 2016}} of the early years of Islam report that \"slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments.

He writes that\n\n# Liberation by freemen of their own offspring born by slave mothers was \"the primary drain\". \n# Liberation of slaves as an act of piety, was a contributing factor.  Other factors include:\n# [[Castration]]: A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as [[eunuch]]s. Levy states that according to the Quran and Islamic traditions, such emasculation was objectionable. Some jurists such as al-Baydawi considered castration to be mutilation, stipulating law enforcement to prevent it. However, in practice, emasculation was frequent.<ref name=\"L77\">Levy (1957) p. 77</ref> In eighteenth-century Mecca, the majority of eunuchs were in the service of the mosques.<ref>Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 16.</ref>  Moreover, the process of castration (which included [[penectomy]]) carried a high risk of death.\n# Liberation of military slaves: Military slaves that rose through the ranks were usually liberated at some stage in their careers.\n# Restrictions on procreation: Among the menial, domestic, and manual worker slaves, casual sex was not permitted and marriage was not encouraged.\n# High death toll: There was a high death toll among all classes of slaves. Slaves usually came from remote places and, lacking immunities, died in large numbers. Segal notes that recent slaves, weakened by their initial captivity and debilitating journey, would have been easy victim to climate changes and infection.<ref name=RSIBS2001:62>[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.62</ref> Children were especially at risk, and the Islamic market demand for children was much greater than the American one.

Due to fears of a similar uprising among slave gangs occurring elsewhere, Muslims came to realize that large concentrations of slaves were not a suitable organization of labour and that slaves were best employed in smaller concentrations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15140.html|author=William D.

One supply of slaves was the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]] which often exported [[Nilotic]] slaves from their western borderland provinces, or from newly conquered or reconquered Muslim provinces.

The vast majority of labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. The only known exceptions to this general rule was in the [[plantation economy]] of 9th-century [[southern Iraq]] (which led to the [[Zanj Revolt]]), in 9th-century [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]]), and in 11th-century [[Bahrain]] (during the [[Qarmatians|Karmatian]] state).<ref name=Phillips>{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D.

Moreover, the need for agricultural labor, in an Islamic world with large peasant populations, was nowhere near as acute as in the Americas.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4>[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.4</ref> Slaves in Islam were mainly directed at the service sector{{snd}} concubines and cooks, porters and soldiers{{snd}} with slavery itself primarily a form of consumption rather than a factor of production.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4/> The most telling evidence for this is found in the gender ratio; among black slaves traded in Islamic empire across the centuries, there were roughly two females to every male.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4/>\nAlmost all of these female slaves had domestic occupations.

This was a lawful motive for their purchase, and the most common one.<ref name=autogenerated1>Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 13.</ref>\n\nMilitary service was also a common role for slaves. Barbarians from the \"martial races\" beyond the frontiers were widely recruited into the imperial armies. These recruits often advanced in the imperial and eventually metropolitan forces, sometimes obtaining high ranks.<ref>Lewis 1990, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Women and slavery==\n[[File:A_slave_market_in_Cairo-David_Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A slave market in Cairo. Drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], circa 1848.]]\nIn Classical Arabic terminology, female slaves were generally called ''jaw\u0101ri'' ({{lang-ar|\u062c\u064e\u0648\u0627\u0631}}, s. ''j\u0101riya'' {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0629}}). Slave-girls specifically might be called ''im\u0101\u2019'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0650\u0645\u0627\u0621}}, s. ''ama'' {{lang-ar|\u0627\u064e\u0645\u0629}}), while female slaves who had been trained as entertainers or courtesans were usually called ''qiy\u0101n'' ({{lang-ar|\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0627\u0646}}, IPA /qi'ja\u02d0n/; singular ''qayna'', {{lang-ar|\u0642\u064e\u064a\u0646\u0629}}, IPA /'qaina/).<ref>Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiy\u0101n' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I.

There are many attributes and skills slaves can possess to win the favour and trust of their masters. When examining master/slave relationships we are able to understand that slaves with white skin were especially valued in Islamic societies.  Additionally, mode of acquisition, as well as age when acquired heavily influenced slave value as well as, could foster trusting master-slave relationships. Many times slaves acquired as adolescents or even young adults became trusted aides and confidants of their masters.  Furthermore, acquiring a slave during adolescence typically leads to opportunities for education and training, as slaves acquired in their adolescent years were at an ideal age to begin military training.  In Islamic societies it was normal to begin this process at the age of ten, lasting until the age of fifteen, at which point these young men would be considered ready for military service.  Slaves with specialised skills were highly valued in Islamic slave societies.  Christian slaves were often required to speak and write in Arabic. Having slaves fluent in English and [[Arabic]] was a highly valued tool for diplomatic affairs. [[Bi-lingual]] slaves like [[Thomas Pellow]] used their translating ability for important manners of diplomacy.  Pellow himself worked as a translator for the ambassador in [[Morocco]].\n\n===Rebellion===\nIn some cases, slaves joined to rebels or even uprose against governors. The most renowned of these rebellions was the [[Zanj Rebellion]].\n\nThe Zanj Revolt took place near the city of [[Basra]], located in southern [[Iraq]] over a period of fifteen years (869\u2013883&nbsp;AD).

The slave trade was centered on the Muslim Sultanates in the [[Sulu Sea]]: the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], and the [[Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao]] (the modern [[Moro people]]). The economies of these sultanates relied heavily on the slave trade.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n \n[[File:Iranun lanong warship by Rafael Monle\u00f3n (1890).jpg|left|250px|thumb|An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] ''[[lanong]]'' warship used for piracy and slave raids in the [[Sulu Sea]].]]\nIt is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] slavers. These were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the [[Malacca Strait]], [[Java]], the southern coast of [[China]] and the islands beyond the [[Makassar Strait]]. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and \"Malays\" (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives who were usually ransomed off through [[Tausug people|Tausug]] intermediaries of the [[Sulu Sultanate]].<ref name=\"warren2\"/> \n\n[[File:Iranun pirate.png|thumb|upright|An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] pirate armed with a spear, a ''[[kampilan]]'' sword, and a ''[[kris]]'' dagger.]]\nThe scale was so massive that the word for \"pirate\" in [[Malay language|Malay]] became ''Lanun'', an [[exonym]] of the Iranun people.  Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as [[galley slave]]s on the ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in [[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]] usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug ''[[datu]]'' from the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (''renegados'').<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nThe economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui [[slave market]]s. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nChattel slaves (known as ''banyaga'', ''bisaya'', ''ipun'', or ''ammas'') were distinguished from the traditional debt bondsmen (the ''kiapangdilihan'', known as ''[[alipin]]'' elsewhere in the Philippines). The bondsmen were natives enslaved to pay for debt or crime. They were slaves only in terms of their temporary service requirement to their master, but retained most of the rights of the freemen, including protection from physical harm and the fact that they can not be sold. The ''banyaga'' on the other hand had little to no rights.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nMost slaves were treated like serfs and servants. Educated and skilled slaves were largely treated well. Since most of the aristocratic classes in Sulu were illiterate, they were often dependent on the educated ''banyaga'' as scribes and interpreters. Slaves part of the labor force were often given their own houses and lived in small communities with slaves of similar ethnic and religious backgrounds. However harsh punishment and abuse was not uncommon despite Islamic laws, especially for slave laborers and slaves who attempt to escape.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>  \n[[File:Bombardment Balanguingui.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Spanish expedition to Balanguingui|Spanish warships bombarding]] Moro pirates in [[Balanguingui Island]] in 1848]]\nSpanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in [[Manila City|Manila]], [[Cavite City|Cavite]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and [[Iligan City|Iligan]]. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the [[Visayas Islands]], including the construction of war \"''barangayanes''\" (''[[balangay]]'') that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, ''[[Lanong]]'' warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired [[steamship|steam gunboat]]s (''vapor''), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.<ref name=\"warren\">{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =The Sulu Zone, 1768\u20131898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State|publisher =NUS Press|year =2007|pages=257&ndash;258|isbn =9789971693862}}</ref><ref name=\"non\"/><ref name=\"barrows\">{{cite book|author=David P.

While this was temporarily offset by the economic prosperity brought by the slave trade, the decline of slavery in the mid-19th century also led to the economic decline of the Sultanates of [[Sultanate of Brunei|Brunei]], Sulu, and Maguindanao. This eventually led to the collapse of the latter two states and contributed to the widespread poverty of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Moro region]] in the [[Philippines]] today. By the 1850s, most slaves were local-born from slave parents as the raiding became more difficult. By the end of the 19th century and the conquest of the Sultanates by the Spanish and the Americans, the slave population were largely integrated into the native population as citizens under the Philippine government.<ref name=\"warren\"/><ref name=\"warren2\"/><ref name=\"non\">{{cite journal|author=Domingo M.

They purchased slaves (as well as opium and Bengali cloth) from the Sulu Sea sultanates then sold them in the [[slave market]]s in the rest of Southeast Asia. Several hundred slaves (mostly Christian Filipinos) were sold by the Bugis annually in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Malacca]], [[Banten (town)|Bantam]], [[Chirebon]], [[Banjarmasin]], and [[Palembang]] by the Bugis. The slaves were usually sold to Dutch and Chinese families as servants, sailors, laborers, and concubines. The sale of Christian Filipinos (who were Spanish subjects) in Dutch-controlled cities led to formal protests by the Spanish Empire to the Netherlands and its prohibition in 1762 by the Dutch, but it had little effect due to lax or absent enforcement. The Bugis slave trade was only stopped in the 1860s when the Spanish navy from Manila started patrolling Sulu waters to intercept Bugis slave ships and rescue Filipino captives. Also contributing to the decline was the hostility of the [[Sama-Bajau people|Sama-Bajau]] raiders in [[Tawi-Tawi]] who broke off their allegiance to the Sultanate of Sulu in the mid-1800s and started attacking ships trading with the Tausug ports.<ref name=\"warren2\">{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53&ndash;56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Singapore]] as late as 1891, there was a regular trade in Chinese slaves by Muslim slaveowners, with girls and women sold for concubinage.<ref>[[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]], ''Verspreide Geschriften'' (Bonn, 1923), II, II ff</ref>\n\n==19th and 20th centuries==\n{{See also|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)#Sudanese slaves in Egypt}}\n[[Image:Hamoud bin Mohammed2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hamoud bin Mohammed, Sultan of Zanzibar from 1896 to 1902 was decorated by [[Queen Victoria]] for complying with British demands that slavery be banned and slaves be freed.]]\nThe strong abolitionist movement in the 19th century in England and later in other [[Western world|Western countries]] influenced slavery in Muslim lands.

The \"catch\" of these abolitions was that slave ''ownership'' was not abolished. The edict \"recognized the rights of owners by stipulating that they should be compensated for their loss of property\". No financial payment was provided by the state, so that the abolition amounted to \"little more than propaganda for foreign consumption\". Religious authorities within Mauritania assailed abolition. One leader, El Hassan Ould Benyamine, imam of a mosque in Tayarat attacked it as <blockquote>\"not only illegal because it is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran. The abolition also amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their goods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.`<ref name=\"RSIBS2001:206\"/><ref>\"God created Me to Be a Slave,\" ''New York Times Magazine'', October 12, 1997, p. 58</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1994\u201395, a Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights documented the physical and emotional abuse of captives by the Sudanese Army and allied militia and army. The captives were \"sold as slaves or forced to work under conditions amounting to slavery\". The Sudanese government responded with \"fury\", accusing the author, Gaspar Biro of \"harboring anti-Islam and Anti-Arab sentiments\".

In the early 20th century (post-[[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.<ref name=\"eois\">Brunschvig.

It is also practiced in countries like [[Slavery in Libya|in Libya]] and Mauritania despite being outlawed.\n\n==Slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia==\nSlavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were [[Demographics of Europe|European]] and [[People of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.<ref name=\"eois\"/> The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.<ref name=autogenerated4>Lewis (1992) p. 4</ref> Whether enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families was common is disputed.  (Abd Brunschvig argues it was rare,<ref name=\"eois\"/> but according to Jonathan E. Brockopp debt slavery was persistent.<ref name=\"Brockopp\">[[Encyclopedia of the Bible]], ''Slaves and Slavery''</ref>) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nTwo classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter, the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.<ref name=\"eois\"/><ref>Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54\u201358\n</ref><ref name=\"Esposito\">John L Esposito (1998) p. 79</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bilal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bilal ibn Ribah]] (''pictured'', atop the [[Masjid Nabawi]]) was an Ethiopian slave, emancipated on Muhammad's instruction, and appointed by him to be the first official [[muezzin]].]]\n\nThe historical accounts{{which|date=December 2016}} of the early years of Islam report that \"slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments.

He writes that\n\n# Liberation by freemen of their own offspring born by slave mothers was \"the primary drain\". \n# Liberation of slaves as an act of piety, was a contributing factor.  Other factors include:\n# [[Castration]]: A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as [[eunuch]]s. Levy states that according to the Quran and Islamic traditions, such emasculation was objectionable. Some jurists such as al-Baydawi considered castration to be mutilation, stipulating law enforcement to prevent it. However, in practice, emasculation was frequent.<ref name=\"L77\">Levy (1957) p. 77</ref> In eighteenth-century Mecca, the majority of eunuchs were in the service of the mosques.<ref>Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 16.</ref>  Moreover, the process of castration (which included [[penectomy]]) carried a high risk of death.\n# Liberation of military slaves: Military slaves that rose through the ranks were usually liberated at some stage in their careers.\n# Restrictions on procreation: Among the menial, domestic, and manual worker slaves, casual sex was not permitted and marriage was not encouraged.\n# High death toll: There was a high death toll among all classes of slaves. Slaves usually came from remote places and, lacking immunities, died in large numbers. Segal notes that recent slaves, weakened by their initial captivity and debilitating journey, would have been easy victim to climate changes and infection.<ref name=RSIBS2001:62>[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.62</ref> Children were especially at risk, and the Islamic market demand for children was much greater than the American one.

One supply of slaves was the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]] which often exported [[Nilotic]] slaves from their western borderland provinces, or from newly conquered or reconquered Muslim provinces. Native Muslim Ethiopian [[sultanates]] (rulership) exported slaves as well, such as the sometimes independent sultanate (rulership) of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]].<ref>Pankhurst (1997) p. 59</ref>\n\nFor a long time, until the early 18th century, the [[Crimean Khanate]] maintained a massive slave trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Middle East.

The vast majority of labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. The only known exceptions to this general rule was in the [[plantation economy]] of 9th-century [[southern Iraq]] (which led to the [[Zanj Revolt]]), in 9th-century [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]]), and in 11th-century [[Bahrain]] (during the [[Qarmatians|Karmatian]] state).<ref name=Phillips>{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D.

Moreover, the need for agricultural labor, in an Islamic world with large peasant populations, was nowhere near as acute as in the Americas.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4>[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.4</ref> Slaves in Islam were mainly directed at the service sector{{snd}} concubines and cooks, porters and soldiers{{snd}} with slavery itself primarily a form of consumption rather than a factor of production.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4/> The most telling evidence for this is found in the gender ratio; among black slaves traded in Islamic empire across the centuries, there were roughly two females to every male.<ref name=RSIBS2001:4/>\nAlmost all of these female slaves had domestic occupations.

This was a lawful motive for their purchase, and the most common one.<ref name=autogenerated1>Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 13.</ref>\n\nMilitary service was also a common role for slaves. Barbarians from the \"martial races\" beyond the frontiers were widely recruited into the imperial armies. These recruits often advanced in the imperial and eventually metropolitan forces, sometimes obtaining high ranks.<ref>Lewis 1990, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Women and slavery==\n[[File:A_slave_market_in_Cairo-David_Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A slave market in Cairo. Drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], circa 1848.]]\nIn Classical Arabic terminology, female slaves were generally called ''jaw\u0101ri'' ({{lang-ar|\u062c\u064e\u0648\u0627\u0631}}, s. ''j\u0101riya'' {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0629}}). Slave-girls specifically might be called ''im\u0101\u2019'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0650\u0645\u0627\u0621}}, s. ''ama'' {{lang-ar|\u0627\u064e\u0645\u0629}}), while female slaves who had been trained as entertainers or courtesans were usually called ''qiy\u0101n'' ({{lang-ar|\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0627\u0646}}, IPA /qi'ja\u02d0n/; singular ''qayna'', {{lang-ar|\u0642\u064e\u064a\u0646\u0629}}, IPA /'qaina/).<ref>Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiy\u0101n' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), pp. ix-x, 1\u20132.</ref> They included sometimes highly trained entertainers known as ''[[qiyan]] who'' enjoyed special privileges and status.\n\n==Choosing elite slaves for the grooming process==\nChoosing slaves to undergo the grooming process was highly selective in the Moroccan empire. There are many attributes and skills slaves can possess to win the favour and trust of their masters. When examining master/slave relationships we are able to understand that slaves with white skin were especially valued in Islamic societies.  Additionally, mode of acquisition, as well as age when acquired heavily influenced slave value as well as, could foster trusting master-slave relationships. Many times slaves acquired as adolescents or even young adults became trusted aides and confidants of their masters.  Furthermore, acquiring a slave during adolescence typically leads to opportunities for education and training, as slaves acquired in their adolescent years were at an ideal age to begin military training.  In Islamic societies it was normal to begin this process at the age of ten, lasting until the age of fifteen, at which point these young men would be considered ready for military service.  Slaves with specialised skills were highly valued in Islamic slave societies.  Christian slaves were often required to speak and write in Arabic. Having slaves fluent in English and [[Arabic]] was a highly valued tool for diplomatic affairs. [[Bi-lingual]] slaves like [[Thomas Pellow]] used their translating ability for important manners of diplomacy.

The slave trade was centered on the Muslim Sultanates in the [[Sulu Sea]]: the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], and the [[Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao]] (the modern [[Moro people]]). The economies of these sultanates relied heavily on the slave trade.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n \n[[File:Iranun lanong warship by Rafael Monle\u00f3n (1890).jpg|left|250px|thumb|An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] ''[[lanong]]'' warship used for piracy and slave raids in the [[Sulu Sea]].]]\nIt is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] slavers. These were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the [[Malacca Strait]], [[Java]], the southern coast of [[China]] and the islands beyond the [[Makassar Strait]]. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and \"Malays\" (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives who were usually ransomed off through [[Tausug people|Tausug]] intermediaries of the [[Sulu Sultanate]].<ref name=\"warren2\"/> \n\n[[File:Iranun pirate.png|thumb|upright|An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] pirate armed with a spear, a ''[[kampilan]]'' sword, and a ''[[kris]]'' dagger.]]\nThe scale was so massive that the word for \"pirate\" in [[Malay language|Malay]] became ''Lanun'', an [[exonym]] of the Iranun people.  Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as [[galley slave]]s on the ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in [[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]] usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug ''[[datu]]'' from the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (''renegados'').<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nThe economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui [[slave market]]s. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nChattel slaves (known as ''banyaga'', ''bisaya'', ''ipun'', or ''ammas'') were distinguished from the traditional debt bondsmen (the ''kiapangdilihan'', known as ''[[alipin]]'' elsewhere in the Philippines). The bondsmen were natives enslaved to pay for debt or crime. They were slaves only in terms of their temporary service requirement to their master, but retained most of the rights of the freemen, including protection from physical harm and the fact that they can not be sold. The ''banyaga'' on the other hand had little to no rights.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>\n\nMost slaves were treated like serfs and servants. Educated and skilled slaves were largely treated well. Since most of the aristocratic classes in Sulu were illiterate, they were often dependent on the educated ''banyaga'' as scribes and interpreters. Slaves part of the labor force were often given their own houses and lived in small communities with slaves of similar ethnic and religious backgrounds. However harsh punishment and abuse was not uncommon despite Islamic laws, especially for slave laborers and slaves who attempt to escape.<ref name=\"warren2\"/>  \n[[File:Bombardment Balanguingui.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Spanish expedition to Balanguingui|Spanish warships bombarding]] Moro pirates in [[Balanguingui Island]] in 1848]]\nSpanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in [[Manila City|Manila]], [[Cavite City|Cavite]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and [[Iligan City|Iligan]]. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the [[Visayas Islands]], including the construction of war \"''barangayanes''\" (''[[balangay]]'') that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, ''[[Lanong]]'' warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired [[steamship|steam gunboat]]s (''vapor''), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.<ref name=\"warren\">{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =The Sulu Zone, 1768\u20131898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State|publisher =NUS Press|year =2007|pages=257&ndash;258|isbn =9789971693862}}</ref><ref name=\"non\"/><ref name=\"barrows\">{{cite book|author=David P.

While this was temporarily offset by the economic prosperity brought by the slave trade, the decline of slavery in the mid-19th century also led to the economic decline of the Sultanates of [[Sultanate of Brunei|Brunei]], Sulu, and Maguindanao. This eventually led to the collapse of the latter two states and contributed to the widespread poverty of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Moro region]] in the [[Philippines]] today. By the 1850s, most slaves were local-born from slave parents as the raiding became more difficult. By the end of the 19th century and the conquest of the Sultanates by the Spanish and the Americans, the slave population were largely integrated into the native population as citizens under the Philippine government.<ref name=\"warren\"/><ref name=\"warren2\"/><ref name=\"non\">{{cite journal|author=Domingo M.

They purchased slaves (as well as opium and Bengali cloth) from the Sulu Sea sultanates then sold them in the [[slave market]]s in the rest of Southeast Asia. Several hundred slaves (mostly Christian Filipinos) were sold by the Bugis annually in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Malacca]], [[Banten (town)|Bantam]], [[Chirebon]], [[Banjarmasin]], and [[Palembang]] by the Bugis. The slaves were usually sold to Dutch and Chinese families as servants, sailors, laborers, and concubines. The sale of Christian Filipinos (who were Spanish subjects) in Dutch-controlled cities led to formal protests by the Spanish Empire to the Netherlands and its prohibition in 1762 by the Dutch, but it had little effect due to lax or absent enforcement. The Bugis slave trade was only stopped in the 1860s when the Spanish navy from Manila started patrolling Sulu waters to intercept Bugis slave ships and rescue Filipino captives. Also contributing to the decline was the hostility of the [[Sama-Bajau people|Sama-Bajau]] raiders in [[Tawi-Tawi]] who broke off their allegiance to the Sultanate of Sulu in the mid-1800s and started attacking ships trading with the Tausug ports.<ref name=\"warren2\">{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53&ndash;56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Singapore]] as late as 1891, there was a regular trade in Chinese slaves by Muslim slaveowners, with girls and women sold for concubinage.<ref>[[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]], ''Verspreide Geschriften'' (Bonn, 1923), II, II ff</ref>\n\n==19th and 20th centuries==\n{{See also|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)#Sudanese slaves in Egypt}}\n[[Image:Hamoud bin Mohammed2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hamoud bin Mohammed, Sultan of Zanzibar from 1896 to 1902 was decorated by [[Queen Victoria]] for complying with British demands that slavery be banned and slaves be freed.]]\nThe strong abolitionist movement in the 19th century in England and later in other [[Western world|Western countries]] influenced slavery in Muslim lands.

The \"catch\" of these abolitions was that slave ''ownership'' was not abolished. The edict \"recognized the rights of owners by stipulating that they should be compensated for their loss of property\". No financial payment was provided by the state, so that the abolition amounted to \"little more than propaganda for foreign consumption\". Religious authorities within Mauritania assailed abolition. One leader, El Hassan Ould Benyamine, imam of a mosque in Tayarat attacked it as <blockquote>\"not only illegal because it is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran. The abolition also amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their goods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.`<ref name=\"RSIBS2001:206\"/><ref>\"God created Me to Be a Slave,\" ''New York Times Magazine'', October 12, 1997, p. 58</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1994\u201395, a Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights documented the physical and emotional abuse of captives by the Sudanese Army and allied militia and army. The captives were \"sold as slaves or forced to work under conditions amounting to slavery\". The Sudanese government responded with \"fury\", accusing the author, Gaspar Biro of \"harboring anti-Islam and Anti-Arab sentiments\".

The shrine is directed by The [[Barnabite| Barnabite Fathers]].

They sought to support the Barnabite Fathers, a missionary order working the area.  The group set out to create a shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nFirst among the many Shrine benefactors were Mr. & Mrs. Walter Ciurzak who, in 1954, donated {{convert|16|acre|m2}} of their farmland for the construction of the Shrine.  \nin Lewiston.  At that time, the shrine began with just one humble statue of Our Lady of Fatima. Later, in 1960, the shrine that exists today was founded.<ref name=\"Donor\">[http://www.fatimashrine.com/ Official Web Site]</ref>\n\nThe church was started in 1963 and dedicated in 1965.\n\nOn October 7, 1975 [[Paul VI|Pope Paul VI]] conferred the title of [[Basilica]] upon the church.  Thousands of [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] from around the country and the world visit the basilica each year.\n\n==Notable Features==\n\nThe basilica is located on 16 acres of land. The Basilica is highlighted by a magnificent dome that measures {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} high.

They sought to support the Barnabite Fathers, a missionary order working the area.  The group set out to create a shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nFirst among the many Shrine benefactors were Mr. & Mrs. Walter Ciurzak who, in 1954, donated {{convert|16|acre|m2}} of their farmland for the construction of the Shrine.  \nin Lewiston.  At that time, the shrine began with just one humble statue of Our Lady of Fatima. Later, in 1960, the shrine that exists today was founded.<ref name=\"Donor\">[http://www.fatimashrine.com/ Official Web Site]</ref>\n\nThe church was started in 1963 and dedicated in 1965.\n\nOn October 7, 1975 [[Paul VI|Pope Paul VI]] conferred the title of [[Basilica]] upon the church.  Thousands of [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] from around the country and the world visit the basilica each year.\n\n==Notable Features==\n\nThe basilica is located on 16 acres of land.

That year, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, and was second in the NBA in [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the [[three-point field goal|3-point]] line.

The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kuko\u010d, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.\n\nHowever, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season. [[Jerry Krause]], the Bulls' general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen off to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in exchange for all-star forward [[Shawn Kemp]], moving [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] into Pippen's position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the vacant starting power forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] during the off-season.  In January, when asked by the late [[Craig Sager]] as to whether he thought that he would be traded, Pippen replied, \"I hope I am\".<ref name=\"bulls_1995\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLFqk2JZEhM|title=Scottie Pippen Hopes to Be Traded to Suns (1995)|work=youtube.com|publisher=NBA TV|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls, late in the {{nbay|1994}} season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the {{nbay|1994}} season as they had in the season before. In fact, for the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure).

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 [[three-point field goal|three-pointers]] in his career.\n\nSeveral NBA players, including [[Jason Kidd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html|title=Jason Kidd Would Take Scottie Pippen Over LeBron James in His All-Time Starting Five|first=Brian|last=Josephs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=Jun 15, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Michael Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1849417-michael-jordan-dishes-on-his-starting-5-favorite-shoes-dunks-more|title=Michael Jordan Dishes on His Starting 5, Favorite Shoes, Dunks and More|first=Kenny|last=Dorset|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Nov 13, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and [[Karl Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1662152-karl-malone-leaves-mj-off-his-all-time-starting-5-admits-man-crush-on-lebron|title=Karl Malone Leaves MJ Off His All-Time Starting 5, Admits 'Man Crush' on LeBron|first=Zack|last=Buckley|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Jun 4, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Scottie Pippen and his wife on December 15, 2006.jpg|300x300px|thumbnail|left|Pippen and his wife Larsa attending a [[Chicago Bulls]] game in December 2006]]\nAlthough his given name is spelled ''Scotty'' on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by ''Scottie''.<ref name=smith_07301996/> He stated that people usually shorten the name to ''Scott'' if it ends in ''y''.<ref name=fussman_12162011/>\n\nPippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom he has a son, Antron Pippen (born 1987),<ref name=\"SunTimes89\">{{cite news|title=Scottie Pippen|date=May 29, 1989|first=Lacy J.|last=Banks|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=11}}</ref> and to Larsa Younan (married 1997; divorced 2018), with whom he has four children, Scotty Pippen Jr. (born 2000), Preston Pippen (born 2002), Justin Pippen (born 2005), and Sophia Pippen (born 2008).

In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season.

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 [[three-point field goal|three-pointers]] in his career.\n\nSeveral NBA players, including [[Jason Kidd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html|title=Jason Kidd Would Take Scottie Pippen Over LeBron James in His All-Time Starting Five|first=Brian|last=Josephs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=Jun 15, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Michael Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1849417-michael-jordan-dishes-on-his-starting-5-favorite-shoes-dunks-more|title=Michael Jordan Dishes on His Starting 5, Favorite Shoes, Dunks and More|first=Kenny|last=Dorset|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Nov 13, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and [[Karl Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1662152-karl-malone-leaves-mj-off-his-all-time-starting-5-admits-man-crush-on-lebron|title=Karl Malone Leaves MJ Off His All-Time Starting 5, Admits 'Man Crush' on LeBron|first=Zack|last=Buckley|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Jun 4, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Scottie Pippen and his wife on December 15, 2006.jpg|300x300px|thumbnail|left|Pippen and his wife Larsa attending a [[Chicago Bulls]] game in December 2006]]\nAlthough his given name is spelled ''Scotty'' on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by ''Scottie''.<ref name=smith_07301996/> He stated that people usually shorten the name to ''Scott'' if it ends in ''y''.<ref name=fussman_12162011/>\n\nPippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom he has a son, Antron Pippen (born 1987),<ref name=\"SunTimes89\">{{cite news|title=Scottie Pippen|date=May 29, 1989|first=Lacy J.|last=Banks|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=11}}</ref> and to Larsa Younan (married 1997; divorced 2018), with whom he has four children, Scotty Pippen Jr. (born 2000), Preston Pippen (born 2002), Justin Pippen (born 2005), and Sophia Pippen (born 2008).

Regular season games were played in the [[Riot Games]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n== Format ==\nTeams compete in a double round robin tournament over the course of nine weeks during the regular season, with matches being best-of-three. The top six teams from the regular season advanced to the playoff stage, with the top two teams receiving a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] to the semifinals. The seventh place team qualifies for the next split of the LCS but does not participate in playoffs. The bottom three teams play in a promotion/relegation tournament against the top two [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]] teams. Playoffs were single-elimination and matches were best-of-five. The winner of the summer split automatically qualified for the [[2016 League of Legends World Championship|2016 World Championship]], while the team with the most cumulative championship points from the spring and summer splits also qualified for World Championship. A final team, the winner of the regional finals, also qualified for the World Championship.\n\n== Spring ==\n\n=== Offseason changes ===\nAs the team with the worst record in the [[2015 NA LCS season#Summer|2015 NA LCS Summer regular season]], [[Team Dragon Knights]] was automatically relegated to the [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]]. As the eighth and ninth team places respectively, [[Team 8 (esports)|Team 8]] and [[Enemy (esports)|Enemy eSports]] were obligated to play in a promotion tournament against the second and third place Challenger teams, who were [[Team Coast]] and [[Team Imagine]] respectively. Enemy was relegated after losing to Coast 3\u20130, but Team 8 beat Imagine 3\u20131 to remain in the LCS. The two teams that won the Promotion matches both sold their spots to other teams before the start of the spring split. The [[LA Renegades]] were automatically promoted by winning the [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]].\n\nA total of three, Team Coast, Team 8, and [[Gravity Gaming]] sold their spots, all to new esports organizations that had been created for the sole purpose of being in the LCS.

Regular season games were played in the [[Riot Games]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n== Format ==\nTeams compete in a double round robin tournament over the course of nine weeks during the regular season, with matches being best-of-three. The top six teams from the regular season advanced to the playoff stage, with the top two teams receiving a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] to the semifinals. The seventh place team qualifies for the next split of the LCS but does not participate in playoffs. The bottom three teams play in a promotion/relegation tournament against the top two [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]] teams. Playoffs were single-elimination and matches were best-of-five. The winner of the summer split automatically qualified for the [[2016 League of Legends World Championship|2016 World Championship]], while the team with the most cumulative championship points from the spring and summer splits also qualified for World Championship. A final team, the winner of the regional finals, also qualified for the World Championship.\n\n== Spring ==\n\n=== Offseason changes ===\nAs the team with the worst record in the [[2015 NA LCS season#Summer|2015 NA LCS Summer regular season]], [[Team Dragon Knights]] was automatically relegated to the [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]]. As the eighth and ninth team places respectively, [[Team 8 (esports)|Team 8]] and [[Enemy (esports)|Enemy eSports]] were obligated to play in a promotion tournament against the second and third place Challenger teams, who were [[Team Coast]] and [[Team Imagine]] respectively. Enemy was relegated after losing to Coast 3\u20130, but Team 8 beat Imagine 3\u20131 to remain in the LCS. The two teams that won the Promotion matches both sold their spots to other teams before the start of the spring split. The [[LA Renegades]] were automatically promoted by winning the [[League of Legends Challenger Series|NA Challenger Series]].\n\nA total of three, Team Coast, Team 8, and [[Gravity Gaming]] sold their spots, all to new esports organizations that had been created for the sole purpose of being in the LCS.
