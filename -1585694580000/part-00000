Prior to 2003, only cave tours were available until a major expansion took place. The park is unique because it sits at an altitude of 7,100 feet on a mountain above Glenwood. Today, the park features numerous attractions in addition to the cave tours.\n\n==History==\n'''<big>Discovery</big>'''\n\nIn the late 1800s, Charles W. Darrow discovered a cave system on Iron Mountain after hearing the mountain \"whistle\". The source was the cave mouth, and in 1895 Darrow opened the caves to the public. Methods of getting to the caves included horseback and walking. In 1897, Darrow was able to bring electric lights to the cave with the help of the city's [[hydro-electric]] plant, becoming one of the first caves to do so. In the same year, a tunnel was blasted out to [[Glenwood Canyon]] with an observation deck named Exclamation Point. With the onset of [[World War I]], the caves were closed to the public in 1917.\n\n'''<big>New ownership</big>'''\n\nIn 1999, Steve and Jeanne Beckley, who own the land the cave is on, reopened the cave to public after restoration work. The caverns were accessed by bus, using a small building next to the Hotel Colorado as a base. In 2002, the Beckleys gained approval to build a massive expansion. The centerpiece would be a pulse gondola built by [[Leitner-Poma|Poma]] and a visitor center at the top of the mountain that included a restaurant. The tramway would allow year-round access to the caverns. A large sluice box and gift shop were also available to the public. The expansion proved to be a massive success, attracting 150,000 people before the one-year anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/dream-realized-as-iron-mountain-tramway-opens/|title=Dream realized as Iron Mountain Tramway opens {{!}} PostIndependent.com|website=www.postindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/tram-gives-caverns-attendance-a-lift/|title=Tram gives caverns attendance a lift {{!}} PostIndependent.com|website=www.postindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/contest-winners-take-the-plunge/|title=Contest winners take the plunge {{!}} PostIndependent.com|website=www.postindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\n'''<big>Development into adventure park</big>'''\n\nBecause the tramway increased uphill capacity, lines for the cave tours grew. To provide patrons with something to do while waiting for the cave tours, the park added attractions. Major additions included North America's first [[Mountain coaster|alpine coaster]], a zip ride, a swing style attraction, and a climbing wall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/adventure-park-goes-beyond-caverns/|title=Adventure park goes beyond caverns {{!}} PostIndependent.com|website=www.postindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref> All attractions opened for the summer season in May 2005. Many of the attractions were named by locals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.postindependent.com/news/contest-winners-take-the-plunge/|title=Contest winners take the plunge {{!}} PostIndependent.com|website=www.postindependent.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref> In order to satisfy the increased demand, each pulse on the gondola received another cabin as well. From 2005 to 2010, various attractions were added, such as a [[4D film|4-D theater]], the first in Colorado, and other temporary features. The next major attraction came in 2010 in the form the Giant Canyon Swing, an [[S&S - Sansei Technologies|S&S Power]] [[Screamin' Swing]]. The swing has since attracted notability throughout the theme park world and has been featured on numerous television shows. About this time, the zip ride moved, sharing a joint tower structure with a bungee jump.\n\n'''<big>Further expansions</big>'''\n\n2012 saw the biggest expansion since 2005, when three new rides were brought to the park. These included a Zierer kiddie coaster and an SBF/Visa Ferris wheel, both relocated from a park in Canada. The major addition was the [[Cliffhanger (Colorado roller coaster)|Cliffhanger]] roller coaster, relocated from the closed [[Celebration City]] in [[Branson, Missouri]]. The coaster saw a grand opening in June of that year. At an elevation of 7,160' above sea level, it is the highest-elevation, full-sized roller coaster in America. In 2013, it was revealed that the park was working on an expansion of the upper part of the cave system. With this expansion, the single cave tour was split into two smaller 40-minute tours, allowing increased capacity. The tramway undertook its own expansion, adding two more pulses; this brought the total to six, with eighteen cabins in all, the maximum efficiency of the tramway. The next ride came in 2014, an SBF/Visa custom swing named Glenwood Canyon Flyer, installed as a milder alternative to the Giant Canyon Swing. It made an appearance on the show Thrill Factor in 2015 in \"Kari Has No Sense\".<ref>{{Citation|title=\"Thrill Factor\" Kari Has No Sense (TV Episode 2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4953574/?ref_=ttep_ep3|accessdate=2017-06-23}}</ref> Early 2017 brought an official announcement of the next new ride, the Haunted Mine Drop, which opened in the summer of that year. The drop tower is the first in the world to drop underground and features prominent themes in addition to the 110-foot drop. The park is also expected to receive two new \"adventure vehicles\" that will join the one the park received in 2016. The purpose of the vehicles is to provide alternate transportation up the mountain, replacing the buses that the park uses for inclement weather. These vehicles will also be used to relieve congestion of the tramway, as it has reach maximum capacity.\n\nFor 2019, the Iron Mountain Tramway was placed by the Glenwood Gondola, with 44 detachable cabins and capacity to transport 1,000 people per hour up and down the mountain. The original towers were reused, with Leitner-Poma supplying new detachable terminals and new cabins.\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Type !!

Essentially abandoned in 1917, the cave was left ungated. During this time, more rooms were discovered; however, this expansion came at a price, as vandals often took advantage of the cave. In the 1960s, Pete Prebble bought the cave from the Darrow family and sealed the cave, with the hopes of making a commercial venture of it in the future. While he never achieved this, he did explore more of the cave system, finding it to be much bigger than expected. He eventually found what became known as The Barn by squeezing through what is known as Jam Crack. Jam Crack, just 8 1/2 inches wide at its narrowest point, is the only known natural passage between the upper and lower parts of the cave. The cave is now separated into three sections, upper, middle, and lower parts. Today, around 3 miles of passageway is known to exist, although the cave is estimated to have 10 miles total. Even at three miles, the Fairy Cave (the official title of the system) is one of the largest systems in the state and a rarity among caves, as it was formed by hot springs. The cave is still being actively explored by a few cavers.\n\n'''<big>Historic Fairy Caves Tour</big>'''\n\nThe Fairy Cave Tour, a quarter-mile long, takes place in the upper section of the cave. The first half of the tour re-traces the steps of the original explorers, before going through the Darrow tunnel. This leads to Exclamation Point, looking 1,300 feet into Glenwood Canyon. The second half of the tour, opened in 2013, explores places once only accessible by the Wild Tour. Focusing on the history of the cave, including how it was named, the tour lasts 40 minutes and, because the cave is relatively small, accommodates only 20 guests per tour.\n\n'''<big>Kings Row Tour</big>'''\n\nFormally the second half of the original cave tour prior to 2013, this tour predominantly features two rooms, The Barn and Kings Row, which are in the middle section of the cave. Guests enter through the bore before entering the top of The Barn. This tour focuses more on formations and cave geology, as guests descend 127 stairs to the bottom of The Barn, at the entrance to Kings Row. Here guides will point out the many features of what is the most decorated cave room in the state. The tour features a light show, part of which highlights the cave's bio-luminescence. Guests then return slowly to the start of the tour. The tour last 40 minutes and accommodates 25 people.\n\n'''<big>Wild Cave Tours</big>'''\n\nWild Cave Tours are by reservation only, at specific times during peak hours and by appointment only during off-peak, depending on guide availability. These are not walking tours; guests participate in an actual caving experience that requires strenuous activity, including climbing and crawling, sometimes for extended periods. However, participants are rewarded with a more pristine cave, less visited rooms and smaller groups. The experience last three hours and accommodates groups of eight or fewer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.glenwoodcaverns.com Glenwood Caverns website]\n\n{{Coord|39.5605|-107.32016|format=dms|display=title|type:landmark_region:US-CO}}\n\n[[Category:Caves of Colorado]]\n[[Category:Glenwood Springs, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Garfield County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Garfield County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Show caves in the United States]]\n[[Category:Adventure parks]]\n[[Category:Amusement parks in Colorado]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox amusement park\n| name = Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park\n| image = [[File:Glenwood_Caverns_Adventure_Park_Logo_2017.png|250px]]\n| location = Glenwood Springs\n| location2 = Colorado\n| location3 = United States of America\n| coordinates = 39\u00b033\u203238\u2033N 107\u00b019\u203213\u2033W\n| homepage = http://www.glenwoodcaverns.com/\n| owner = Family Owned\n| opening_date = 1999\n| previous_names = Glenwood Caverns (1999-2002)\n| season = Year Round\n| rides = 12 (as of 2017)\n| coasters = 3\n| slogan = America's only mountain top theme park!\n}}\n\n'''Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park''' is an [[adventure park]] located above [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], about 160 miles west of [[Denver]].

There have been several types os reserach locally, ranging from the predominant study of the Geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the Geochemical, Climatic, and ecosistemic reserach to set the different changes that have been documented along the Formation. Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation. The Most Studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on Late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800. At the first the Formation Wasn\u00b4t identifed as a separated unit. The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the Banz Abbey. Among the oldest examples of fossils found on the formation is included the crocodrylomorph [[Steneosaurus]] on 1824, but being identified as a Gharial.<ref>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, E. (1825).

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones. The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

[[Dormettingen]] shales have been calculated biochronologically and with isochron data, giving and approximate age of 183.0 million years old, being close to the [[Pliensbachian]] boundary based on the recent revisions of the Early Jurassic Subperiods.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>The Toarcian and the Pliensbachian are considered as strongly constrained in terms of chronology, although that doesn\u00b4t imply that all the formations labelled to one of the two periods have to be limited; for example Lithuanian [[Neringa Formation]] whose upper strata matches with the lowermost Toarcian (183.0).<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/> The rich Shale of the foreland area of the Swabian and Franconian Alb have been recovered as part of the Posidonia, with samples that expose an age between 183.0 to 181.1, thus recovering the Lower Toarcian strata.

This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter.

Due to the continuous nature of running gait, no certain point is assumed to be the beginning.  However, for simplicity, it will be assumed that absorption and footstrike mark the beginning of the running cycle in a body already in motion.\n\n===Footstrike===\nFootstrike occurs when a plantar portion of the foot makes initial contact with the ground.  Common footstrike types include forefoot, midfoot and heel strike types.<ref name=\"Daoud 2012 1325\u201334\">{{cite journal|last=Daoud|first=A.I.|title=Foot Strike and Injury Rates in Endurance Runners: a retrospective study|journal= Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|year=2012|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1325\u20131334|doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3182465115|pmid=22217561|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c631ea6d9af38687347516d10748825a2c4e0c58}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=P|title=Foot strike patterns of recreational and sub-elite runners in a long-distance road race|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|year=2011|volume=29|issue=15|pages=1665\u20131673|doi=10.1080/02640414.2011.610347|pmid=22092253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Smeathers|first=J.E.|title=Transient Vibrations Caused by Heel Strike|journal= Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine|year=1989|volume=203|issue=4|pages=181\u2013186|doi=10.1243/PIME_PROC_1989_203_036_01|pmid=2701953}}</ref> These are characterized by initial contact of the ball of the foot, ball and heel of the foot simultaneously and heel of the foot respectively.  During this time the [[hip joint]] is undergoing extension from being in maximal flexion from the previous swing phase.  For proper force absorption, the knee joint should be flexed upon footstrike and the ankle should be slightly in front of the body.<ref name=\"Davis 1980 1590\u201395\">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=G.J.|title=Mechanisms of Selected Knee Injuries|journal=Journal of the American Physical Therapy Association|year=1980|volume=60|pages=1590\u20131595}}</ref>  Footstrike begins the absorption phase as forces from initial contact are attenuated throughout the lower extremity. Absorption of forces continues as the body moves from footstrike to midstance due to vertical propulsion from the toe-off during a previous gait cycle.\n\n===Midstance===\nMidstance is defined as the time at which the lower extremity limb of focus is in knee flexion directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hips.  It is at this point that propulsion begins to occur as the hips undergo hip extension, the knee joint undergoes extension and the ankle undergoes plantar flexion.  Propulsion continues until the leg is extended behind the body and toe off occurs.  This involves maximal hip extension, knee extension and plantar flexion for the subject, resulting in the body being pushed forward from this motion and the ankle/foot leaves the ground as initial swing begins.\n\n===Propulsion phase===\nMost recent research, particularly regarding the footstrike debate, has focused solely on the absorption phases for injury identification and prevention purposes.  The propulsion phase of running involves the movement beginning at midstance until toe off.<ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/><ref name=\"Novacheck 1998 77\u201395\"/><ref name=\"Hammer 2010 2709\u201316\">{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=S.R.|title=Muscle contributions to propulsion and support during running|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|year=2010|volume=43|issue=14|pages=2709\u20132716|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.06.025|pmc=2973845|pmid=20691972}}</ref>  From a full stride length model however, components of the terminal swing and footstrike can aid in propulsion.<ref name=\"Schache 1999 30\u201347\"/><ref name=\"Ardigo 2008 17\u201322\">{{cite journal|last=Ardigo|first=L.P.|title=Metabolic and mechanical aspects of foot landing type, forefoot and rearfoot strike, in human running|journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica|year=2008|volume=155|issue=1|pages=17\u201322|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1995.tb09943.x|pmid=8553873}}</ref>\nSet up for propulsion begins at the end of terminal swing as the hip joint flexes, creating the maximal range of motion for the hip extensors to accelerate through and produce force.

This can either occur by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or concentrically contracting from a heel strike.  With a forefoot strike, both the ankle and knee joints will release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase.<ref name=\"Kubo 2000 181\u2013187\"/><ref name=\"Magness\"/><ref name=\"Thys 1975 281\u2013286\"/>  The quadriceps group/knee extensors go into full knee extension, pushing the body off of the ground.  At the same time, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, adding to a pulling motion on the ground and beginning the initial swing phase.  The hip extensors extend to maximum, adding the forces pulling and pushing off of the ground.  The movement and momentum generated by the hip extensors also contributes to knee flexion and the beginning of the initial swing phase.\n\n===Swing phase===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ross Hill 2013 cropped.png|thumb|A runner entering the swing phase.]] -->\nInitial swing is the response of both stretch reflexes and concentric movements to the propulsion movements of the body.  Hip flexion and knee flexion occur beginning the return of the limb to the starting position and setting up for another footstrike.  Initial swing ends at midswing, when the limb is again directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hip with the knee joint flexed and hip flexion continuing.  Terminal swing then begins as hip flexion continues to the point of activation of the stretch reflex of the hip extensors.  The knee begins to extend slightly as it swings to the anterior portion of the body.  The foot then makes contact with the ground with footstrike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.\nEach limb of the lower extremity works opposite to the other.  When one side is in toe-off/propulsion, the other hand is in the swing/recovery phase preparing for footstrike.<ref name=\"Anderson 1996 76\u201389\"/><ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/><ref name=\"Novacheck 1998 77\u201395\"/><ref name=\"Schache 1999 30\u201347\"/>  Following toe-off and the beginning of the initial swing of one side, there is a flight phase where neither extremity is in contact with the ground due to the opposite side finishing terminal swing.  As the footstrike of the one hand occurs, initial swing continues.  The opposing limbs meet with one in midstance and midswing, beginning the propulsion and terminal swing phases.\n\n===Upper extremity function===\nUpper extremity function serves mainly in providing balance in conjunction with the opposing side of the lower extremity.<ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/>  The movement of each leg is paired with the opposite arm which serves to counterbalance the body, particularly during the stance phase.<ref name=\"Hammer 2010 2709\u201316\"/>  The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at an approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible.<ref name=\"Cavanagh 1990\">{{cite book|last=Cavanagh|first=P.R.|title=Biomechanics of Distance Running|year=1990|publisher=Human Kinetics Books|location=Champaign, I.L}}</ref>  The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing. It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored.  Thus trunk motion should remain mostly stable with little motion except for slight rotation as excessive movement would contribute to transverse motion and wasted energy.\n\n===Footstrike debate===\nRecent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences, in the potential [[injury]] risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes.  It has been shown that heel striking is generally associated with higher rates of injury and impact due to inefficient shock absorption and inefficient biomechanical compensations for these forces.<ref name=\"Daoud 2012 1325\u201334\"/>  This is due to forces from a heel strike traveling through bones for shock absorption rather than being absorbed by muscles.

It also makes it easier for the runner to avoid landing the foot in front of the center of mass and the resultant braking effect. While upright posture is essential, a runner should maintain a relaxed frame and use their core to keep posture upright and stable. This helps prevent injury as long as the body is neither rigid nor tense. The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders.<ref name=\"Dr. Michael Yessis 2000\">{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title= Explosive Running |publisher= McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |edition= 1st |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8092-9899-0 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/explosiverunning0000yess }}</ref>\n\n===Stride rate and types===\nExercise physiologists have found that the stride rates are extremely consistent across professional runners, between 185 and 200 steps per minute. The main difference between long- and short-distance runners is the length of stride rather than the rate of stride.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = K. | year = 1971 | title = Stature, leg length and stride frequency | journal=Track Technique | volume = 46 | pages = 1463\u20131469}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Rompottie | first= K. | year =1972 | title = A study of stride length in running | journal=International Track and Field | pages = 249\u2013256}}</ref>\n\nDuring running, the [[speed]] at which the runner moves may be calculated by multiplying the [[cadence (gait)|cadence]] (steps per second) by the stride length. Running is often measured in terms of pace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://revelsports.com/pace_Chart.htm|title=Revel Sports Pace Chart|work=revelsports.com}}</ref> in minutes per mile or kilometer. Different types of stride are necessary for different types of running. When sprinting, runners stay on their toes bringing their legs up, using shorter and faster strides.

Heel striking and leaning forward are some of the most common mistakes and cause of injuries among beginners.]]\nMany injuries are associated with running because of its high-impact nature. Change in running volume may lead to development of [[patellofemoral pain syndrome]], [[iliotibial band syndrome]], [[patellar tendinopathy]], [[plica syndrome]], and [[medial tibial stress syndrome]]. Change in running pace may cause [[Achilles Tendinitis]], [[gastrocnemius]] injuries, and [[plantar fasciitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=R.O|title=Classifying running-related injuries based upon etiology, with emphasis on volume and pace|journal=International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=172\u2013179}}</ref> Repetitive stress on the same tissues without enough time for recovery or running with improper form can lead to many of the above. Runners generally attempt to minimize these injuries by warming up before exercise,<ref name=\"Davis 1980 1590\u201395\" />  focusing on proper running form, performing strength training exercises, eating a well balanced diet, allowing time for recovery, and \"icing\" (applying ice to sore muscles or taking an ice bath).\n\nSome runners may experience injuries when running on concrete surfaces. The problem with running on [[concrete]] is that the body adjusts to this flat surface running, and some of the muscles will become weaker, along with the added impact of running on a harder surface. Therefore, it is advised{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to change terrain occasionally \u2013 such as trail, beach, or grass running. This is more unstable ground and allows the legs to strengthen different muscles. Runners should be wary of twisting their ankles on such terrain. Running downhill also increases knee stress and should, therefore, be avoided. Reducing the frequency and duration can also prevent injury.\n\n[[Barefoot running]] has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries,<ref name=\"Barefoot\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06157/696125-114.stm|title=Health Journal: Is barefoot better?|last=Parker-Pope|first=T|date=2006-06-06|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref> but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/business/30shoe.html|title=Wiggling Their Toes at the Shoe Giants|last=Cortese|first=A|date=2009-08-29|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Foot pronation is not associated with increased injury risk in novice runners wearing a neutral shoe: a 1-year prospective cohort study|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2013/06/12/bjsports-2013-092202.short?rss=1|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|issue=6|pages=440\u2013447|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2013-092202|pmid=23766439|authors=Rasmus Oestergaard Nielsen, Ida Buist, Erik Thorlund Parner, Ellen Aagaard Nohr, Henrik S\u00f8rensen, Martin Lind, Sten Rasmussen}}</ref>\n\n=== Chafing ===\n[[File:Chafing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Chafing of skin following a marathon run]]\nAnother common, running-related injury is [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]], caused by repetitive rubbing of one piece of skin against another, or against an article of clothing. One common location for chafe to occur is the runner's upper thighs. The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look. A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems. Chafe is also likely to occur on the [[jogger's nipple|nipple]]. There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with chafing while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction.

This is an injury that is located at the knee and shows symptoms of swelling outside the knee. Iliotibial band syndrome is also known as \"runner's knee\" or \"jogger's knee\" because it can be caused by jogging or running. Once pain or swelling is noticeable it is important to put ice on it immediately and it's recommended to rest the knee for better healing.<ref>Rothfeld, G. S., & Romaine, D. S. (2017). jogger's knee.

Shin Splints have sharp, splinter-like pain, that is typically X- rayed by doctors but is not necessary for shin splints to be diagnosed.

As a sport, it is split into events divided by distance and sometimes includes permutations such as the obstacles in [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] and [[hurdles]]. Running races are contests to determine which of the competitors is able to run a certain distance in the shortest time. Today, competitive running events make up the core of the [[sport of athletics]]. Events are usually grouped into several classes, each requiring substantially different athletic strengths and involving different tactics, training methods, and types of competitors.\n\nRunning competitions have probably existed for most of humanity's history and were a key part of the [[ancient Olympic Games]] as well as the modern Olympics. The activity of running went through a period of widespread popularity in the United States during the [[running boom of the 1970s]]. Over the next two decades, as many as 25 million Americans were doing some form of running or jogging \u2013 accounting for roughly one tenth of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/fitness/running-and-jogging-for-fitness|title=Health Benefits of Jogging and Running|work=MotleyHealth}}</ref> Today, road racing is a popular sport among non-professional athletes, who included over 7.7&nbsp;million people in America alone in 2002.<ref>USA Track & Field (2003).

It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports.\n\nThe fastest human footspeed on record is 44.7&nbsp;km/h (12.4&nbsp;m/s, 27.8&nbsp;mph), seen during a 100-meter sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by [[Usain Bolt]].<ref>[http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Biomechanical Research Project: Berlin 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514050117/http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf |date=14 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Running speed over increasing distance based on world record times===\n(see [[:Category:Athletics (track and field) record progressions]])\n[[File:Human speed distance portrait.png|thumb|Maximum human speed [km/h] and pace [min/km] per distance]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The events are categorized as [[sprint (running)|sprints]], [[middle-distance running|middle]] and [[Long-distance track event|long-distance]], and [[hurdling]].\n\n;Road running\n{{Main|Road running}}\nRoad running takes place on a measured course over an established road (as opposed to [[track running|track]] and [[cross country running]]). These events normally range from distances of 5 kilometers to longer distances such as [[half marathon]]s and [[marathons]], and they may involve scores of runners or wheelchair entrants.\n\n;Cross-country running\n{{Main|Cross country running|Fell running|Trail running}}\nCross country running takes place over the open or rough terrain. The courses used for these events may include [[Poaceae|grass]], [[mud]], woodlands, hills, flat ground and water. It is a popular participatory sport and is one of the events which, along with track and field, road running, and [[racewalking]], makes up the umbrella sport of athletics.\n\n;Vertical running\n{{Main|Fell running|Mountain running|Skyrunning|Trail running|Tower running}}\nThe majority of popular races do not incorporate a significant change in elevation as a key component of a course. There are several, disparate variations that feature significant inclines or declines. These fall into two main groups.\n\nThe naturalistic group is based on outdoor racing over geographical features. Among these are the cross country-related sports of [[fell running]] (a tradition associated with Northern Europe) and [[trail running]] (mainly [[ultramarathon]] distances), the running/climbing combination of [[skyrunning]] (organised by the [[International Skyrunning Federation]] with races across North America, Europe and East Asia) and the mainly trail- and road-centred [[mountain running]] (governed by the [[World Mountain Running Association]] and based mainly in Europe).\n\nThe second variety of vertical running is based on human structures, such as stairs and man-made slopes. The foremost type of this is [[tower running]], which sees athletes compete indoors, running up steps within very tall structures such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] or [[Empire State Building]].\n\n===Events by distance===\n\n====Sprints====\n{{Main|Sprint (running)}}\n[[File:Sina Schielke (192) wins the 100 metres race - ISTAF 2006 - Berlin, 3 September.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|International-level women athletes competing in 100 m sprint race at [[ISTAF Berlin]], 2006]]\n\nSprints are short running events in athletics and track and field. Races over short distances are among the oldest running competitions.

Common footstrike types include forefoot, midfoot and heel strike types.<ref name=\"Daoud 2012 1325\u201334\">{{cite journal|last=Daoud|first=A.I.|title=Foot Strike and Injury Rates in Endurance Runners: a retrospective study|journal= Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|year=2012|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1325\u20131334|doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3182465115|pmid=22217561|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c631ea6d9af38687347516d10748825a2c4e0c58}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=P|title=Foot strike patterns of recreational and sub-elite runners in a long-distance road race|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|year=2011|volume=29|issue=15|pages=1665\u20131673|doi=10.1080/02640414.2011.610347|pmid=22092253}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Smeathers|first=J.E.|title=Transient Vibrations Caused by Heel Strike|journal= Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine|year=1989|volume=203|issue=4|pages=181\u2013186|doi=10.1243/PIME_PROC_1989_203_036_01|pmid=2701953}}</ref> These are characterized by initial contact of the ball of the foot, ball and heel of the foot simultaneously and heel of the foot respectively.

Absorption of forces continues as the body moves from footstrike to midstance due to vertical propulsion from the toe-off during a previous gait cycle.\n\n===Midstance===\nMidstance is defined as the time at which the lower extremity limb of focus is in knee flexion directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hips.  It is at this point that propulsion begins to occur as the hips undergo hip extension, the knee joint undergoes extension and the ankle undergoes plantar flexion.  Propulsion continues until the leg is extended behind the body and toe off occurs.  This involves maximal hip extension, knee extension and plantar flexion for the subject, resulting in the body being pushed forward from this motion and the ankle/foot leaves the ground as initial swing begins.\n\n===Propulsion phase===\nMost recent research, particularly regarding the footstrike debate, has focused solely on the absorption phases for injury identification and prevention purposes.  The propulsion phase of running involves the movement beginning at midstance until toe off.<ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/><ref name=\"Novacheck 1998 77\u201395\"/><ref name=\"Hammer 2010 2709\u201316\">{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=S.R.|title=Muscle contributions to propulsion and support during running|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|year=2010|volume=43|issue=14|pages=2709\u20132716|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.06.025|pmc=2973845|pmid=20691972}}</ref>  From a full stride length model however, components of the terminal swing and footstrike can aid in propulsion.<ref name=\"Schache 1999 30\u201347\"/><ref name=\"Ardigo 2008 17\u201322\">{{cite journal|last=Ardigo|first=L.P.|title=Metabolic and mechanical aspects of foot landing type, forefoot and rearfoot strike, in human running|journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica|year=2008|volume=155|issue=1|pages=17\u201322|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1995.tb09943.x|pmid=8553873}}</ref>\nSet up for propulsion begins at the end of terminal swing as the hip joint flexes, creating the maximal range of motion for the hip extensors to accelerate through and produce force.

This can either occur by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or concentrically contracting from a heel strike.  With a forefoot strike, both the ankle and knee joints will release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase.<ref name=\"Kubo 2000 181\u2013187\"/><ref name=\"Magness\"/><ref name=\"Thys 1975 281\u2013286\"/>  The quadriceps group/knee extensors go into full knee extension, pushing the body off of the ground.  At the same time, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, adding to a pulling motion on the ground and beginning the initial swing phase.  The hip extensors extend to maximum, adding the forces pulling and pushing off of the ground.  The movement and momentum generated by the hip extensors also contributes to knee flexion and the beginning of the initial swing phase.\n\n===Swing phase===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ross Hill 2013 cropped.png|thumb|A runner entering the swing phase.]] -->\nInitial swing is the response of both stretch reflexes and concentric movements to the propulsion movements of the body.  Hip flexion and knee flexion occur beginning the return of the limb to the starting position and setting up for another footstrike.  Initial swing ends at midswing, when the limb is again directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hip with the knee joint flexed and hip flexion continuing.  Terminal swing then begins as hip flexion continues to the point of activation of the stretch reflex of the hip extensors.  The knee begins to extend slightly as it swings to the anterior portion of the body.  The foot then makes contact with the ground with footstrike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.\nEach limb of the lower extremity works opposite to the other.  When one side is in toe-off/propulsion, the other hand is in the swing/recovery phase preparing for footstrike.<ref name=\"Anderson 1996 76\u201389\"/><ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/><ref name=\"Novacheck 1998 77\u201395\"/><ref name=\"Schache 1999 30\u201347\"/>  Following toe-off and the beginning of the initial swing of one side, there is a flight phase where neither extremity is in contact with the ground due to the opposite side finishing terminal swing.  As the footstrike of the one hand occurs, initial swing continues.  The opposing limbs meet with one in midstance and midswing, beginning the propulsion and terminal swing phases.\n\n===Upper extremity function===\nUpper extremity function serves mainly in providing balance in conjunction with the opposing side of the lower extremity.<ref name=\"Nicola 2012 187\u2013201\"/>  The movement of each leg is paired with the opposite arm which serves to counterbalance the body, particularly during the stance phase.<ref name=\"Hammer 2010 2709\u201316\"/>  The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at an approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible.<ref name=\"Cavanagh 1990\">{{cite book|last=Cavanagh|first=P.R.|title=Biomechanics of Distance Running|year=1990|publisher=Human Kinetics Books|location=Champaign, I.L}}</ref>  The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing. It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored.  Thus trunk motion should remain mostly stable with little motion except for slight rotation as excessive movement would contribute to transverse motion and wasted energy.\n\n===Footstrike debate===\nRecent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences, in the potential [[injury]] risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes.  It has been shown that heel striking is generally associated with higher rates of injury and impact due to inefficient shock absorption and inefficient biomechanical compensations for these forces.<ref name=\"Daoud 2012 1325\u201334\"/>  This is due to forces from a heel strike traveling through bones for shock absorption rather than being absorbed by muscles.  Since bones cannot disperse forces easily, the forces are transmitted to other parts of the body, including ligaments, joints and bones in the rest of the lower extremity all the way up to the lower back.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdini|first=F.|title=Identification and characterization of heel strike transient|journal=Gait & Posture|year=2005|volume=24|issue=1|pages=77\u201384|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2005.07.008|pmid=16263287}}</ref>  This causes the body to use abnormal compensatory motions in an attempt to avoid serious bone injuries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=N.E.|title=Stress fractures in young athletes|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|year=1977|volume=5|issue=4|pages=165\u2013170|doi=10.1177/036354657700500405|pmid=883588}}</ref>  These compensations include internal rotation of the tibia, knee and hip joints.

It also makes it easier for the runner to avoid landing the foot in front of the center of mass and the resultant braking effect. While upright posture is essential, a runner should maintain a relaxed frame and use their core to keep posture upright and stable. This helps prevent injury as long as the body is neither rigid nor tense. The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders.<ref name=\"Dr. Michael Yessis 2000\">{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title= Explosive Running |publisher= McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |edition= 1st |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8092-9899-0 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/explosiverunning0000yess }}</ref>\n\n===Stride rate and types===\nExercise physiologists have found that the stride rates are extremely consistent across professional runners, between 185 and 200 steps per minute.

If a runner feels that the pace or distance is no longer challenging, then the runner may want to speed up or run farther.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.active.com/running/articles/how-fast-should-beginners-run|title=How Fast Should Beginners Run?|access-date=2016-08-02|date=February 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mental health ===\nRunning can also have psychological benefits, as many participants in the sport report feeling an elated, euphoric state, often referred to as a \"[[runner's high]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Boecker | first1 = H. \n| last2 = Sprenger | first2 = T. \n| last3 = Spilker | first3 = M.

It helps people who struggle with seasonal affective disorder by running outside when it's sunny and warm. Running can improve mental alertness and also improves sleep, which is needed for good mental health.

Heel striking and leaning forward are some of the most common mistakes and cause of injuries among beginners.]]\nMany injuries are associated with running because of its high-impact nature. Change in running volume may lead to development of [[patellofemoral pain syndrome]], [[iliotibial band syndrome]], [[patellar tendinopathy]], [[plica syndrome]], and [[medial tibial stress syndrome]]. Change in running pace may cause [[Achilles Tendinitis]], [[gastrocnemius]] injuries, and [[plantar fasciitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=R.O|title=Classifying running-related injuries based upon etiology, with emphasis on volume and pace|journal=International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=172\u2013179}}</ref> Repetitive stress on the same tissues without enough time for recovery or running with improper form can lead to many of the above. Runners generally attempt to minimize these injuries by warming up before exercise,<ref name=\"Davis 1980 1590\u201395\" />  focusing on proper running form, performing strength training exercises, eating a well balanced diet, allowing time for recovery, and \"icing\" (applying ice to sore muscles or taking an ice bath).\n\nSome runners may experience injuries when running on concrete surfaces. The problem with running on [[concrete]] is that the body adjusts to this flat surface running, and some of the muscles will become weaker, along with the added impact of running on a harder surface. Therefore, it is advised{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to change terrain occasionally \u2013 such as trail, beach, or grass running. This is more unstable ground and allows the legs to strengthen different muscles. Runners should be wary of twisting their ankles on such terrain. Running downhill also increases knee stress and should, therefore, be avoided. Reducing the frequency and duration can also prevent injury.\n\n[[Barefoot running]] has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries,<ref name=\"Barefoot\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06157/696125-114.stm|title=Health Journal: Is barefoot better?|last=Parker-Pope|first=T|date=2006-06-06|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref> but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/business/30shoe.html|title=Wiggling Their Toes at the Shoe Giants|last=Cortese|first=A|date=2009-08-29|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Foot pronation is not associated with increased injury risk in novice runners wearing a neutral shoe: a 1-year prospective cohort study|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2013/06/12/bjsports-2013-092202.short?rss=1|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|issue=6|pages=440\u2013447|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2013-092202|pmid=23766439|authors=Rasmus Oestergaard Nielsen, Ida Buist, Erik Thorlund Parner, Ellen Aagaard Nohr, Henrik S\u00f8rensen, Martin Lind, Sten Rasmussen}}</ref>\n\n=== Chafing ===\n[[File:Chafing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Chafing of skin following a marathon run]]\nAnother common, running-related injury is [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]], caused by repetitive rubbing of one piece of skin against another, or against an article of clothing. One common location for chafe to occur is the runner's upper thighs. The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look. A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems. Chafe is also likely to occur on the [[jogger's nipple|nipple]]. There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with chafing while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction. Prevention is key which is why form fitting clothes are important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/chafing/how-to-prevent-treat-chafing|title=How to Prevent & Treat Chafing|date=2015-05-27|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Iliotibial band syndrome ===\nAn iliotibial band is a muscle and tendon that is attached to the hip and runs the length of the thigh to attach to the upper part of the tibia, and the band is what helps the knee to bend. This is an injury that is located at the knee and shows symptoms of swelling outside the knee. Iliotibial band syndrome is also known as \"runner's knee\" or \"jogger's knee\" because it can be caused by jogging or running. Once pain or swelling is noticeable it is important to put ice on it immediately and it's recommended to rest the knee for better healing.<ref>Rothfeld, G. S., & Romaine, D. S. (2017). jogger's knee.

This is caused during running when the muscle is being overused along the front of the lower leg with symptoms that affect 2 to 6 inches of the muscle. Shin Splints have sharp, splinter-like pain, that is typically X- rayed by doctors but is not necessary for shin splints to be diagnosed. To help prevent shin splints it's commonly known to stretch before and after a workout session, and also avoid heavy equipment especially during the first couple of workout sessions.<ref>shinsplints.

As a sport, it is split into events divided by distance and sometimes includes permutations such as the obstacles in [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] and [[hurdles]]. Running races are contests to determine which of the competitors is able to run a certain distance in the shortest time. Today, competitive running events make up the core of the [[sport of athletics]]. Events are usually grouped into several classes, each requiring substantially different athletic strengths and involving different tactics, training methods, and types of competitors.\n\nRunning competitions have probably existed for most of humanity's history and were a key part of the [[ancient Olympic Games]] as well as the modern Olympics. The activity of running went through a period of widespread popularity in the United States during the [[running boom of the 1970s]]. Over the next two decades, as many as 25 million Americans were doing some form of running or jogging \u2013 accounting for roughly one tenth of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/fitness/running-and-jogging-for-fitness|title=Health Benefits of Jogging and Running|work=MotleyHealth}}</ref> Today, road racing is a popular sport among non-professional athletes, who included over 7.7&nbsp;million people in America alone in 2002.<ref>USA Track & Field (2003).

It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports.\n\nThe fastest human footspeed on record is 44.7&nbsp;km/h (12.4&nbsp;m/s, 27.8&nbsp;mph), seen during a 100-meter sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by [[Usain Bolt]].<ref>[http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Biomechanical Research Project: Berlin 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514050117/http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf |date=14 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Running speed over increasing distance based on world record times===\n(see [[:Category:Athletics (track and field) record progressions]])\n[[File:Human speed distance portrait.png|thumb|Maximum human speed [km/h] and pace [min/km] per distance]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The events are categorized as [[sprint (running)|sprints]], [[middle-distance running|middle]] and [[Long-distance track event|long-distance]], and [[hurdling]].\n\n;Road running\n{{Main|Road running}}\nRoad running takes place on a measured course over an established road (as opposed to [[track running|track]] and [[cross country running]]). These events normally range from distances of 5 kilometers to longer distances such as [[half marathon]]s and [[marathons]], and they may involve scores of runners or wheelchair entrants.\n\n;Cross-country running\n{{Main|Cross country running|Fell running|Trail running}}\nCross country running takes place over the open or rough terrain. The courses used for these events may include [[Poaceae|grass]], [[mud]], woodlands, hills, flat ground and water. It is a popular participatory sport and is one of the events which, along with track and field, road running, and [[racewalking]], makes up the umbrella sport of athletics.\n\n;Vertical running\n{{Main|Fell running|Mountain running|Skyrunning|Trail running|Tower running}}\nThe majority of popular races do not incorporate a significant change in elevation as a key component of a course. There are several, disparate variations that feature significant inclines or declines. These fall into two main groups.\n\nThe naturalistic group is based on outdoor racing over geographical features. Among these are the cross country-related sports of [[fell running]] (a tradition associated with Northern Europe) and [[trail running]] (mainly [[ultramarathon]] distances), the running/climbing combination of [[skyrunning]] (organised by the [[International Skyrunning Federation]] with races across North America, Europe and East Asia) and the mainly trail- and road-centred [[mountain running]] (governed by the [[World Mountain Running Association]] and based mainly in Europe).\n\nThe second variety of vertical running is based on human structures, such as stairs and man-made slopes. The foremost type of this is [[tower running]], which sees athletes compete indoors, running up steps within very tall structures such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] or [[Empire State Building]].\n\n===Events by distance===\n\n====Sprints====\n{{Main|Sprint (running)}}\n[[File:Sina Schielke (192) wins the 100 metres race - ISTAF 2006 - Berlin, 3 September.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|International level women athletes competing in 100 m sprint race at [[ISTAF Berlin]], 2006]]\n\nSprints are short running events in athletics and track and field.

D-series version is called D16A1, 1986-1987.\n\n2nd Gen ZC (rarest) \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB mounted on slight angle forward, bolts on top of cam cover, black cam cover, large cam pulleys. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC appeared in JDM facelift AV bodied Integra Si did not appear in Civic or CR-X, rarest ZC only produced for less than one year. D-series version D16A1 '88-'89 (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n3rd Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB. Black cam cover. Cam cover bolts on the sides. Small cam pulleys. Inlet Manifold stamped PM7. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a \"ZC\" this appeared in the JDM EF3 Civic and EF7 CR-X, and also in the JDM Honda Quint Integra GSi (DA1 chassis). This is the most commonly produced ZC, manufactured in Japan from end of '87 through to early '91 D-series version D16A8/9 (Euro Civic Si) (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n4th Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil. OBD1 EFi system (grey plug). No cam angle sensor on exhaust cam, now located in distributor. Rubber plug where cam angle sensor would mount. Black cam cover. No PGM-EFi plate on the inlet manifold, replaced with three ribs instead. P29 stamped on inlet manifold. MAP sensor on TB. +7cc PM7 pistons, pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC only appeared in EG5 Civic bodies, no Integra or CRX received this engine. Reasonably common produced from '92 to '94.

Large cam pulleys. +3cc PG6B pistons, non-pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC it appeared in JDM AV Integra Si and JDM E-AT Civic/CR-X Si. Commonly produced at the time but now over twenty years old and getting harder to find. D-series version is called D16A1, 1986-1987.\n\n2nd Gen ZC (rarest) \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB mounted on slight angle forward, bolts on top of cam cover, black cam cover, large cam pulleys. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC appeared in JDM facelift AV bodied Integra Si did not appear in Civic or CR-X, rarest ZC only produced for less than one year. D-series version D16A1 '88-'89 (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n3rd Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB. Black cam cover. Cam cover bolts on the sides. Small cam pulleys. Inlet Manifold stamped PM7. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a \"ZC\" this appeared in the JDM EF3 Civic and EF7 CR-X, and also in the JDM Honda Quint Integra GSi (DA1 chassis). This is the most commonly produced ZC, manufactured in Japan from end of '87 through to early '91 D-series version D16A8/9 (Euro Civic Si) (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n4th Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil. OBD1 EFi system (grey plug). No cam angle sensor on exhaust cam, now located in distributor. Rubber plug where cam angle sensor would mount. Black cam cover. No PGM-EFi plate on the inlet manifold, replaced with three ribs instead. P29 stamped on inlet manifold. MAP sensor on TB. +7cc PM7 pistons, pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC only appeared in EG5 Civic bodies, no Integra or CRX received this engine. Reasonably common produced from '92 to '94.

Benjamin Barber similarly questions the impact of [[economic globalization]] as well as its problems for democracy.\n\nThe book was based on a March 1992 article by Barber first published in ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref name=JIHAD-VS-MCWORLD>{{cite news |last=Barber |first=Benjamin |title=Jihad vs. McWorld |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199203/barber |date=March 1992 |publisher=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]] |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref> The book employs the basic critique of [[neoliberalism]] seen in Barber's earlier, seminal work ''[[Strong Democracy]]''. As [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economic theory]]\u2014not to be confused with [[social liberalism]]\u2014is the force behind globalization, this critique is relevant on a much larger scale. Unregulated market forces encounter [[Parochialism|parochial]] (which he calls [[Tribe|tribal]]) forces.\n\nThese tribal forces come in many varieties: religious, cultural, ethnic, regional, local, etc. As globalization imposes a culture of its own on a population, the tribal forces feel threatened and react. More than just economic, the crises that arise from these confrontations often take on a sacred quality to the tribal elements; thus Barber's use of the term \"Jihad\" (although in the second edition, he expresses regret at having used that term).{{why|date=April 2017}}\n\nBarber's prognosis in ''Jihad vs McWorld'' is generally negative\u2014he concludes that neither global corporations nor traditional cultures are supportive of [[democracy]]. He further posits that [[McWorld]] could ultimately win the \"struggle\".  He also proposes a model for [[Parochialism|small, local]] democratic institutions and [[civic engagement]] as the hope for an alternative to these two forces.\n\n== Problems for democracy ==\nBarber states that neither Jihad nor McWorld needs or promotes democracy.<ref>Frank J. Lechner and John Boli., ''The Globalization Reader: Fourth Edition'', Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2012</ref>\n\n=== McWorld ===\nBarber argues that there are several imperatives that make up the McWorld, or the globalization of [[politics]]: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an information-technology imperative, and an ecological imperative. Due to globalization, our market has expanded and is vulnerable to the transnational markets where free trade, easy access to banking and exchange of currency are available. With the emergence of our markets, we have come up with international laws and treaties in order to maintain stability and efficiency in the interconnected economy. Resources are also an imperative aspect in the McWorld, where autarky seems insufficient and inefficient in presence of globalization. The information-technology of globalization has opened up communications to people all over the world, allowing us to exchange information. Also, technology is now systematically integrated into everyone's lives to the point where it \"gives every person on earth access to every other person\".<ref>Frank J. Lechner and John Boli., ''The Globalization Reader: Fourth Edition'', Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2012 pg.30</ref> Globalization of ecology may seem cliche; Barber argues that whatever a nation does to their own ecology, it affects everyone on Earth. For instance, cutting down a jungle will upset the overall oxygen balance, which affects our \"global lungs\". McWorld may promote peace and prosperity, but Barber sees this as being done at the cost of [[independence]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and notes that no more social justice or equality than necessary are needed to promote efficient economic production and consumption.\n\n=== Jihad ===\nBarber sees Jihad as offering solidarity and protecting identities, but at the potential cost of tolerance and stability. Barber describes the solidarity needed within the concept of Jihad as being secured through exclusion and war against outsiders. As a result, he argues, different forms of anti-democratization can arise through anti-democratic one-party dictatorships, military juntas, or theocratic fundamentalism. Barber also describes through modern day examples what these 'players' are. \"[T]hey are cultures, not countries; parts, not wholes; sects, not religions, rebellious factions and dissenting minorities at war not just with globalism but with the traditional nation-state. Kurds, Basques, Puerto Ricans, Ossetians, East Timoreans, Quebecois, the Catholics of Northern Ireland, Catalans, Tamils, and of course, Palestinians \u2013 people with countries, inhabiting nations not their own, seeking smaller worlds within borders that will seal them off from modernity.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Globalization Reader|last = Lechner|first = Frank J.|publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year = 2015|isbn = |location = United Kingdom|pages = 36}}</ref>\n\n===Confederal option ===\nBarber writes democracy can be spread and secured through the world satisfying the needs of both the McWorld and Jihad. \"With its concern for accountability, the protection of minorities, and the universal rule of law, a confederalized representative system would serve the political needs of McWorld as well as oligarchic bureaucratism or meritocratic elitism is currently doing.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Some can accept democracy faster than others. Every case is different, however \"Democracy grows from the bottom up and cannot be imposed from the top down. Civil society has to be built from the inside out.\"<ref name=JIHAD-VS-MCWORLD /> He goes on to further explain exactly what the confederal option means and how it will help. \"It certainly seems possible that the most attractive democratic ideal in the face of the brutal realities of Jihad and the dull realities of McWorld will be a confederal union of semi autonomous communities smaller than nation-states, tied together into regional economic associations and markets larger than nation-states\u2014participatory and self-determining in local matters at the bottom, representative and accountable at the top. The nation-state would play a diminished role, and sovereignty would lose some of its political potency.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''\n* ''[[The McDonaldization of Society]]''\n* ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]''\n\n==References==\n* [[Benjamin Barber|Barber, Benjamin R.]], ''Jihad vs. McWorld'', Hardcover: Crown, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8129-2350-2}}; Paperback: Ballantine Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-345-38304-4}}\n* Frank J.

Their fortunes take a turn after they accidentally bump into an underworld don Bose ([[Prem Chopra]]) whilst he is about to die, who tells them about a hidden treasure in [[Goa]] including {{INR}}10crores under a big 'W'. The group race towards Goa in Nari's stolen car, little knowing that their plans will soon be foiled, albeit hilariously, by Police Inspector Kabir Nayak ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), who wants the money at any cost.\nKabir meets those 'four friends' and made a deal. They go to Goa and discover the big 'W'. They took the money, but accidentally they came to a charity function with a huge amount of money and they have to give the money to orphan children.\n\n===''Double Dhamaal'' (2011)===\n{{Main|Double Dhamaal}}\nThe story continues from the previous film. The four good-for-nothing friends Roy ([[Ritesh Deshmukh|Ritesh]]), Adi ([[Arshad Warsi|Arshad]]), Manav ([[Jaaved Jaaferi|Jaaved]]) and Boman ([[Aashish Chaudhary|Aashish]]), are still conning people for a living. One day, they see their enemy Kabir ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) driving a luxurious [[Mercedes Benz]], and disguise themselves to find out the secret behind his success. They investigate and find that he lives off his wife's wealth. They then blackmail him into making them his business partners, but little do the four idiots know that Kabir and his wife Kamini ([[Mallika Sherawat|Mallika]]) along with his sister Kiya ([[Kangana Ranaut|Ranaut]]) have an agenda of their own. Kabir connects them with an investor named Bata Bhai ([[Satish Kaushik]]) who is also a part-time don. The four friends steal Bata Bhai's money, and the money is then stolen by Kabir and his family. Kabir leaves the country along with his family and leaves the four idiots to get killed by Bata Bhai. However, the four friends leave the city and manage to track Kabir down in [[Macau]]. They make a plan to ruin Kabir's happiness and take their money back by going in disguise. Roy cons Kiya by pretending to be in love with her, whilst Adi pretends to be Kabir's secretary.\n\n===''Total Dhamaal'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Total Dhamaal}}\nThe film does not continue the story from the previous films and is a fresh story.\n\nGuddu ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and Jonny ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]), small-time conmen get double-crossed of their illegal booty by their own colleague Pintu ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) after which starts a mad crazy adventure between Guddu-Jonny and 4 other groups i.e. Avinash ([[Anil Kapoor]]) and Bindu ([[Madhuri Dixit]]) - a bickering couple about to be divorced; Lallan ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Jhingur ([[Pitobash Tripathy]]) - Fire officers turned offenders; a police commissioner ([[Boman Irani]]) and his sidekick Inspector ([[Vijay Patkar]]); and two weird siblings Aditya ([[Arshad Warsi]]) and Manav ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) for {{INRConvert|50|c}} which was hidden by Pintu in Omkar Zoo in Janakpur.\n\n===''Full On Dhamaal'' (TBA)===\nAfter the trailer release of '''[[Total Dhamaal]]''', in an interview, director [[Indra Kumar]] said that another '''Dhamaal''' sequel is definitely on the cards and added that he has already registered two titles - '''Triple Dhamaal''' and '''Full On Dhamaal''' - for the next {{not a typo|installment}} of the franchise. \nWith the third film named '''[[Total Dhamaal]]''', the fourth film will most probably be titled '''Full On Dhamaal'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-look-forward-to/total-dhamaal-director-indra-kumar-plans-next-instalment-registers-two-titles-triple-dhamaal-and-full-on-dhamaal/photostory/67635066.cms|website=Times of India|title= 'Total Dhamaal' director Indra Kumar plans next instalment; registers two titles - 'Triple Dhamaal' and 'Full On Dhamaal'|date=22 January 2019|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Sanjay Dutt]] and [[Aashish Chaudhary]] who were part of first two films but not the third film are expected to return for the fourth film along with [[Ajay Devgn]], [[Riteish Deshmukh]], [[Arshad Warsi]], [[Javed Jaffrey]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n* This table shows characters that have appeared in one or more films in the series.\n* An empty dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the film, or that the character's presence in the film has yet to be announced.\n* {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates a role as a younger version of the character.\n* {{note label|old|O|}} indicates a role as an older version of the character.\n* {{note label|uncredited|U|}} indicates an uncredited role.\n* {{note label|cameo|C|}} indicates a cameo role.\n* {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role\n* {{note label|stills|S|}} indicates a stills or photographs role.\n* {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"4\" | Film\n|-\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2007)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Double Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2011)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Total Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2019)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Full on Dhamaal]]'' <br>(TBA)\n|-\n!

Their fortunes take a turn after they accidentally bump into an underworld don Bose ([[Prem Chopra]]) whilst he is about to die, who tells them about a hidden treasure in [[Goa]] including {{INR}}10crores under a big 'W'. The group race towards Goa in Nari's stolen car, little knowing that their plans will soon be foiled, albeit hilariously, by Police Inspector Kabir Nayak ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), who wants the money at any cost.\nKabir meets those 'four friends' and made a deal. They go to Goa and discover the big 'W'. They took the money, but accidentally they came to a charity function with a huge amount of money and they have to give the money to orphan children.\n\n===''Double Dhamaal'' (2011)===\n{{Main|Double Dhamaal}}\nThe story continues from the previous film. The four good-for-nothing friends Roy ([[Ritesh Deshmukh|Ritesh]]), Adi ([[Arshad Warsi|Arshad]]), Manav ([[Jaaved Jaaferi|Jaaved]]) and Boman ([[Aashish Chaudhary|Aashish]]), are still conning people for a living. One day, they see their enemy Kabir ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) driving a luxurious [[Mercedes Benz]], and disguise themselves to find out the secret behind his success. They investigate and find that he lives off his wife's wealth. They then blackmail him into making them his business partners, but little do the four idiots know that Kabir and his wife Kamini ([[Mallika Sherawat|Mallika]]) along with his sister Kiya ([[Kangana Ranaut|Ranaut]]) have an agenda of their own. Kabir connects them with an investor named Bata Bhai ([[Satish Kaushik]]) who is also a part-time don. The four friends steal Bata Bhai's money, and the money is then stolen by Kabir and his family. Kabir leaves the country along with his family and leaves the four idiots to get killed by Bata Bhai. However, the four friends leave the city and manage to track Kabir down in [[Macau]]. They make a plan to ruin Kabir's happiness and take their money back by going in disguise. Roy cons Kiya by pretending to be in love with her, whilst Adi pretends to be Kabir's secretary.\n\n===''Total Dhamaal'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Total Dhamaal}}\nThe film does not continue the story from the previous films and is a fresh story.\n\nGuddu ([[Ajay Devgn]]) and Jonny ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]), small-time conmen get double-crossed of their illegal booty by their own colleague Pintu ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) after which starts a mad crazy adventure between Guddu-Jonny and 4 other groups i.e Avinash ([[Anil Kapoor]]) and Bindu ([[Madhuri Dixit]]) - a bickering couple about to be divorced; Lallan ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Jhingur ([[Pitobash Tripathy]]) - Fire officers turned offenders; a police commissioner ([[Boman Irani]]) and his sidekick Inspector ([[Vijay Patkar]]); and two weird siblings Aditya ([[Arshad Warsi]]) and Manav ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) for {{INRConvert|50|c}} which was hidden by Pintu in Omkar Zoo in Janakpur.\n\n===''Full On Dhamaal'' (TBA)===\nAfter the trailer release of '''[[Total Dhamaal]]''', in an interview, director [[Indra Kumar]] said that another '''Dhamaal''' sequel is definitely on the cards and added that he has already registered two titles - '''Triple Dhamaal''' and '''Full On Dhamaal''' - for the next {{not a typo|installment}} of the franchise. \nWith the third film named '''[[Total Dhamaal]]''', the fourth film will most probably be titled '''Full On Dhamaal'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-look-forward-to/total-dhamaal-director-indra-kumar-plans-next-instalment-registers-two-titles-triple-dhamaal-and-full-on-dhamaal/photostory/67635066.cms|website=Times of India|title= 'Total Dhamaal' director Indra Kumar plans next instalment; registers two titles - 'Triple Dhamaal' and 'Full On Dhamaal'|date=22 January 2019|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> \n\n[[Sanjay Dutt]] and [[Aashish Chaudhary]] who were part of first two films but not the third film are expected to return for the fourth film along with [[Ajay Devgn]], [[Riteish Deshmukh]], [[Arshad Warsi]], [[Javed Jaffrey]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n* This table shows characters that have appeared in one or more films in the series.\n* An empty dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the film, or that the character's presence in the film has yet to be announced.\n* {{note label|young|Y|}} indicates a role as a younger version of the character.\n* {{note label|old|O|}} indicates a role as an older version of the character.\n* {{note label|uncredited|U|}} indicates an uncredited role.\n* {{note label|cameo|C|}} indicates a cameo role.\n* {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role\n* {{note label|stills|S|}} indicates a stills or photographs role.\n* {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates an appearance through archival footage.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"4\" | Film\n|-\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2007)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Double Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2011)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Total Dhamaal]]'' <br>(2019)\n!  width:33%;\"| ''[[Full on Dhamaal]]'' <br>(TBA)\n|-\n!

The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]] climates. \n\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|11.0|22.0|48.9\n|10.0|21.0|50.1\n|9.0|20.0|52.5\n|9.0|20.0|56.4\n|11.0|22.0|66.1\n|15.0|26.0|71.4\n|18.0|29.0|72.7\n|21.0|32.0|64.5\n|17.0|28.0|62.7\n|15.0|26.0|61.9\n|13.0|24.0|61.0\n|12.0|23.0|49.9\n|maxprecip = 72.7\n|float     = both\n|clear     = both\n|units     = SI\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]] climates. \n\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|20.0|22.0|48.9\n|19.0|21.0|50.1\n|18.0|20.0|52.5\n|18.0|20.0|56.4\n|20.0|22.0|66.1\n|24.0|26.0|71.4\n|27.0|29.0|72.7\n|30.0|32.0|64.5\n|26.0|28.0|62.7\n|24.0|26.0|61.9\n|22.0|24.0|61.0\n|21.0|23.0|49.9\n|maxprecip = 72.7\n|float     = both\n|clear     = both\n|units     = SI\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded \u20ac236&nbsp;billion (about US$316&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|year=2012|work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen|accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914010546/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest state (after the [[city-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. US$52,500.\n\nThe [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]].

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all three y axes on one plot to show the same data. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line.  Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the other two throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.
