Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. After the death of [[Attila]] in 454, they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]]. Their independent kingdom was however destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in the early 6th century AD. A part of this population subsequently became established inside the Roman empire near [[Belgrade]], and continued contributing fighting men to the [[Eastern Roman empire]], and participating in Balkan and Italian conflicts.\n\nWith their last kingdom eventually dominated by Rome, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities, the Heruli disappeared from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Heruli is sometimes spelled as Heruls, Herules, Herulians or Eruli.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=388}}\n\nThe name Heruli was often written in Greek and Latin with no \"h\", and is sometimes thought to be Germanic and related to the English word ''[[earl]]'' (see [[erilaz]]) implying that it was an honorific military title.{{sfn|Neumann|1999|p=468}} There is even speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=359-360}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Heruli are believed to have been [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking.<ref name=\"Heather_Germanic-speaking\">{{harvnb|Heather|2007|p=469}}. \"Heruli \u2013 Germanic-speaking group originally from north central Europe, some of whom migrated to regions north of the Black Sea in company with Goths and others in the third century.\"</ref> Personal names provide important evidence on the language of the Heruli.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|pp=468-469}} A large number of Heruli names are attested, and many of these are certainly [[Germanic name|Germanic]],<ref name=\"Maenchen-Helfen_837\">{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1947|pp=837-838}}. \"[[:de:Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld|Sch\u00f6nfeld]]... offers Germanic etymologies not only for Faras and Alvith but also for Fanotheus, Filimuth, Hariso, Sindval, Svartva, Uligangus, and Visandus.

Other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Rugii]] and the Goths, are believed to have carried out a similar migration at this time. These peoples replaced the [[Sarmatians]] as the dominant power north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by [[Dexippus]], whose writings were a source for later historians.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=58-60}}\n\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the [[Nestos (river)|river Nestos]] using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive [[imperial insignia]] from the Romans, gaining the rank of a [[Roman consul]]. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=324}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=62}}\n\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270.<ref>Also see {{harvtxt|Zahariade|2010}}.</ref> Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the [[Dnieper]], manned by a large force of various different Scythian peoples, including [[Peucini|Peuci]], [[Greutungi]], [[Ostrogoths|Austrogothi]], [[Tervingi]], [[Vesi]], [[Gepids]], [[Celts]], and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the [[Hellespont]]. One force attacked [[Thessaloniki]], and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the [[Crimea]]. Lesser attacks continued until 276.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the [[Chernyakhov culture]],{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}} which, although dominated the Goths and other Germanic peoples,<ref name=\"Heather_Chernyakhov\">{{harvnb|Heather|1994|p=87}}. \"[S]ome of the territory covered by the S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f\u2013\u010cernjachov culture may have been controlled not by Goths but by related Germanic peoples, such as the Heruli.\"</ref> also included [[Bastarnae]], [[Dacians]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=87}}\n\nJordanes reports that the Heruli in the late 4th century AD were conquered by [[Ermanaric]], king of the [[Greuthungi]]an Goths.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=77-80}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|331-333}}{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} Ermanaric's realm may also have included [[Baltic Finns|Finns]], [[Slavs]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were lead by their king Alaric.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} [[Herwig Wolfram]] has suggested that the future [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]] may have been named after this Herulian king.{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=33}}\n\n===The \"western\" Heruli, soldiers and pirates===\n\n[[File:Heruli seniores shield pattern.svg|right|thumb|The shield pattern of the ''[[Heruli seniores]]'', a [[Late Roman military]] unit composed of Heruli.]]\nThe proposal that there may have been a Western kingdom of Heruli has posed a problem for scholars. This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter. Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history. It is just easier and not too dangerous.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=330}}}}\nGiven the writing style of Sidonius this reference could also be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to third-century accounts of Herules attacking from the sea\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=329}}\n\n===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===\n[[File:Huns450.png|thumb|upright=1|Territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD]]\n\nIn the early 5th century AD, large groups of peoples left the [[Middle Danube]] region, including the groups who crossed the Rhine in 405, many of eventually reached Iberia, and also the forces of [[Radagaisus]] who invaded Italy. During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}}\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons and their Ostrogoth allies lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli on the winning side with the [[Gepids]] were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The losing Ostrogothic forces moved into the Balkans, under Byzantine influence.\n\nCompared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nThe Herulian kingdom, apparently under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. From this region they pushed westwards, on one occasion attacking [[Passau]], and eventually established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary. They do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the Balkans. [[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial [[foederati]] troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. By 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.520 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian 'kingdom']]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]].

Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]), or first to [[Bassianae]], and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=369}} This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=350-351}} Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their request was granted, and a new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s. [...] The crowning irony, in the historian's view, was that, because some Herules served as Roman ''foederati'', they both plundered Roman subjects and collected pay from the Roman emperor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=208}}</ref>}}\n\n==Cities sacked by the Heruli==\n*[[Athens]]\n*[[Byzantium]]\n*[[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]]\n*[[Lemnos]]\n*[[Skyros]]\n*[[Sparta]]\n*[[Corinth]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[J\u00e4rsberg Runestone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Ancient sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jordanes |author-link=Jordanes |translator-last1=Mierow |translator-first1=Charles C. |translator-link1=Charles Christopher Mierow |year=1908 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=The Origins and Deeds of the Goths |url=https://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Procopius |author-link=Procopius |translator-last1=Dewing |translator-first1=Henry Bronson |translator-link1= |year=1914 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=History of the Wars |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Modern sources==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Angelov |first1=Alexander |author-link1= |date=2018 |year= |orig-year= |chapter=Heruli |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-2225 |editor1-last=Nicholson |editor1-first=Oliver |editor1-link= |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A09WDwAAQBAJ |url-status= |format= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=678 |pages= |doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001 |isbn=9780191744457 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=January 25, 2020 |via= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bremmer |first=Jan |author-link=Jan N.

Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. After the death of [[Attila]] in 454, they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]]. Their independent kingdom was however destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in the early 6th century AD. A part of this population subsequently became established inside the Roman empire near [[Belgrade]], and continued contributing fighting men to the [[Eastern Roman empire]], and participating in Balkan and Italian conflicts.\n\nWith their last kingdom eventually dominated by Rome, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities, the Heruli disappeared from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Heruli is sometimes spelled as Heruls, Herules, Herulians or Eruli.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=388}}\n\nThe name Heruli was often written in Greek and Latin with no \"h\", and is sometimes thought to be Germanic and related to the English word ''[[earl]]'' (see [[erilaz]]) implying that it was an honorific military title.{{sfn|Neumann|1999|p=468}} There is even speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=359-360}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Heruli are believed to have been [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking.<ref name=\"Heather_Germanic-speaking\">{{harvnb|Heather|2007|p=469}}. \"Heruli \u2013 Germanic-speaking group originally from north central Europe, some of whom migrated to regions north of the Black Sea in company with Goths and others in the third century.\"</ref> Personal names provide important evidence on the language of the Heruli.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|pp=468-469}} A large number of Heruli names are attested, and many of these are certainly [[Germanic name|Germanic]],<ref name=\"Maenchen-Helfen_837\">{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1947|pp=837-838}}. \"[[:de:Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld|Sch\u00f6nfeld]]... offers Germanic etymologies not only for Faras and Alvith but also for Fanotheus, Filimuth, Hariso, Sindval, Svartva, Uligangus, and Visandus.

Other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Rugii]] and the Goths, are believed to have carried out a similar migration at this time. These peoples replaced the [[Sarmatians]] as the dominant power north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by [[Dexippus]], whose writings were a source for later historians.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=58-60}}\n\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the [[Nestos (river)|river Nestos]] using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive [[imperial insignia]] from the Romans, gaining the rank of a [[Roman consul]]. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=324}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=62}}\n\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270.<ref>Also see {{harvtxt|Zahariade|2010}}.</ref> Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the [[Dnieper]], manned by a large force of various different Scythian peoples, including [[Peucini|Peuci]], [[Greutungi]], [[Ostrogoths|Austrogothi]], [[Tervingi]], [[Vesi]], [[Gepids]], [[Celts]], and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the [[Hellespont]]. One force attacked [[Thessaloniki]], and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the [[Crimea]]. Lesser attacks continued until 276.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the [[Chernyakhov culture]],{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}} which, although dominated the Goths and other Germanic peoples,<ref name=\"Heather_Chernyakhov\">{{harvnb|Heather|1994|p=87}}. \"[S]ome of the territory covered by the S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f\u2013\u010cernjachov culture may have been controlled not by Goths but by related Germanic peoples, such as the Heruli.\"</ref> also included [[Bastarnae]], [[Dacians]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=87}}\n\nJordanes reports that the Heruli in the late 4th century AD were conquered by [[Ermanaric]], king of the [[Greuthungi]]an Goths.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=77-80}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|331-333}}{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} Ermanaric's realm may also have included [[Baltic Finns|Finns]], [[Slavs]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were lead by their king Alaric.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} [[Herwig Wolfram]] has suggested that the future [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]] may have been named after this Herulian king.{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=33}}\n\n===The \"western\" Heruli, soldiers and pirates===\n\n[[File:Heruli seniores shield pattern.svg|right|thumb|The shield pattern of the ''[[Heruli seniores]]'', a [[Late Roman military]] unit composed of Heruli.]]\nThe proposal that there may have been a Western kingdom of Heruli has posed a problem for scholars. This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter (.}} Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history. It is just easier and not too dangerous.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=330}}}}\nGiven the writing style of Sidonius this reference could also be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to third-century accounts of Herules attacking from the sea\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=329}}\n\n===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===\n[[File:Huns450.png|thumb|upright=1|Territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD]]\n\nIn the early 5th century AD, large groups of peoples left the [[Middle Danube]] region, including the groups who crossed the Rhine in 405, many of eventually reached Iberia, and also the forces of [[Radagaisus]] who invaded Italy. During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}}\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons and their Ostrogoth allies lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli on the winning side with the [[Gepids]] were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The losing Ostrogothic forces moved into the Balkans, under Byzantine influence.\n\nCompared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nThe Herulian kingdom, apparently under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. From this region they pushed westwards, on one occasion attacking [[Passau]], and eventually established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary. They do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the Balkans. [[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial [[foederati]] troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. By 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.520 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian 'kingdom']]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]]. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=366}}\n\n===Later history===\nAfter the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to [[Procopius]], in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in [[Thule]], which for Procopius meant Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}} Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the [[Slavs]], then empty lands, and then the lands of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], until finally settling down nearby the [[Geats]].{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=430}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XV|Book VI, XV]]</ref> Peter Heather considers this account to be \"entirely plausible\" although he notes that others have labelled it a \"fairy story\", and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}} \n\nAnother Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by [[Theoderic the Great]] in [[Pavia]] in north Italy.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=144}}\n\nWhat happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488. Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=350}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=144-145}} \n\n[[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius Caesar]] allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]), or first to [[Bassianae]], and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=369}} This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=350-351}} Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their request was granted, and a new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s.

The second aim of the [[French Foreign Legion]] was to recruiting foreign nationals into the [[France|French]] military service. The Foreign Legion was deeply involved in the [[French conquest of Algeria]] of 1830-1849 and France's colonial expansion. \n\n== Foreign nationals in service of France==\n=== Ancien R\u00e9gime ===\nThe [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] had hired foreign soldiers since before the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crowdy|first=Terry|title=French Revolutionary Infantry 1789-1802|publisher=|year=|isbn=1-84176-660-7|location=|pages=13 and 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1346, [[Philip VI of France]] deployed 15,000 Genovese at the [[Battle of Crecy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The 13th century and the 14th century also witnessed [[free company|grand companies of Scots]], Castillans, Savoyards, Swiss, and Dutch soldiers of given chiefs or princes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], the French Army consisted of 20%-30% non-French soldiers. Additionally, Louis XI employed a [[Garde Ecossaise]](Scottish Guard), and up to 6000 Swiss guards in 1480.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=11}}\n\n[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] created the {{ill|Foreign Regiments of the Ancien R\u00e9gime|fr|R\u00e9giments \u00e9trangers au service de l'Ancien R\u00e9gime}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}, formed of mostly foreign infantry corps. \n \n[[Image:Jean Duplessi-Bertaux 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[10 August (French Revolution)|Day of August 10, 1792]] ''La Prise des Tuileries'' (The taking of the Tuileries).

The National Legislative Assembly stated in its its July 26, 1792 decree that \"if the ennemies kingdoms would deploy numerous armies against the free people, it is important for these free people to admit into their ranks all the men whose sublime impulse calls to fight for the sacred cause of Liberty.\" Accordingly, the ''L\u00e9gion Franche Etrang\u00e8re'' was created on August 1, 1792. A [[Germanic Legion]], an {{ill|Italian Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion Italique}}, a [[Batavian Legion]], and a [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legion]] were also formed.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=12}}.

In Spain, one-sixth of them were foreign soldiers.{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}\n \nAfter his rise to power, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] recruited 4,000 Swiss{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=12}} and then more than 90,000 in the course of his reign.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} They formed the {{ill|Valaison Battalion|fr|bataillon Valaisan}}, in 1805.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1805, Russian and Austrian prisoners composed the {{ill|Regiment of Tour d'Auvergne|fr|R\u00e9giment de La Tour d'Auvergne}} and the {{ill|Regiment of Isembourg|fr|R\u00e9giment d'Isembourg}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The two were later renamed: 1st Foreign Regiment and 2nd \nForeign Regiment{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} and later dissolved in 1814.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe {{ill|Piedmontese Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion Pi\u00e9montaise}} or ''L\u00e9gion du Midi'', created in 1803, was composed of former French soldiers and recruits from the [[Departments of France#Departments of the Napoleonic Empire in Europe|French departments of Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Napoleon's forces would also include the Spanish Pioneers, the {{ill|Catalonian Regiment|fr|R\u00e9giment de Catalogne}}, the {{ill|Hanoverian Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion hanovrienne}}, the Egyptian [[Mamluks]], and the [[Portuguese Legion (Napoleonic Wars)|Portuguese Legion]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBetween 1806 and 1814, 60 foreign units were constituted and commanded by 136 generals.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=12}} A large part of these Europeans were volunteers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Conscripts came only from the regions annexed by the Empire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n \nIt is estimated that of the 400,000 men who crossed the [[Neman]] River towards [[Moscow]] or [[Smolensk]], just 120,000 were actually French.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=12}} During the [[Hundred Days]], Napoleons assembled eight foreign regiments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Restoration ===\nUnder [[Louis XVIII of France]], 14,000 Swiss soldiers in six regiments and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in four regiments and Spanish, constituted the Royal Foreign Legion in 1815.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=12}}\n\n== Creation of the French Foreign Legion ==\n=== Causes ===\nThe creation of the Foreign Legion was in large part was due to the aftermath following the [[July Revolution]].{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=9}}\n\nFollowing the purge of the army after the [[July Revolution]],{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=9}} Louis Philippe I was in need of a way to occupy those seen as dangerous or restless elements of the regular army, whether French or foreign. The Legion became a depository for those who did not conform to the governing agenda. There was also concern over those seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had journeyed in the hopes of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} To the State, they threatened the stability of the kingdom and its economy it became urgent to the group and distance them.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the men in the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}} and the war, deemed very unpopular. Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

The Foreign Legion was deeply involved in the [[French conquest of Algeria]] of 1830-1849 and France's colonial expansion.

Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

This Legion will be known as the French Foreign Legion.\nArt. 2 - The battalions of the French Foreign Legion will have the same formation as the line infantry battalions.\nArt. 3 - For pay, masses and administration, the French Foreign Legion will be assimilated to French regiments.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.
