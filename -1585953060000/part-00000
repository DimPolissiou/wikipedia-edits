He was the son of Richard Howard, a farmer, and Ann Howard, n\u00e9e Kilvert. He was educated at Wrekin College, Royal College of Science, South Kensington, and as Foundation Scholar, at St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1896, he graduated in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, where he also obtained a Diploma of Agriculture in 1897. In 1899, he lectured in Agricultural Science at Harrison College, Barbados, and in 1899 and 1902, was a Mycologist and Agricultural Lecturer at the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies. From 1903\u20131905, he was Botanist to the South-Eastern Agricultural College, Wye; and from 1905\u20131924, he was Imperial Economic Botanist to the Government of India. In 1914, he was created a Companion of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.), and received a Silver Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1920. From 1924\u20131931, Howard was Director of the Institute of Plant Industry, Indore, and Agricultural Adviser to States in Central India and Rajputana. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1928, and in 1930 received the Barclay Memorial Medal of that society. He was knighted in 1934, and made an Honourable Fellow of the Imperial College of Science in 1935.<ref name=LEHoward1953>{{citation |year=1953 |author=Howard, Louise E |title=Sir Albert Howard in India |place=London |publisher= Faber & Faber |url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/HI/HItoc.html |accessdate=10 August 2010}} [http://ps-survival.com/PS/Crops/On_Food_Crops_Sir_Albert_Howard_In_India_1910.pdf pdf version]</ref><ref name=LondonGazette4223>{{citation |date=3 July 1934 |title=Notification of Knighthood conferred 30 June 1934 |journal=[[London Gazette|The London Gazette]]|issue=34066|page=4223 |url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34066/pages/4223 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nHoward worked in [[India]] as agricultural adviser<ref>Rebecca Jones, ''Green Harvest: The History of Organic Farming and Gardening in Australia'', Collingwood, Victoria: Csiro Publishing, 2010, p. 3</ref> and was in charge of a government research farm at [[Indore]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Solomon| first = Steve| title = Sir Albert Howard's Indore Method| work = Organic Gardener's Composting| publisher = Soil And Health Library| url = http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030202/03020209.html | accessdate =20 June 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524044950/http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030202/03020209.html| archivedate= 24 May 2008 | url-status= live}}\n</ref> He worked together with [[Gabrielle Howard|Gabrielle Matthaei]] (1876\u20131930), and her sister [[Louise Howard|Louise]] (1880\u20131969).

Though he journeyed to India to teach Western agricultural techniques he found that the Indians could in fact teach him more. One important aspect he took notice of was the connection between healthy soil and the villages' healthy populations, livestock and crop. Patrick Holden, Director of the UK [[Soil Association]] quoted Howard as saying \"the health of soil, plant, animal and man is one and indivisible.\" He was president of the 13th session of the [[Indian Science Congress Association#Indian Science Congress|Indian Science Congress]] in 1926.\n\nHoward has been called the father of modern composting, for his refinement of a traditional Indian composting system into what is now known as the [[Container composting|Indore method]]. He went on to document and develop organic farming techniques, and spread his knowledge through the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Soil Association]], and the [[Rodale Institute]] in the [[United States|US]]. His 1940 [[book]], ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', is a classic organic farming text. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining [[humus]], keeping water in the soil, and the role of [[mycorrhiza]]. It was his first book aimed at the general public, and is his best popularly known work.

The error is an artifact of the manner in which Howard's name has passed into contemporary public knowledge, via his two most famous books ''An Agricultural Testament'' (first published 1940), and ''Soil and Health'' (first published 1945 under a different title, but known mostly by this 1947 title), by which time he was referred to as \"Sir\".

He was educated at Wrekin College, Royal College of Science, South Kensington, and as Foundation Scholar, at St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1896, he graduated in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, where he also obtained a Diploma of Agriculture in 1897. In 1899, he lectured in Agricultural Science at Harrison College, Barbados, and in 1899 and 1902, was a Mycologist and Agricultural Lecturer at the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies. From 1903\u20131905, he was Botanist to the South-Eastern Agricultural College, Wye; and from 1905\u20131924, he was Imperial Economic Botanist to the Government of India. In 1914, he was created a Companion of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.), and received a Silver Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1920. From 1924\u20131931, Howard was Director of the Institute of Plant Industry, Indore, and Agricultural Adviser to States in Central India and Rajputana. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1928, and in 1930 received the Barclay Memorial Medal of that society.

Though he journeyed to India to teach Western agricultural techniques he found that the Indians could in fact teach him more. One important aspect he took notice of was the connection between healthy soil and the villages' healthy populations, livestock and crop. Patrick Holden, Director of the UK [[Soil Association]] quoted Howard as saying \"the health of soil, plant, animal and man is one and indivisible.\" He was president of the 13th session of the [[Indian Science Congress Association#Indian Science Congress|Indian Science Congress]] in 1926.\n\nHoward has been called the father of modern composting, for his refinement of a traditional Indian composting system into what is now known as the [[Container composting|Indore method]]. He went on to document and develop organic farming techniques, and spread his knowledge through the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Soil Association]], and the [[Rodale Institute]] in the [[United States|US]]. His 1940 [[book]], ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', is a classic organic farming text. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining [[humus]], keeping water in the soil, and the role of [[mycorrhiza]]. It was his first book aimed at the general public, and is his best popularly known work. However his 1931 book ''The Waste Products of Agriculture'', based on 26 years of studying improved crop production in Indian smallholdings, is considered by some as his most important scientific publication.<ref name=Stinner2007/> His 1945 book ''Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease'' was also intended for a general audience, and was republished in 1947 as ''The Soil and Health: A Study of Organic Agriculture''.<ref name=Stinner2007/> Howard's work influenced and inspired many farmers and agricultural scientists who furthered the organic movement, including [[Lady Eve Balfour]] (the [[Haughley Experiment]], ''[[The Living Soil]]'') and [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I.

However, this is an error. He was not knighted until 1934, and would not have been referred to as Sir. The error is an artifact of the manner in which Howard's name has passed into contemporary public knowledge, via his two most famous books ''An Agricultural Testament'' (first published 1940), and ''Soil and Health'' (first published 1945 under a different title, but known mostly by this 1947 title), by which time he was referred to as \"Sir\". Indeed, prior to the advent of the internet and the related information explosion, these were the only two works popularly known by all but the most dedicated researchers, with even less known about his life history, beyond brief synopses associated with the books, and replicated in various book descriptions.<ref name=OutofPrintbookdescription>{{citation|title=Out of print description of An Agricultural Testament |series=description is verbatim from rear of dust-cover |publisher=Cumberland Books website |url=http://www.cumberlandbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=259 |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180652/http://cumberlandbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=259 |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}</ref>\n{{refend}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Organic farming]]\n*[[Biodynamic agriculture]]\n*[[Compost]]\n*[[List of sustainable agriculture topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard.html The Works of Sir Albert Howard].
