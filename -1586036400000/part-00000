An anime adaptation by [[A-1 Pictures]] from July 5, 2013 to September 26, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around the daily lives of employees in a government office building in the fictional city of Mitsuba, [[Hokkaido]]. Lucy's parents had a very hard time picking a single name for her when she was born. Because of their indecisiveness, they decided to give her over a dozen different names, and this was legally approved by a civil servant no less. At an adult age, Lucy manages to land a job at the same public service office. But her reason is to seek revenge against the person who had legalized her ridiculously long name. Being a civil servant is not an easy job due to dealing with many angry citizens, facing different challenges, and having to put up with wacky co-workers each day. However, Lucy is determined to do whatever it will take to get her revenge. Newcomers Hasebe Yutaka, Yamagami, Miyoshi Saya, and their supervisor Ichimiya Taishi go through the everyday quirks of working at their office.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Lucy (...) Yamagami|\u5c71\u795e \u30eb\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc\uff08\u7565\uff09|Yamagami R\u016bsh\u012b (ryaku)}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ai Kayano]]}}\n:Lucy is a newcomer who decides to apply as a public servant to look for and take revenge on the man (himself a public servant) responsible for approving her rather long name given to her by her parents. She shows seriousness in her work, but is always the target of Yutaka's pranks. Her real name, or least part of the name she could mention, is '''Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho Chihoko Ayano Fumika Chitose Sanae Mikiko Ichika Yukino Reina Eri ... (still continues)'''.\n: She has a [[cowlick]] (ahoge) sticking up on her head\u2014a trait inherited from her mother, according to the flashback in the first episode\u2014which reacts according to her mood or emotions. Out of all the three new employees, she seems to be the most na\u00efve and low guarded. She dislikes Hasebe at first because of his constant teasing of her, but throughout the story, she has somewhat noticed his feelings towards her. In the final episode, when Hasebe asked her out, she says \"not yet\", which implies that she is now more conscious of him and may have developed feelings towards him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Hasebe|\u9577\u8c37\u90e8 \u8c4a|Hasebe Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]]}}\n:The only male among the three newcomers, who is notorious for goofing off at work, asking for the email addresses of any girl he meets which he never uses to contact them, and teasing Lucy. Despite his easy-going slacker image, he in fact shows some talent in his line of duty in the least expected situations, like in episode 3, when he is seen to be able to do ventriloquism and use sign language. At home he is not as hyper as he is in the office due to always tiring himself out playing computer games. He has a sister named Kaoru, who is also a civil servant, and is even more rambunctious than Hasebe is. Among his family he is actually the least hyper. He seems to have feelings for Lucy and has asked her out twice, only to be \"shot down\" both times. It was unclear whether he was serious in the beginning but, in episode 8, it is confirmed that Hasebe has feelings for Lucy when he says to her \"I was pretty serious all this time, but at this rate, I'll really fall deep in love with you\". In episode 12, Hasebe and Lucy have their first date but is unable to finish it due to Hasebe's family circumstances. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Hasebe's father is the public servant who approved Lucy's long name.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Saya Miyoshi|\u4e09\u597d \u7d17\u8036|Miyoshi Saya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}\n:A 24-year-old college graduate and a soft-spoken girl who tends to keep her opinions of other people to herself. She was first assigned as one of many front desk officers, and spends most of her time listening to the never-ending rants of their older customers, especially the elderly Mrs. Tanaka. She develops an awkward relationship with Mrs. Tanaka's grandson J\u014dji, whom she feels infiltrated by his habit of carrying her for nonsense, though she has developed a better feeling to him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Megumi Chihaya|\u5343\u65e9 \u6075|Chihaya Megumi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}\n:A social service employee who is actually working as a temporary employee with a shorter shift than others. She is rather aloof towards her co-workers, and is revealed to be an avid fan of the magical girl series ''Magical Flowers''. When she is not at work, she attends [[cosplay]] events dressed as Gerbera Pink, one of the characters of the series. She openly desires to see Lucy cosplay as one of the other characters from \"Magical Flowers\" due to her dark hair and large bust. She hates Hasebe getting too close to Lucy in case he convinces her to cosplay before she does. She has been dating Ichimiya for over a year, and has tried to make it clear to him that she doesn't care if he prioritizes Tohko on Christmas because of comiket.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Taishi Ichimiya|\u4e00\u5bae \u5927\u5fd7|Ichimiya Taishi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takahiro Sakurai]]}}\n:Taishi is a supervisor in the health and welfare office and the one in charge of Lucy and her friends. Although kind and approachable, Taishi is prone to be bossed around, particularly by his sister. He has been dating Chihaya for over a year, but worries about getting dumped before Christmas, since Toko's birthday is on the same day and he always prioritizes Toko, though Chihaya, due to her own Christmas cosplay commitments, doesn't seem to care.\n\n;{{Nihongo|T\u014dhko Ichimiya|\u4e00\u5bae \u5854\u5b50|Ichimiya T\u014dko}} \n:{{voiced by|[[Rumi \u014ckubo]]}}\n:Taishi's [[tsundere]] younger sister, noted for having a peculiar marking under her right eye similar to the \"bulging vein\" image used to depict a person when angry. Staying true to this quirky trait, T\u014dhko is often in a bad mood and has a short temper. On the other hand, she seems to have a brother complex. Ever since learning about her older brother's interest in working as a public servant, T\u014dhko started learning more about the job, and by high school is knowledgeable enough to give surprise quizzes to employees every time she visits her brother's workplace.

Yutaka is very relaxed to the point of slacking off every chance he gets, while Saya is very nervous because this is her first job. Lucy is introduced to Megumi Chihaya, who is a very low-key and emotionless person. After the first few hours or so, the three newbies meet up again and share their disappointments. Saya was caught up in a long story with Mrs. Tanaka, unable to escape; Lucy was scolded by a customer for taking too long in directing her to the right window; Yutaka was disheartened to discover that he couldn't slack off as frequently as he would've liked. Later however, Lucy is shown making great progress, much to Saya's admiration. Afterwards, Yutaka, Taishi, and Saya find out that she's a modern day [[Jugemu]] (a great source of embarrassment for her), due to her parents not being able to decide on one first name. Lucy reveals that the real reason she joined the civil service was to get revenge on the civil servant who carelessly allowed her birth certificate to pass without raising a single question about her name. Hasebe begins calling her by the first part of her name, to Lucy's great displeasure. After rescuing Lucy twice from some customers, her opinion of him changes, until he begins to make fun of her name again. Taishi and Saya later comment that although Lucy holds a grudge against the civil service, she's actually suited for the job.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Don't Panic, Make a Scene, or Throw Away Your Job\n| AltTitle        = Oshigoto wa Awatezu Sawagazu Nagedasazu\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306f \u614c\u3066\u305a\u9a12\u304c\u305a \u6295\u3052\u51fa\u3055\u305a}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|7|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = Lucy sees Saya hiding under her desk and discovers that she was trying to stay out of Mrs. Tanaka's sight to avoid listening to more stories, but consequently, as Yutaka points out, she can't do her work. Saya is ashamed because she's unable to work, so Lucy goes to Megumi for advice, who tells her that she will think on it. Megumi asks Lucy to cover for her the next day, and it is revealed that she is going to attend a cosplay event. Megumi tells Lucy that she became a temporary worker so that she would be able to continue to cosplay while working. She later becomes obsessed with trying to get Lucy to cosplay as Black Rose, a companion of Megumi's character, Gerbera Pink, and Lucy reluctantly agrees to think about it. Later, T\u014dko (a high school girl) comes to visit the office and gives Yutaka, Saya, and Lucy a test to see if they can do their new jobs properly. Yutaka demonstrates his surprisingly amazing memory by reciting a nurse insurance law, receiving T\u014dko's e-mail address as a reward. Saya's nervousness causes T\u014dko to become angry, and Mrs. Tanaka comes to the rescue by scolding her harshly. T\u014dko is relieved to see that Lucy is normal, until she asks Lucy her name, to which Lucy recites her entire name. T\u014dko, fed up with the newbies, complains to Taishi, who tells her that she's bothering everyone around her. She begins crying, so he hugs her and gives her money to placate her before sending her home. Saya then discovers that T\u014dko's full name is T\u014dko Ichimiya, thus making her Taishi's little sister. Taishi shares the story about how T\u014dko came to love the ward office, but it is clear that what T\u014dko adores is her brother, not the office. Afterwards, Megumi sees that Saya has a hard time saying what's on her mind, so she enlists T\u014dko's help in getting Saya to talk openly. Saya tells T\u014dko that if she continues to abuse her brother, he will never understand her true feelings, causing T\u014dko to cry again. Taishi tells her not to come back because she keeps bothering others, but Saya saves her by asking her to come back to help her learn more, though this causes Saya to lose even more time for working.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Don't Neglect the Safety of You or Your Workplace\n| AltTitle        = Okotaru na Shokuba no Anzen Mi no Anzen\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u6020\u308b\u306a \u8077\u5834\u306e\u5b89\u5168 \u8eab\u306e\u5b89\u5168}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|7|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = Megumi rebukes Taishi for questioning her on whether he is a reliable senpai before giving her an assessment of Lucy.

After giving Lucy a hard time, T\u014dko delivers Taishi's bento she especially made for him as an excuse to have lunch with him. In the records room, Lucy breaks her bra forcing her to wear the office uniform. As she interacts with Saya, Megumi, Taishi, and Yutaka they all come to notice that something is wrong with her bra. At lunch the four contemplate how to address Lucy's predicament with her however Yutaka takes the initiative and realizing his intentions, the other three agree forcing her to go home. The next day, Yutaka talks with Taishi about not being able to get Lucy's email address as he attempts to do so. Seeing her leaving though, he follows her and invites her out to lunch while at a bookstore where she reveals that she usually doesn't have money before payday as she buys too many books. Even after dinner, he forgets to ask for her email address. In the supply room, Yutaka and Taishi hear out Lucy's insecurities about her abilities and name. Later as she is having trouble with a child, Yutaka arrives to entertain the girl as Lucy realizes he is able to use ventriloquism. Yutaka meets Lucy a few times while it is raining and discovers that she is afraid of lightning and thunder. He helps Lucy but has some fun as he tells Megumi that Lucy was busy for so long due to filling out the name section on documents. Lucy oversees Yutaka using sign language and ends up questioning him about himself. As they're talking, Lucy agrees to learn sign language but not before she repays the previous favor which ends up being settled by her telling Yutaka her cup size. A shocked Yutaka starts counting to verify her size as Lucy yells at him to stop before running off.

Megumi is lurking in the shadows ready to intervene if something goes wrong, while trying to tell Toko, who is with her, about her relationship with her brother. There she finds out that Toko doesn't mind if her brother has a girlfriend. The next day Yutaka does his work without slacking off, though with some mistakes. Taishi, Saya, and Megumi notices this and finds it worrisome, and, asking him, they find out the (shocking) reason: that the one who approved Lucy's name was his own father.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = Now We're Set, A Fun Workplace Leading to Tomorrow\n| AltTitle        = Korede Yoshi Ashita ni Tsunagu Tanoshii Shokuba\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u3053\u308c\u3067\u826f\u3057 \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u3064\u306a\u3050 \u697d\u3057\u3044\u8077\u5834}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Taishi, Saya, and Megumi found the reason of Yutaka's weird behavior, they also knew another reason why Yutaka avoided Lucy. It was because at the day Lucy's name was brought to the ward office, Yutaka was down in a high fever until he was taken into a hospital. His father became so worried about him and thus couldn't concentrate in his work, which was why he accidentally approved Lucy's name without even thinking about it any further. Depressed by the truth that he was the indirect reason why Lucy had a long name, Yutaka was afraid that Lucy would hate him since she was so concerned about her name. The three tried to cheer him up, but in the end they only made it worse. When Lucy came into the room, they quickly changed the subject, and Lucy saw Yutaka's dejected and sad face towards her. Because of this, she became concerned that maybe she had done something bad to Yutaka. One day when Lucy was about to go home, Taishi went to Yutaka and cheered him up, by saying that it will be harder to say the truth the longer he holds it in. Cheered up by Taishi's words, Yutaka chased after Lucy and finally told the truth to her. However, Lucy didn't think that Yutaka was at fault since anyone could catch a fever. Because of Yutaka's insistence, Lucy assumed that if everything was Yutaka's fault, he had to take responsibility. She asked him to keep calling her by her first name because she began to like him calling her Lucy all the time. Just when Yutaka was about to confess to her, Joji, Kanon, Toko, and Kenzo suddenly came in, ruining the mood. The three who was listening all the time shoved all of them away, and the mood became awkward once again. When the two of them were outside, Yutaka once again tried to ask Lucy out. The latter only rejected, but gave him a hope by saying, \"Not yet\". The others quickly caught up to the two and started to ruin the mood again. The next day, Taishi tried to tell Toko about his relationship with Megumi, only to fail since he was nervous. Yutaka became so energetic and enthusiastic in his work. Saya reprimanded Joji for ruining Lucy's and Yutaka's moments. As the two's mood were getting better, all of them were back to their jobs. After the ending credits, Yutaka finally got Lucy's email address and Megumi told them to explode.\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.servantservice.org/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|manga|15240}}\n\n{{A-1 Pictures}}\n{{Gangan Comics manga franchises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Servant x Service}}\n[[Category:A-1 Pictures]]\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:Anime set in Hokkaido]]\n[[Category:Aniplex]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Gangan Comics manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Slice of life anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Square Enix franchises]]\n[[Category:Tokyo MX shows]]\n[[Category:Yen Press titles]]\n[[Category:Yonkoma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name = Servant \u00d7 Service\n| image = Servant x Service Manga Cover Volume 1.jpg\n| caption = Cover of the first manga volume featuring main character Lucy Yamagami.\n| ja_kanji = \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30c8\u00d7\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9     \n| ja_romaji = S\u0101banto \u00d7 S\u0101bisu\n| genre = [[Comedy]], [[Slice of Life]], [[Romance (love)|Romance]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type = manga\n| title =\n| author = [[Karino Takatsu]]\n| illustrator =\n| publisher = [[Square Enix]]\n| publisher_en = {{English manga publisher\n | NA  = [[Yen Press]]\n}}\n| demographic = [[Seinen manga|Seinen]]\n| magazine = Big Gangan \n| first = June 29, 2007 \n| last = June 25, 2014\n| volumes = 4\n| volume_list = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = tv series\n| director        = [[Yasutaka Yamamoto]]\n| producer        = Takamitsu Inoue<br/>Masayuki Nishide\n| writer          = Kento Shimoyama\n| music           = Monaca\n| studio          = [[A-1 Pictures]]\n| licensee        = {{English anime licensee\n | NA = [[Aniplex of America]]\n}}\n| network         = [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Tokyo MX]], Tochigi TV, Gunma TV, Hokkaido Broadcasting Company, Chukyo TV, [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]], [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]]\n| network_en      = {{English anime network\n |PH = [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]]\n\n}}\n| first           =  July 5, 2013\n| last            =  September 26, 2013\n| episodes        =  13\n| episode_list    = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n{{Nihongo|'''''Servant \u00d7 Service'''''|\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30c8\u00d7\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9|S\u0101banto \u00d7 S\u0101bisu}} is a Japanese [[manga]] written and illustrated by [[Karino Takatsu]]. An anime adaptation by [[A-1 Pictures]] from July 5, 2013 to September 26, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around the daily lives of employees in a government office building in the fictional city of Mitsuba, [[Hokkaido]]. Lucy's parents had a very hard time picking a single name for her when she was born. Because of their indecisiveness, they decided to give her over a dozen different names, and this was legally approved by a civil servant no less. At an adult age, Lucy manages to land a job at the same public service office. But her reason is to seek revenge against the person who had legalized her ridiculously long name. Being a civil servant is not an easy job due to dealing with many angry citizens, facing different challenges, and having to put up with wacky co-workers each day. However, Lucy is determined to do whatever it will take to get her revenge. Newcomers Hasebe Yutaka, Yamagami, Miyoshi Saya, and their supervisor Ichimiya Taishi go through the everyday quirks of working at their office.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Lucy (...)

She shows seriousness in her work, but is always the target of Yutaka's pranks. Her real name, or least part of the name she could mention, is '''Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho Chihoko Ayano Fumika Chitose Sanae Mikiko Ichika Yukino Reina Eri ... (still continues)'''.\n: She has a [[cowlick]] (ahoge) sticking up on her head\u2014a trait inherited from her mother, according to the flashback in the first episode\u2014which reacts according to her mood or emotions. Out of all the three new employees, she seems to be the most na\u00efve and low guarded. She dislikes Hasebe at first because of his constant teasing of her, but throughout the story, she has somewhat noticed his feelings towards her. In the final episode, when Hasebe asked her out, she says \"not yet\", which implies that she is now more conscious of him and may have developed feelings towards him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Hasebe|\u9577\u8c37\u90e8 \u8c4a|Hasebe Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]]}}\n:The only male among the three newcomers, who is notorious for goofing off at work, asking for the email addresses of any girl he meets which he never uses to contact them, and teasing Lucy. Despite his easy-going slacker image, he in fact shows some talent in his line of duty in the least expected situations, like in episode 3, when he is seen to be able to do ventriloquism and use sign language. At home he is not as hyper as he is in the office due to always tiring himself out playing computer games. He has a sister named Kaoru, who is also a civil servant, and is even more rambunctious than Hasebe is. Among his family he is actually the least hyper. He seems to have feelings for Lucy and has asked her out twice, only to be \"shot down\" both times. It was unclear whether he was serious in the beginning but, in episode 8, it is confirmed that Hasebe has feelings for Lucy when he says to her \"I was pretty serious all this time, but at this rate, I'll really fall deep in love with you\". In episode 12, Hasebe and Lucy have their first date but is unable to finish it due to Hasebe's family circumstances. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Hasebe's father is the public servant who approved Lucy's long name.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Saya Miyoshi|\u4e09\u597d \u7d17\u8036|Miyoshi Saya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}\n:A 24-year-old college graduate and a soft-spoken girl who tends to keep her opinions of other people to herself.

She develops an awkward relationship with Mrs. Tanaka's grandson J\u014dji, whom she feels infiltrated by his habit of carrying her for nonsense, though she has developed a better feeling to him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Megumi Chihaya|\u5343\u65e9 \u6075|Chihaya Megumi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}\n:A social service employee who is actually working as a temporary employee with a shorter shift than others. She is rather aloof towards her co-workers, and is revealed to be an avid fan of the magical girl series ''Magical Flowers''. When she is not at work, she attends [[cosplay]] events dressed as Gerbera Pink, one of the characters of the series. She openly desires to see Lucy cosplay as one of the other characters from \"Magical Flowers\" due to her dark hair and large bust. She hates Hasebe getting too close to Lucy in case he convinces her to cosplay before she does. She has been dating Ichimiya for over a year, and has tried to make it clear to him that she doesn't care if he prioritizes Tohko on Christmas because of comiket.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Taishi Ichimiya|\u4e00\u5bae \u5927\u5fd7|Ichimiya Taishi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takahiro Sakurai]]}}\n:Taishi is a supervisor in the health and welfare office and the one in charge of Lucy and her friends.

Staying true to this quirky trait, T\u014dhko is often in a bad mood and has a short temper. On the other hand, she seems to have a brother complex. Ever since learning about her older brother's interest in working as a public servant, T\u014dhko started learning more about the job, and by high school is knowledgeable enough to give surprise quizzes to employees every time she visits her brother's workplace.

Lucy is introduced to Megumi Chihaya, who is a very low-key and emotionless person. After the first few hours or so, the three newbies meet up again and share their disappointments. Saya was caught up in a long story with Mrs. Tanaka, unable to escape; Lucy was scolded by a customer for taking too long in directing her to the right window; Yutaka was disheartened to discover that he couldn't slack off as frequently as he would've liked. Later however, Lucy is shown making great progress, much to Saya's admiration. Afterwards, Yutaka, Taishi, and Saya find out that she's a modern day [[Jugemu]] (a great source of embarrassment for her), due to her parents not being able to decide on one first name. Lucy reveals that the real reason she joined the civil service was to get revenge on the civil servant who carelessly allowed her birth certificate to pass without raising a single question about her name. Hasebe begins calling her by the first part of her name, to Lucy's great displeasure. After rescuing Lucy twice from some customers, her opinion of him changes, until he begins to make fun of her name again. Taishi and Saya later comment that although Lucy holds a grudge against the civil service, she's actually suited for the job.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Don't Panic, Make a Scene, or Throw Away Your Job\n| AltTitle        = Oshigoto wa Awatezu Sawagazu Nagedasazu\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306f \u614c\u3066\u305a\u9a12\u304c\u305a \u6295\u3052\u51fa\u3055\u305a}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|7|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = Lucy sees Saya hiding under her desk and discovers that she was trying to stay out of Mrs. Tanaka's sight to avoid listening to more stories, but consequently, as Yutaka points out, she can't do her work. Saya is ashamed because she's unable to work, so Lucy goes to Megumi for advice, who tells her that she will think on it. Megumi asks Lucy to cover for her the next day, and it is revealed that she is going to attend a cosplay event. Megumi tells Lucy that she became a temporary worker so that she would be able to continue to cosplay while working. She later becomes obsessed with trying to get Lucy to cosplay as Black Rose, a companion of Megumi's character, Gerbera Pink, and Lucy reluctantly agrees to think about it. Later, T\u014dko (a high school girl) comes to visit the office and gives Yutaka, Saya, and Lucy a test to see if they can do their new jobs properly. Yutaka demonstrates his surprisingly amazing memory by reciting a nurse insurance law, receiving T\u014dko's e-mail address as a reward. Saya's nervousness causes T\u014dko to become angry, and Mrs. Tanaka comes to the rescue by scolding her harshly. T\u014dko is relieved to see that Lucy is normal, until she asks Lucy her name, to which Lucy recites her entire name. T\u014dko, fed up with the newbies, complains to Taishi, who tells her that she's bothering everyone around her. She begins crying, so he hugs her and gives her money to placate her before sending her home. Saya then discovers that T\u014dko's full name is T\u014dko Ichimiya, thus making her Taishi's little sister. Taishi shares the story about how T\u014dko came to love the ward office, but it is clear that what T\u014dko adores is her brother, not the office. Afterwards, Megumi sees that Saya has a hard time saying what's on her mind, so she enlists T\u014dko's help in getting Saya to talk openly. Saya tells T\u014dko that if she continues to abuse her brother, he will never understand her true feelings, causing T\u014dko to cry again. Taishi tells her not to come back because she keeps bothering others, but Saya saves her by asking her to come back to help her learn more, though this causes Saya to lose even more time for working.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Don't Neglect the Safety of You or Your Workplace\n| AltTitle        = Okotaru na Shokuba no Anzen Mi no Anzen\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u6020\u308b\u306a \u8077\u5834\u306e\u5b89\u5168 \u8eab\u306e\u5b89\u5168}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|7|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = Megumi rebukes Taishi for questioning her on whether he is a reliable senpai before giving her an assessment of Lucy.

In the records room, Lucy breaks her bra forcing her to wear the office uniform. As she interacts with Saya, Megumi, Taishi, and Yutaka they all come to notice that something is wrong with her bra. At lunch the four contemplate how to address Lucy's predicament with her however Yutaka takes the initiative and realizing his intentions, the other three agree forcing her to go home.

Seeing her leaving though, he follows her and invites her out to lunch while at a bookstore where she reveals that she usually doesn't have money before payday as she buys too many books. Even after dinner, he forgets to ask for her email address. In the supply room, Yutaka and Taishi hear out Lucy's insecurities about her abilities and name. Later as she is having trouble with a child, Yutaka arrives to entertain the girl as Lucy realizes he is able to use ventriloquism. Yutaka meets Lucy a few times while it is raining and discovers that she is afraid of lightning and thunder. He helps Lucy but has some fun as he tells Megumi that Lucy was busy for so long due to filling out the name section on documents. Lucy oversees Yutaka using sign language and ends up questioning him about himself. As they're talking, Lucy agrees to learn sign language but not before she repays the previous favor which ends up being settled by her telling Yutaka her cup size. A shocked Yutaka starts counting to verify her size as Lucy yells at him to stop before running off.

Annoyed by Taishi, Megumi heads back to work where she dictates to Lucy that they will go shopping for her skirt. At the store, Lucy and Megumi meet Saya and T\u014dko but the latter two leave due to Lucy being self conscious about her clothing and her ability to wear almost all kinds. Lucy takes on a new attitude after Megumi tells her that looking down on herself is rude to others around her. At work the next day the two run into Yutaka where Lucy says she wanted to accompany him until the end, naively implying marriage. While Saya and Lucy are talking, Kaoru appears and takes the two out to eat where she recollects to the two about J\u014dji. At work, Yutaka believes that Lucy is getting married leaving him in a distraught mood. In the break room, Lucy tells him about her Tosho card while congratulating him about Kaoru's engagement as he gets a text from his sister saying she is the one getting married. Embarrassed at his misunderstanding, he slams his phone to the floor telling Lucy that he'll get a new one as he was going to erase all the girls' emails he had anyway. Not understanding, Yutaka tells Lucy it means he doesn't need any other girl than her. Lucy is seen in blushingly high spirits after that while Yutaka is secluded at his desk.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = It'll Be Good Later, At the Same Time Good Things Can Cause Huge Regrets\n| AltTitle        = Atode ii Tsuide de ii wa Ookina Koukai\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u3042\u3068\u3067\u826f\u3044 \u3064\u3044\u3067\u3067\u826f\u3044\u306f \u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f8c\u6094}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = With Taishi not home, Megumi plans on telling T\u014dko she is going out with her brother. Exhausted from studying so much and eating the cake that Megumi brought, T\u014dko misinterprets what Megumi is saying and eventually falls asleep. Relaxing too much, Megumi falls asleep with T\u014dko's head in her lap. After arriving home, Taishi annoys Megumi once again. At work, Megumi discusses T\u014dko's studying with Saya but Saya reveals that she knows Megumi and Taishi are going out telling her not to worry too much. After work J\u014dji meets Saya on her way out as he is trying to challenge Yutaka. As Megumi ponders about the Ichimiya siblings, Lucy echoes Saya's earlier comments toward Megumi. Outside of the building, due to Saya's comments about his actions, J\u014dji is led to tears causing a scene for Saya. The next day Saya has \"hangover from regrets\". Kanon visits the welfare office to meet with T\u014dko but kills some time wandering around where she meets Yutaka several times. Attempting to play off his slacking as actual work, he's caught by Taishi. Kanon meets Lucy who recommends the shop on the first floor but on her way there, passes by Megumi who asks her for her measurements. Heading to Saya, Kenzo accidentally runs across her and T\u014dko talking where he passes himself off as being a simple stuffed animal. As she is leaving, T\u014dko remembers she left her phone at Saya's desk but when she goes to pick it up, she sees everyone talking to Kenzo. She's left with the belief that they're all doing it because she has been too hard on them. As she is about to apologize to her brother and Yutaka, she sees Lucy with Kenzo on her head and Saya walking chatting with each other. Discovering the bunny is actually the section manager, she runs off embarrassed by her actions. The next day Kanon drops off her dad believing each of his subordinates to be weird but with them agreeing that he is the weirdest of them all.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Beware the Sweet Trap that Tries to Lure You In\n| AltTitle        = Atenshon Anata o Nerau Amai Wana\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30a2\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3092\u72d9\u3046 \u7518\u3044\u7f60}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = Yutaka is still trying to avoid Lucy after that \"confession\" an episode ago. Lucy tries to talk to him and looks for him, but everyone says he's just slacking around somewhere. Kenzo finds her later and accompanies her to go look for him. In the process Kenzo was accidentally sold as a stuffed toy at the outdoor bazaar outside the city hall. He is recovered just in time when the girl who bought him immediately grabbed the substitute stuffed bunny \"because it was cuter,\" much to his chagrin. Later, as Yutaka tries to hide by eating his lunch at the rooftop, he finds Lucy in there eating bread crusts for lunch, hoping that she would find him in there. As he gives him the sandwich he has Lucy explains her actions back then, her being not used to men being around her. Meanwhile, Saya, while trying to psyche herself up before her date with Joji, decides to go into town on her day-off, where she weirdly comes across everyone in the office--Lucy, Megumi, Yutaka, Taishi, even Kanon and Kenzo and Mrs. Tanaka herself. Yutaka hears of Joji's date with Saya (when Saya consulted with Megumi and Lucy), so he warns him not to do weird things to her. During the date they talk of nothing but Yutaka, so when Saya tried to change the subject, she becomes amused when she finds out he can't talk of anything (familiar) other than his \"rival.\" And before he could talk about certain regrets, Saya fainted after taking a sip of red wine. She later finds herself being carried by Joji quite a distance from the restaurant. He said he had fun during the date, and asks her for another one for later, to which she agrees. The next day, amidst a hangover, she tells Yutaka that Joji is fine if he's not involved.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| Title           = Wait a Moment, Being Accustomed and Being Unprepared Are Life-Threatening\n| AltTitle        = Chotto Mate nare to Yudan ga Inochidori\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4e00\u5bf8\u5f85\u3066 \u6163\u308c\u3068\u6cb9\u65ad\u304c \u547d\u53d6\u308a}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Megumi took three days off to finish all of her costume projects, including the dress Lucy is to wear during her date with Yutaka. Megumi warned Taishi not to text her, call her, or come to her apartment, but he goes to her apartment on the third day to check her out anyway, and as a result he weaseled out of that shopping trip he promised Toko, much to her disdain. He finds the door to her apartment unlocked, and, as he entered, sees her on the floor, flat, but all work completed. He later helped clean her apartment, make food, and become her pillow for the rest of the night. The next day, before her date, Megumi instructs Lucy to watch Yutaka and find out what kind of person he really is, to see if he is a decent guy or not. Lucy was shocked to find out that the dress she is to wear was too short, but Megumi insists it's okay. But she is so embarrassed with the dress that she even thinks of postponing it. In fact, on the day of her date with Yutaka, Lucy did arrive around twenty minutes late. During the date Lucy did observe that he paid attention to her, even being protective of her. She even got freaked out by Yutaka's in-date behavior that she ran like mad and tripped. As Yutaka tended to the scratch on her knee, she confronted Lucy about her problem that is her long, ridiculous name. He also asked her as to how she thinks of him. Lucy, nervous, is unable to give an answer, until Yutaka got a call about his sister Kaoru's marriage meeting, and he was requested to come, ending the date early; but Lucy says they can do it again some time. Megumi is lurking in the shadows ready to intervene if something goes wrong, while trying to tell Toko, who is with her, about her relationship with her brother. There she finds out that Toko doesn't mind if her brother has a girlfriend. The next day Yutaka does his work without slacking off, though with some mistakes. Taishi, Saya, and Megumi notices this and finds it worrisome, and, asking him, they find out the (shocking) reason: that the one who approved Lucy's name was his own father.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = Now We're Set, A Fun Workplace Leading to Tomorrow\n| AltTitle        = Korede Yoshi Ashita ni Tsunagu Tanoshii Shokuba\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u3053\u308c\u3067\u826f\u3057 \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u3064\u306a\u3050 \u697d\u3057\u3044\u8077\u5834}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Taishi, Saya, and Megumi found the reason of Yutaka's weird behavior, they also knew another reason why Yutaka avoided Lucy. It was because at the day Lucy's name was brought to the ward office, Yutaka was down in a high fever until he was taken into a hospital. His father became so worried about him and thus couldn't concentrate in his work, which was why he accidentally approved Lucy's name without even thinking about it any further. Depressed by the truth that he was the indirect reason why Lucy had a long name, Yutaka was afraid that Lucy would hate him since she was so concerned about her name. The three tried to cheer him up, but in the end they only made it worse. When Lucy came into the room, they quickly changed the subject, and Lucy saw Yutaka's dejected and sad face towards her. Because of this, she became concerned that maybe she had done something bad to Yutaka. One day when Lucy was about to go home, Taishi went to Yutaka and cheered him up, by saying that it will be harder to say the truth the longer he holds it in. Cheered up by Taishi's words, Yutaka chased after Lucy and finally told the truth to her. However, Lucy didn't think that Yutaka was at fault since anyone could catch a fever. Because of Yutaka's insistence, Lucy assumed that if everything was Yutaka's fault, he had to take responsibility. She asked him to keep calling her by her first name because she began to like him calling her Lucy all the time. Just when Yutaka was about to confess to her, Joji, Kanon, Toko, and Kenzo suddenly came in, ruining the mood. The three who was listening all the time shoved all of them away, and the mood became awkward once again. When the two of them were outside, Yutaka once again tried to ask Lucy out. The latter only rejected, but gave him a hope by saying, \"Not yet\". The others quickly caught up to the two and started to ruin the mood again. The next day, Taishi tried to tell Toko about his relationship with Megumi, only to fail since he was nervous. Yutaka became so energetic and enthusiastic in his work. Saya reprimanded Joji for ruining Lucy's and Yutaka's moments. As the two's mood were getting better, all of them were back to their jobs. After the ending credits, Yutaka finally got Lucy's email address and Megumi told them to explode.\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.servantservice.org/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|manga|15240}}\n\n{{A-1 Pictures}}\n{{Gangan Comics manga franchises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Servant x Service}}\n[[Category:A-1 Pictures]]\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:Anime set in Hokkaido]]\n[[Category:Aniplex]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Gangan Comics manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Slice of life anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Square Enix franchises]]\n[[Category:Tokyo MX shows]]\n[[Category:Yen Press titles]]\n[[Category:Yonkoma]]\n", "name_user": "Sarcataclysmal", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_%C3%97_Service"}

Its historical center is the village of [[Ubli, Podgorica|Ubli]].\n\nKu\u010di first appears in historical record in 1330 as part of an Albanian ''katun'' (pastoral community) in the area between [[Tuzi]] and [[Shkodra]]. In the 15th century, they moved northwards to their present location. Over time, several waves of settlers came to populate the region and form the historical community of Ku\u010di. The region is known for its resistance against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and its key role in the creation of modern [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. In the 18th century, both non-voluntarily and voluntarily many people from the ''pleme'' began to settle in the [[Sand\u017eak]] region. Many of their descendants identify as Muslim Bosniaks.  Until the 17th century, the Ku\u010di region was half Orthodox and half Catholic. Today, it is mostly Orthodox except for the Catholic community of [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]].\n\nThe history of the people of Ku\u010di represents the diversity of the area and its location at the crossroads between different cultures and religions. [[Marko Miljanov]] (1833-1901), a national hero of Montenegro who led the tribe in the Montenegrin-Ottomans Wars in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|1861\u201362]] and [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|1876\u201378]], [[Jakup Ferri]] (1832-1879), a national hero of Albania who fought against Miljanov's annexation of his home territory [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] to Montenegro and [[Muamer Zukorli\u0107]], a modern Bosniak politician in the Sand\u017eak are all from Ku\u010di.\n\n==Geography==\nKu\u010di is within the municipality of [[Podgorica]] and comprises almost the entirety of eastern Podgorica. [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]] is part of [[Tuzi Municipality]] The unofficial centre is the [[Ubli, Podgorica|Ubli]] village. It had 227 inhabitants in the 2011 Montenegrin census and houses several institutions like a culture hall, the \"\u0110oko Prelevi\u0107\" elementary school, a hospital, police station, and a former fabric factory.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=393&pageid=57 |website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref> Ubli is situated in central Ku\u010di with the center and villages of Prelevi\u0107i, Pavi\u0107evi\u0107i, \u017divkovi\u0107i, Kostrovi\u0107i, etc. Other villages are: [[Medun]], Orahovo, [[Fundina]], [[Ko\u0107i]], Kr\u017eanja, Kosor, Vrbica, Strav\u010de, Zagreda, Ra\u0107i in northern Ku\u010di and Doljani, Murtovina, Stara Zlatica, Zlatica in southern Ku\u010di.\n\nThe Ku\u010di region itself can be divided into three major historical sub-regions:\n*Old Ku\u010di (''Staro Ku\u010di''), Orthodox sub-tribe, which celebrates the slava of Mitrovdan ([[Saint Demetrius]]).\n*Drekalovi\u0107i(''Novo Ku\u010di''), Orthodox sub-tribe, which celebrates the slava of Nikoljdan ([[Saint Nicholas]]).\n*[[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]] is a Catholic Albanian tribe. It includes the settlements of [[Ko\u0107i]], Fundina.The region of Koja stands between [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] in the south and Ku\u010di proper in the north. The people of Koja are referred to as ''Kojan\u00eb''. It is the last region of wider Ku\u010di that became part of Montenegro in 1880.\n\nSome villages stand between its sub-regions. For example, the village of Orahovo is situated between Old Ku\u010di and Koja. Other settlements that were once part of one Ku\u010di tribal region moved over time to another region.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Old Kuci 1416.png|thumb|300px|Village of Ku\u00e7, Shkod\u00ebr, Albania in 1416-7]]\n\nKu\u010di is not a tribe (''pleme'') of the same patrilineal ancestry. Rather, as many other tribes in the region, it formed as consecutive waves of groups settled in the area and formed the Ku\u010di community. \n\nThe first time Ku\u010di (known in the subgroupings of modern Ku\u010di as ''Old Ku\u010di'') is mentioned in historical record is in 1330 in the De\u010dani chrysobulls as part of the Albanian (''arbanas'') ''katun'' (semi-nomadic pastoral community) of Llesh Tuzi (''Ljesa Tuzi'' in the original), in an area stretching southwards from modern [[Tuzi Municipality]] along the [[Lake Skadar]] to a village near modern [[Koplik]], and were headed by a Pjet\u00ebr Ku\u00e7i (''Petra Ku\u010di'').<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=94-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref> In this area by the early 15th century they had formed a permanent settlement. Ku\u010di is listed in the Venetian cadaster of 1416-7 of Shkodra (''Scutari'') as a small village of eight households \u00a0near the city itself. It was headed by a ''Jon Nada'' (a mistake from the scribe who wrote ''Nada'' instead of ''Nenada'').<ref name=\"Zamputi\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Regjistri i kadastr\u0113s dhe i koncesioneve p\u0113r rrethin e Shkodr\u00ebs 1416-1417 |date=1977 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania |url=https://www.academia.edu/33718705/AKADEMIA_E_SHKENCAVE_E_REPUBUKES_TE_SHQIPERISE |pages=56 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |ref=Buda}}</ref> Two other heads of households are sons of Nenad, Gjergj (''Giergi'' in the original document) and Laz\u00ebr (''Lazzaro''). A person married into the village is ''Jon Progani'', who was married to ''Nesa'' (a diminutive of the name ''Nenad''). His son, Gjin Progani was also a household head as were ''Jon Serapa'' and ''Gjergj Tina'' and ''Pali Samrishi''.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/> They paid one ducat per household in taxes to the Venetian governor of Scutari.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/> Members of this brotherhood also lived in other villages in the area like in Shurdhani, where three out of six households were from Ku\u00e7i.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/>\n\nUp until the end of the 15th century, Ku\u010di had not formed as a tribe. After 1479, the area came under Ottoman control. In the Ottoman [[defter]] of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485, Ku\u010di appears as a [[nahiye]] for the first time in its modern location. At this point, the nahiye of Ku\u010di comprised communities that later formed two different administrative units and [[bajrak]]s: Ku\u010di and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]]. The total number of households in the eight settlements of the nahiya were 253. These (with household numbers in brackets) were: Pantalesh (110), Brokina (12) , Bardhani (25), Radona (55), Bankeq (11), Stani (24), Bytidosi (11), Llazor\u00e7i (5).<ref name=\"Pulaha\">{{cite book |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Defter i Sanxhakut t\u00eb Shkodr\u00ebs 1485 |date=1974 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania |page=119 |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3ma9plMXxAEZi1PZTVXMXV1NFE/edit |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha}}</ref> Llazor\u00e7i was a settlement of another small tribe, the Lazori who appear as part of the Albanian katun in 1330.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\"/> By 1485, they had moved northwards with the Ku\u010di brotherhoods. Bankeq and a part of Bytidosi are related with the historical region of Triepshi.

Its historical center is the village of [[Ubli, Podgorica|Ubli]].\n\nKu\u010di first appears in historical record in 1330 as part of an Albanian ''katun'' (pastoral community) in the area between [[Tuzi]] and [[Shkodra]]. In the 15th century, they moved northwards to their present location. Over time, several waves of settlers came to populate the region and form the historical community of Ku\u010di. The region is known for its resistance against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and its key role in the creation of modern [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. In the 18th century, both non-voluntarily and voluntarily many people from the ''pleme'' began to settle in the [[Sand\u017eak]] region. Many of their descendants identify as Muslim Bosniaks.  Until the 17th century, Ku\u010di was half Orthodox and half Catholic. Today, it is mostly Orthodox except for the Catholic community of [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]].\n\nThe history of the people of Ku\u010di represents the diversity of the area and its location at the crossroads between different cultures and religions. [[Marko Miljanov]] (1833-1901), a national hero of Montenegro who led the tribe in the Montenegrin-Ottomans Wars in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|1861\u201362]] and [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|1876\u201378]], [[Jakup Ferri]] (1832-1879), a national hero of Albania who fought against Miljanov's annexation of his home territory [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] to Montenegro and [[Muamer Zukorli\u0107]], a modern Bosniak politician in the Sand\u017eak are all from Ku\u010di.\n\n==Geography==\nKu\u010di is within the municipality of [[Podgorica]] and comprises almost the entirety of eastern Podgorica. [[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]] is part of [[Tuzi Municipality]] The unofficial centre is the [[Ubli, Podgorica|Ubli]] village. It had 227 inhabitants in the 2011 Montenegrin census and houses several institutions like a culture hall, the \"\u0110oko Prelevi\u0107\" elementary school, a hospital, police station, and a former fabric factory.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=393&pageid=57 |website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref> Ubli is situated in central Ku\u010di with the center and villages of Prelevi\u0107i, Pavi\u0107evi\u0107i, \u017divkovi\u0107i, Kostrovi\u0107i, etc. Other villages are: [[Medun]], Orahovo, [[Fundina]], [[Ko\u0107i]], Kr\u017eanja, Kosor, Vrbica, Strav\u010de, Zagreda, Ra\u0107i in northern Ku\u010di and Doljani, Murtovina, Stara Zlatica, Zlatica in southern Ku\u010di.\n\nThe Ku\u010di region itself can be divided into three major historical sub-regions:\n*Old Ku\u010di (''Staro Ku\u010di''), Orthodox sub-tribe, which celebrates the slava of Mitrovdan ([[Saint Demetrius]]).\n*Drekalovi\u0107i(''Novo Ku\u010di''), Orthodox sub-tribe, which celebrates the slava of Nikoljdan ([[Saint Nicholas]]).\n*[[Koja e Ku\u00e7it|Koja]] is a Catholic Albanian tribe. It includes the settlements of [[Ko\u0107i]], Fundina.The region of Koja stands between [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] in the south and Ku\u010di proper in the north. The people of Koja are referred to as ''Kojan\u00eb''. It is the last region of wider Ku\u010di that became part of Montenegro in 1880.\n\nSome villages stand between its sub-regions. For example, the village of Orahovo is situated between Old Ku\u010di and Koja. Other settlements that were once part of one Ku\u010di tribal region moved over time to another region.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Old Kuci 1416.png|thumb|300px|Village of Ku\u00e7, Shkod\u00ebr, Albania in 1416-7]]\n\nKu\u010di is not a tribe (''pleme'') of the same patrilineal ancestry. Rather, as many other tribes in the region, it formed as consecutive waves of groups settled in the area and formed the Ku\u010di community. \n\nThe first time Ku\u010di (known in the subgroupings of modern Ku\u010di as ''Old Ku\u010di'') is mentioned in historical record is in 1330 in the De\u010dani chrysobulls as part of the Albanian (''arbanas'') ''katun'' (semi-nomadic pastoral community) of Llesh Tuzi (''Ljesa Tuzi'' in the original), in an area stretching southwards from modern [[Tuzi Municipality]] along the [[Lake Skadar]] to a village near modern [[Koplik]], and were headed by a Pjet\u00ebr Ku\u00e7i (''Petra Ku\u010di'').<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=94-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref> In this area by the early 15th century they had formed a permanent settlement. Ku\u010di is listed in the Venetian cadaster of 1416-7 of Shkodra (''Scutari'') as a small village of eight households \u00a0near the city itself.

His son, Gjin Progani was also a household head as were ''Jon Serapa'' and ''Gjergj Tina'' and ''Pali Samrishi''.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/> They paid one ducat per household in taxes to the Venetian governor of Scutari.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/> Members of this brotherhood also lived in other villages in the area like in Shurdhani, where three out of six households were from Ku\u00e7i.<ref name=\"Zamputi\"/>\n\nUp until the end of the 15th century, Ku\u010di had not formed as a tribe. After 1479, the area came under Ottoman control. In the Ottoman [[defter]] of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485, Ku\u010di appears as a [[nahiye]] for the first time in its modern location. At this point, the nahiye of Ku\u010di comprised communities that later formed two different administrative units and [[bajrak]]s: Ku\u010di and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]]. The total number of households in the eight settlements of the nahiya were 253. These (with household numbers in brackets) were: Pantalesh (110), Brokina (12) , Bardhani (25), Radona (55), Bankeq (11), Stani (24), Bytidosi (11), Llazor\u00e7i (5).<ref name=\"Pulaha\">{{cite book |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Defter i Sanxhakut t\u00eb Shkodr\u00ebs 1485 |date=1974 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania |page=119 |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3ma9plMXxAEZi1PZTVXMXV1NFE/edit |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha}}</ref> Llazor\u00e7i was a settlement of another small tribe, the Lazori who appear as part of the Albanian katun in 1330.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\"/> By 1485, they had moved northwards with the Ku\u010di brotherhoods.

Sumatra''' ({{lang-id|Sumatra Utara}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. It consists of a large northwestern belt of the island of [[Sumatra]] and its capital is [[Medan, Indonesia|Medan]]. North Sumatra is the fourth most-populous province after [[West Java]], [[East Java]] and [[Central Java]] &mdash; it covers an area of 72,981 sq.km, and at the Census of 2015 it had a population of 13,923,262; the latest official estimate as at mid 2019 is 14,639,400.<ref name=\"depkes.go.id\">Badan Pusat Statistik, 2019.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe last seafarers that made it to Sumatra were the Dutch. A government of North Sumatra named ''Gouvernement van Sumatra'' with the area covering the whole of the island of Sumatra, was headed by a governor who was based in the city of Medan.\n\nAfter independence, the first session of the National Committee of Regions (KND), Sumatra was then divided into three sub-provinces namely North Sumatra, Central Sumatra and South Sumatra. North Sumatra province itself was an amalgamation of three administrative regions called Residencies namely: the Residency of Aceh, the [[East Sumatra]] Residency, and the Residency of Tapanuli.\n\nWith the publication of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia (R.I.) No. 10 Year 1948 on April 15, 1948, it was determined that Sumatra was divided into three provinces, each of which has the right to organize and manage their own household, namely: North Sumatra, Central Sumatra Province, and South Sumatra Province. The date of 15 April 1948 was subsequently determined as the anniversary of North Sumatra Province.\n\nIn early 1949, the reorganization of government took place in Sumatra, with the decision of the Government Emergency R.I. No. 22 / Govt / Emergency Government on May 17, 1949, which abolished the post of Governor of North Sumatra. Furthermore, the Government Emergency Decree R.I. on December 17, 1949, established the Province of Aceh and [[Tapanuli Province|Tapanuli]] Province / East Sumatra. Then, with a Government Regulation in lieu of Law No. 5 Year 1950 on August 14, 1950, such provisions were lifted and reshaped North Sumatra Province.\n\nAct R.I. No. 24 of 1956, promulgated on December 7, 1956, established an autonomous Aceh Province, independent of the Province of North Sumatra.<ref>[http://www.sumutprov.go.id/tentang-provsu/sejarah Sejarah Pemerintah Provinsi Sumatra Utara]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Sipiso-Piso Falls Danau Toba View.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Toba, World's largest volcanic lake]]\nThe province of North Sumatra stretches across the island of [[Sumatra]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Strait of Malacca]]. It borders [[Aceh]] province on the northwest and [[Riau]] and [[West Sumatra]] provinces in the southeast. It has an area of 72,981 &nbsp;km\u00b2. The province contains a broad, low plain along the Strait of Malacca on which the provincial capital, Medan, is located. In the south and west, the land rises to the mountain range that runs the length of Sumatra; the mountains here are dominated by [[Lake Toba]], formed from the [[caldera]] of an ancient volcano.  Several large islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] off the west coast of Sumatra are currently part of North Sumatra, most notably [[Nias]] Island and the [[Batu Islands]].\n\nThere are 419 islands in North Sumatra province. The outer islands is the island Simuk ([[Nias Island|Nias]]), and the island [[Berhala Island (Sumatra)|Berhala]] in the Strait of Sumatra (Malacca).\n\nNias archipelago consists of the island as the main island and other smaller islands in the vicinity. Nias Islands located off the coast of western [[Indian Ocean]]. Administration center located in [[Gunung Sitoli]].\n\nBatu Islands consist of 51 islands with four major islands: Sibuasi, Pini, Tanahbala, Tanahmasa. Pulautelo administrative center on the island Sibuasi. Batu Islands located in the southeast of the island of Nias. Other islands in the North Sumatra: Imanna, Pasu, Bawa, Hamutaia, Batumakalele, Lego, Masa, Bau, Simaleh, Makole, Jake, and Sigata, Wunga.\n\nIn North Sumatra, there are currently two national parks, the [[Gunung Leuser National Park]] and [[Batang Gadis National Park]]. According to the Ministerial Decree, No. 44 of 2005, the forest area in North Sumatra today 3.74212 million hectares (ha). Which consists of a Natural Reserve Area / Natural Conservation Area covering an area of 477 070 ha, 1.29733 million ha of protected forest, limited production forest 879 270 ha, Permanent production forest 1,035,690 ha and production forest that can be converted covering 52 760 ha.\n\nBut this figure character is '' de jure '' alone. Because as a '' de facto '', the existing forests is not covering it anymore. Happens a lot of damage due to [[wikt:encroachment|encroachment]] and [[illegal logging]]. So far, over 206,000 ha of forest in Sumatra has experienced changes in function. Has been turned into plantations, transmigration.

A government of North Sumatra named ''Gouvernement van Sumatra'' with the area covering the whole of the island of Sumatra, was headed by a governor who was based in the city of Medan.\n\nAfter independence, the first session of the National Committee of Regions (KND), Sumatra was then divided into three sub-provinces namely North Sumatra, Central Sumatra and South Sumatra. North Sumatra province itself was an amalgamation of three administrative regions called Residencies namely: the Residency of Aceh, the [[East Sumatra]] Residency, and the Residency of Tapanuli.\n\nWith the publication of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia (R.I.) No. 10 Year 1948 on April 15, 1948, it was determined that Sumatra was divided into three provinces, each of which has the right to organize and manage their own household, namely: North Sumatra, Central Sumatra Province, and South Sumatra Province. The date of 15 April 1948 was subsequently determined as the anniversary of North Sumatra Province.\n\nIn early 1949, the reorganization of government took place in Sumatra, with the decision of the Government Emergency R.I. No. 22 / Govt / Emergency Government on May 17, 1949, which abolished the post of Governor of North Sumatra. Furthermore, the Government Emergency Decree R.I. on December 17, 1949, established the Province of Aceh and [[Tapanuli Province|Tapanuli]] Province / East Sumatra. Then, with a Government Regulation in lieu of Law No. 5 Year 1950 on August 14, 1950, such provisions were lifted and reshaped North Sumatra Province.\n\nAct R.I. No. 24 of 1956, promulgated on December 7, 1956, established an autonomous Aceh Province, independent of the Province of North Sumatra.<ref>[http://www.sumutprov.go.id/tentang-provsu/sejarah Sejarah Pemerintah Provinsi Sumatra Utara]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Sipiso-Piso Falls Danau Toba View.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Toba, World's largest volcanic lake]]\nThe province of North Sumatra stretches across the island of [[Sumatra]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Strait of Malacca]].

The class comprised two ships, ''Charles Martel'' and ''Brennus'', and represented an incremental improvement over the preceding {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|4}}, being larger, but carrying the same [[main battery]] of four {{cvt|340|mm|1}} guns in single mounts. Details of the ships' construction are unclear and contradictory, with various sources reporting that both ships were [[keel laying|laid down]], or that only ''Brennus'' was begun; neither ship was [[ship launching|launched]] before they were cancelled in 1884 or 1886. Some sources indicate that ''Brennus'' was redesigned and completed as France's first [[pre-dreadnought battleship]], {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}, but most other historians dispute the idea.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:French ironclad Marceau NH 75908.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|French ironclad|Marceau||2}}, which provided the basis of the ''Charles Martel'' design]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871, the [[French Navy]] embarked on a construction program to strengthen the fleet in 1872 and to replace older vessels that had been built in the 1860s. By the early 1870s, the Italian {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy) had begun its own expansion program under the direction of [[Benedetto Brin]], which included the construction of several very large [[ironclad warship]]s of the {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|4}}es, armed with {{cvt|450|mm|1}} 100-ton guns. The French initially viewed the ships as not worthy of concern, though by 1877, public pressure over the new Italian vessels prompted the Navy's {{lang|fr|Conseil des Travaux}} (Board of Construction) to design a response, beginning with the [[barbette ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Duperr\u00e9||2}} and following with six vessels carrying 100-guns of French design. The first of these were the two {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}}s, which carried their guns in open [[barbette]]s, all on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], with one forward and two aft.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nBy the early 1880s, the very large guns had fallen out of favor in the French Navy, so the remaining four ships, to be laid down beginning in 1880, were redesigned with smaller but equally powerful weapons. These became the {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|4}}, which was to have comprised four ships. The first vessel that was [[keel laying|laid down]], {{ship|French ironclad|Hoche||2}}, had to be reworked after the plans proved to be unfeasible. The four ships arranged their [[main battery]] in a [[lozenge]] pattern with one forward, one aft, and a [[wing turret|wing mount]] on either side [[amidships]] to maximize end-on fire (which was emphasized by those who favored [[naval ram|ramming]] attacks).{{sfn|Ropp|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nAt the same time, developments with [[quick-firing gun]]s rendered the generation of French capital ships designed in the 1870s and early 1880s dangerously vulnerable to damage above the [[waterline]]. These ships used shallow waterline [[belt armor]] to protect their sides, but most of their [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] were unprotected by armor altogether. Many navies began to incorporate thin side protection above the belt to deal with the threat. Further complicating matters were the developments of self-propelled [[torpedo]]es and small, fast [[torpedo boat]]s that posed an existential threat to the battleship-dominated fleets of the European navies.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=138\u2013139, 221\u2013222}}\n\n==Development and cancellation==\nThe fleet program of 1880 projected a total of six new ironclad battleships; the first four were to be the ''Marceau''s and ''Hoche''. The remaining pair of vessels was due to begin construction in 1882. An initial plan by the naval engineer [[Louis de Bussy]] called for a ship modeled on the British ironclad {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, carrying a main battery of four {{cvt|340|mm|1}} guns in a pair of [[gun turret]]s arranged ''en echelon'' amidships. Before work on the vessels began, the French naval command reconsidered and opted for an improved ''Marceau'', and a new design was prepared by [[Charles Ernest Huin]], who had designed the ''Marceau''s and ''Hoche''. The new design repeated the lozenge arrangement of the main battery in single mounts.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} \n\nThe exact timeline for the design and construction of the ships are unclear. According to John Jordan and Philip Caresse, Huin's design was approved in January 1885 and work on the two ships, ''Charles Martel'' and ''Brennus'', began that year in [[Toulon]] and [[Lorient]], respectively. They credit Admiral [[Th\u00e9ophile Aube]], who became the [[French Minister of Marine]] in January 1886, as immediately suspending work on the new ships. Aube was a proponent of the {{lang|fr|[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]}} (Young School), which held that cheap torpedo boats could effectively replace the [[capital ship]]s that had been the primary component of naval power.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}\n\nBut according to naval historian [[Theodore Ropp]], the decision to cancel the vessels had been made in late 1884, during the tenure of Admiral [[Alexandre Peyron]]; while he was not a partisan of the {{lang|fr|Jeune \u00c9cole}}, he was also not convinced that further battleship construction was warranted during a period of technological uncertainty. He remained committed to completing the ''Marceau'' class and ''Hoche'', as they were already well advanced in construction, but was unwilling to authorize construction of any new vessels.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=138\u2013139}} This is corroborated by the 1887 edition of the contemporary journal ''[[The Naval Annual]]'', which reported that the decision was made to suspend the vessels on 24 October 1884. But [[Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey|Thomas Brassey]] noted that the ships had been ordered in 1882 and that at least some work on the [[keel]] for ''Brennus'' had already been completed by that point, though ''Charles Martel'' had not yet been laid down.{{sfn|Brassey 1888|pp=650, 662\u2013663}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Brennus NH 82700.jpg|thumb|The second {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}, sometimes believed to be the same vessel as the ''Charles Martel''-class ship]]\n\nIn 1887, Aube left the ministry and his replacement, [[\u00c9douard Barbey]], disagreed with his predecessor over the future shape of the French fleet. Huin suggested reworking the design for ''Brennus'', which Barbey accepted, resulting in France's first [[pre-dreadnought battleship]], {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}. Again, there is some confusion as to the ship's fate. Jordan and Caresse seem to indicate that the two vessels were one in the same, stating that \"work on the partially built ''Brennus'' resumed in 1889.\"{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=18\u201320}} But in another publication, Caresse provides a new keel-laying date for ''Brennus'' on 2 January 1889,{{sfn|Caresse|p=32}} and Brassey indicates the two were different vessels.{{efn|Brassey quotes a French report that states, \"Had these plans [for the original ''Brennus''] been adopted, we should have had a vessel no longer equal to the requirements that have arisen since she was first designed. However regrettable the loss of some thousands of pounds may be, the minister determined to call upon the constructors for a vessel answering in every respect the latest requirements.{{sfn|Brassey 1888|p=663}}}} Speaking of ''Charles Martel'', the historian Luc Feron stated more plainly, instructing readers to \"[not] confuse this one with the 12,000-ton battleship of the 1890 program which was actually built.\"{{sfn|Feron|p=71}} ''Charles Martel'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in Toulon and some of her components were reused in other projects. Her name was reused in the later battleship {{ship|French battleship|Charles Martel||2}}, also designed by Huin.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=20}}\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe two ''Charles Martel''-class ships were to have been {{cvt|344|ft|6|in|order=flip|0}} [[long at the waterline]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|64|ft|order=flip|1}}. ''Charles Martel'' was to [[displacement (ship)|displace]] {{cvt|10650|LT|t|lk=on}}, while ''Brennus'' was to have been slightly lighter, at {{cvt|10600|LT|t}}; both vessels' [[draft (hull)|draft]] was to have been {{cvt|29|ft|6|in|order=flip}}. They were steel-hulled vessels. Their propulsion system was to have consisted of three [[marine steam engine]]s of unrecorded type, each driving a [[screw propeller]]. Their engines were rated to produce a top speed of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|5500|ihp|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Brassey 1886|p=224}}\n\nThe ships' primary armament was to have consisted of four 340&nbsp;mm guns carried in individual mounts in the French lozenge arrangement.{{sfn|Brassey 1886|p=224}} The guns fired {{cvt|350|kg}} [[high-explosive]] shells filled with [[Picric acid|melinite]] with a muzzle velocity of {{cvt|555|m/s}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=206\u2013207}} These would have been supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of eight {{cvt|140|mm}} guns in individual [[casemate]] mounts. Close-range defense against torpedo boats would have been provided by seven light auto-cannon of unrecorded type. The ships would have been protected with [[compound armor]]; their belt was to have been {{cvt|17.25|in|order=flip|-1}}, but unlike all previous French ironclads, it did not cover the entire length of the hull.

The class comprised two ships, ''Charles Martel'' and ''Brennus'', and represented an incremental improvement over the preceding {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|4}}, being larger, but carrying the same [[main battery]] of four {{cvt|340|mm|1}} guns in single mounts. Details of the ships' construction are unclear and contradictory, with various sources reporting that both ships were [[keel laying|laid down]], or that only ''Brennus'' was begun; neither ship was [[ship launching|launched]] before they were cancelled in 1884 or 1886. Some sources indicate that ''Brennus'' was redesigned and completed as France's first [[pre-dreadnought battleship]], {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}, but most other historians dispute the idea.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:French ironclad Marceau NH 75908.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|French ironclad|Marceau||2}}, which provided the basis of the ''Charles Martel'' design]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871, the [[French Navy]] embarked on a construction program to strengthen the fleet in 1872 and to replace older vessels that had been built in the 1860s. By the early 1870s, the Italian {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy) had begun its own expansion program under the direction of [[Benedetto Brin]], which included the construction of several very large [[ironclad warship]]s of the {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|4}}es, armed with {{cvt|450|mm|1}} 100-ton guns. The French initially viewed the ships as not worthy of concern, though by 1877, public pressure over the new Italian vessels prompted the Navy's {{lang|fr|Conseil des Travaux}} (Board of Construction) to design a response, beginning with the [[barbette ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Duperr\u00e9||2}} and following with six vessels carrying 100-guns of French design. The first of these were the two {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}}s, which carried their guns in open [[barbette]]s, all on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], with one forward and two aft.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nBy the early 1880s, the very large guns had fallen out of favor in the French Navy, so the remaining four ships, to be laid down beginning in 1880, were redesigned with smaller but equally powerful weapons. These became the {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|4}}, which was to have comprised four ships. The first vessel that was [[keel laying|laid down]], {{ship|French ironclad|Hoche||2}}, had to be reworked after the plans proved to be unfeasible. The four ships arranged their [[main battery]] in a [[lozenge]] pattern with one forward, one aft, and a [[wing turret|wing mount]] on either side [[amidships]] to maximize end-on fire (which was emphasized by those who favored [[naval ram|ramming]] attacks).{{sfn|Ropp|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nAt the same time, developments with [[quick-firing gun]]s rendered the generation of French capital ships designed in the 1870s and early 1880s dangerously vulnerable to damage above the [[waterline]]. These ships used shallow waterline [[belt armor]] to protect their sides, but most of their [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] were unprotected by armor altogether. Many navies began to incorporate thin side protection above the belt to deal with the threat. Further complicating matters were the developments of self-propelled [[torpedo]]es and small, fast [[torpedo boat]]s that posed an existential threat to the battleship-dominated fleets of the European navies.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=138\u2013139, 221\u2013222}}\n\n==Development and cancellation==\nThe fleet program of 1880 projected a total of six new ironclad battleships; the first four were to be the ''Marceau''s and ''Hoche''. The remaining pair of vessels was due to begin construction in 1882. An initial plan by the naval engineer [[Louis de Bussy]] called for a ship modeled on the British ironclad {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, carrying a main battery of four {{cvt|340|mm|1}} guns in a pair of [[gun turret]]s arranged ''en echelon'' amidships. Before work on the vessels began, the French naval command reconsidered and opted for an improved ''Marceau'', and a new design was prepared by [[Charles Ernest Huin]], who had designed the ''Marceau''s and ''Hoche''. The new design repeated the lozenge arrangement of the main battery in single mounts.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} \n\nThe exact timeline for the design and construction of the ships are unclear. According to John Jordan and Philip Caresse, Huin's design was approved in January 1885 and work on the two ships, ''Charles Martel'' and ''Brennus'', began that year in [[Toulon]] and [[Lorient]], respectively. They credit Admiral [[Th\u00e9ophile Aube]], who became the [[French Minister of Marine]] in January 1886, as immediately suspending work on the new ships. Aube was a proponent of the {{lang|fr|[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]}} (Young School), which held that cheap torpedo boats could effectively replace the [[capital ship]]s that had been the primary component of naval power.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}\n\nBut according to naval historian [[Theodore Ropp]], the decision to cancel the vessels had been made in late 1884, during the tenure of Admiral [[Alexandre Peyron]]; while he was not a partisan of the {{lang|fr|Jeune \u00c9cole}}, he was also not convinced that further battleship construction was warranted during a period of technological uncertainty. He remained committed to completing the ''Marceau'' class and ''Hoche'', as they were already well advanced in construction, but was unwilling to authorize construction of any new vessels.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=138\u2013139}} This is corroborated by the 1887 edition of the contemporary journal ''[[The Naval Annual]]'', which reported that the decision was made to suspend the vessels on 24 October 1884. But [[Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey|Thomas Brassey]] noted that the ships had been ordered in 1882 and that at least some work on the [[keel]] for ''Brennus'' had already been completed by that point, though ''Charles Martel'' had not yet been laid down.{{sfn|Brassey 1888|pp=650, 662\u2013663}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Brennus NH 82700.jpg|thumb|The second {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}, sometimes believed to be the same vessel as the ''Charles Martel''-class ship]]\n\nIn 1887, Aube left the ministry and his replacement, [[\u00c9douard Barbey]], disagreed with his predecessor over the future shape of the French fleet. Huin suggested reworking the design for ''Brennus'', which Barbey accepted, resulting in France's first [[pre-dreadnought battleship]], {{ship|French battleship|Brennus||2}}. Again, there is some confusion as to the ship's fate. Jordan and Caresse seem to indicate that the two vessels were one in the same, stating that \"work on the partially built ''Brennus'' resumed in 1889.\"{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=18\u201320}} But in another publication, Caresse provides a new keel-laying date for ''Brennus'' on 2 January 1889.{{sfn|Caresse|p=32}} And Brassey indicates the two were different vessels.{{efn|Brassey quotes a French report that states, \"Had these plans [for the original ''Brennus''] been adopted, we should have had a vessel no longer equal to the requirements that have arisen since she was first designed. However regrettable the loss of some thousands of pounds may be, the minister determined to call upon the constructors for a vessel answering in every respect the latest requirements.{{sfn|Brassey 1888|p=663}}}} Speaking of ''Charles Martel'', the historian Luc Feron stated more plainly, instructing readers to \"[not] confuse this one with the 12,000-ton battleship of the 1890 program which was actually built.\"{{sfn|Feron|p=71}} ''Charles Martel'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in Toulon and some of her components were reused in other projects. Her name was reused in the later battleship {{ship|French battleship|Charles Martel||2}}, also designed by Huin.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=20}}\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe two ''Charles Martel''-class ships were to have been {{cvt|344|ft|6|in|order=flip|0}} [[long at the waterline]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|64|ft|order=flip|1}}. ''Charles Martel'' was to [[displacement (ship)|displace]] {{cvt|10650|LT|t|lk=on}}, while ''Brennus'' was to have been slightly lighter, at {{cvt|10600|LT|t}}; both vessels' [[draft (hull)|draft]] was to have been {{cvt|29|ft|6|in|order=flip}}. They were steel-hulled vessels. Their propulsion system was to have consisted of three [[marine steam engine]]s of unrecorded type, each driving a [[screw propeller]]. Their engines were rated to produce a top speed of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|5500|ihp|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Brassey 1886|p=224}}\n\nThe ships' primary armament was to have consisted of four 340&nbsp;mm guns carried in individual mounts in the French lozenge arrangement.{{sfn|Brassey 1886|p=224}} The guns fired {{cvt|350|kg}} [[high-explosive]] shells filled with [[Picric acid|melinite]] with a muzzle velocity of {{cvt|555|m/s}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=206\u2013207}} These would have been supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of eight {{cvt|140|mm}} guns in individual [[casemate]] mounts. Close-range defense against torpedo boats would have been provided by seven light auto-cannon of unrecorded type. The ships would have been protected with [[compound armor]]; their belt was to have been {{cvt|17.25|in|order=flip|-1}}, but unlike all previous French ironclads, it did not cover the entire length of the hull. An identical thickness covered their main battery barbettes.{{sfn|Brassey 1886|p=224}}{{sfn|Gardiner|p=283}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n===Notes===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n  |editor-last=Brassey\n  |editor-first=Thomas\n  |editor-link=Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey\n  |title=Foreign Ships\u2014Arranged Nationally and Alphabetically\n  |journal=The Naval Annual 1886\n  |year=1886\n  |location=Portsmouth\n  |publisher=J.
