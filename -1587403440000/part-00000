The largest cities along its route are [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], and [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. It also passes through the New Hampshire state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].\n\nFor most of its length, I-93 indirectly parallels [[U.S. Route 3]]. Particularly in [[New Hampshire]], the two highways have several interchanges with each other, as well as a concurrency through [[Franconia Notch State Park]]. I-93 follows the '''Southeast Expressway''' south of downtown Boston, the [[Central Artery]] through Boston, and the '''Northern Expressway''' from Boston to the New Hampshire state line.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths_table|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" /><ref name=\"NHDOT Roads\" /><ref name=\"VT Route Log\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (Massachusetts)|MA]]\n|{{convert|46.25|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (New Hampshire)|NH]]\n|{{convert|131.764|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (Vermont)|VT]]\n|{{convert|11.104|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|Total\n|{{convert|189.118|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Massachusetts===\n{{seealso|Central Artery}}\n[[File:End Interstate 93 in Canton, MA.JPG|thumb|left|Southern terminus of I-93 in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton, MA]]]]\nInterstate 93's southern terminus is at exit 12 of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] North. At this junction, I-95 North heads to the northwest (co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1]] South, as well as [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], which begins at the interchange), to serve as the beltway around Boston, while I-95 South runs by itself southwest through Boston's southwestern suburbs toward [[Rhode Island]]. This violates the numbering plan for the [[Interstate Highway System|highway system of the United States]], which dictates that the signed number for odd-numbered interstates increase from west to east, and therefore I-95 should be farther east than I-93.\n\nThe southernmost {{convert|3|mi}} of I-93 run east through Boston's southern suburbs, passing through Canton and [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]. In Randolph, I-93 meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] (Fall River Expressway/AMVETS Memorial Highway) at Exit 4. I-93 continues east into [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]], the major freeway linking Boston to [[Cape Cod]], at Exit 7 (known locally as the \"[[Braintree Split]]\"). Route 3 North joins I-93 and US-1, and the highway turns north toward Boston. These first {{convert|7|mi}} of I-93 follows what was formerly part of [[Massachusetts Route 128]] before it was truncated at the I-95/I-93 junction and many locals still{{when|date=December 2019}} refer to this section of roadway as part of Route 128.\n\n[[Image:Boston Signs.jpg|222px|thumb|right|Signs in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] of Boston point toward [[Downtown Crossing]], [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], Interstate 93, and [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Interstate 90]].]]\nUpon turning northward, the highway is known as the Southeast Expressway passing through [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] before crossing into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[Neponset River]]. After the [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] connector exit, the highway officially becomes the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]], which is also known as the [[Central Artery]], and passes beneath downtown Boston. A major intersection with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]/Interstate 90 (Exit 20) takes place just south of downtown Boston. After the massive interchange, motorists use the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] to travel underneath the city and then use [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. Two exits are located in the tunnel, where the speed limit is {{convert|45|mi|km}} an hour. [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] leaves the Artery just before the Zakim bridge via Exit 26, and [[U.S. Route 1]] leaves the Artery just after the bridge, via Exit 27 (no southbound access). From Boston through the rest of Massachusetts, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord, NH]] appears as the control city on northbound overhead signs. The Artery ends as I-93 continues north out of the city.\n\nI-93 continues through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming in [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] to a second intersection with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] and Route 128, which run in a concurrency. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach [[Maine]], or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], I-93 meets [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]], providing access to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] to the southwest and New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast region]] to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the [[Merrimack River]] into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]], where it interchanges with Routes [[Massachusetts Route 110|110]] and [[Massachusetts Route 113|113]] at exit 46 just north of the river crossing. Prior to August 2016, the Route 110 and 113 junction beneath I-93 was a [[traffic circle|rotary]], but current{{when|date=December 2019}} construction routes the highways straight under I-93. While two new ramps are being built at the interchange to complete the new [[partial cloverleaf]] format, there are [http://methuenrotary.mhd.state.ma.us/updates/traffic.aspx temporary signals and inlets] at the end of two existing ramps to serve traffic that will soon be using the new loop ramps. Work began in July 2014, on the project, and with the rotary closed, demolition of the rotary will be underway in late 2016.{{update inline|date=December 2019}} The full project is scheduled for completion in June 2018.<ref name=\"Methuen Rotary Project: Home\">{{cite web|title=Methuen Rotary Project: Home|url=http://methuenrotary.mhd.state.ma.us|publisher=[[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT)|accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>{{update inline|date=December 2019}} I-93 then interchanges with the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 213|Route 213]], a connector between I-93 and I-495. I-93 then crosses into [[New Hampshire]] after about {{convert|1|mi}}.\n\nIn all, I-93 has 48 numbered exits in Massachusetts, although several numbers are skipped in and near Boston. One noteworthy reason that some exits were removed from I-93 is to further address traffic problems in addition to converting the Central Artery from six to eight to ten lanes, by reducing the combined number of on- and off-ramps from 27 to 14.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/facts_figures.aspx#traffic| title=404| publisher=[[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]]| accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>{{cn|date=February 2020}} Exit 48 in Methuen, just before the New Hampshire state line, is the highest-numbered exit along the entire route.

Serving as the main interstate route in New Hampshire, it connects the state capital, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], and its largest city, [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. Beyond Concord are the towns of [[Tilton, New Hampshire|Tilton]], [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], and [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]]. I-93 is designated as the [[Alan B. Shepard]] Highway,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-93S_NH/|title=Alan B Shepard Highway (I-93)|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> from the Massachusetts line to [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] (just north of Manchester at the northern terminus of I-293), as the [[F.E. Everett Turnpike]] from Hooksett to Concord, and as the [[Styles Bridges]] Highway from Concord to the Vermont line. This section of roadway was constructed between 1961 and 1977.\n\nBetween the northern end of [[Interstate 293|I-293]] in Hooksett and the beginning of [[Interstate 89|I-89]] in [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]], I-93 also carries the northern end of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. There is one toll booth along this section, at Exit 11 in Hooksett; the toll for passenger cars is $1 (50\u00a2 at the ramp toll booth). This is the only toll collected along the entire length of Interstate 93. I-93 in New Hampshire is also notable for having state liquor stores serve as rest areas, which are passed just after the toll plaza, traveling north. There are separate stores on both sides of the Interstate for travelers in each direction.\n\nI-93 enters New Hampshire at [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]]. A rest area/welcome center is available on the northbound side of the freeway, directly before Exit 1. I-93 remains three lanes wide in each direction for its first {{convert|7|mi|km}}, until after the exit 3 interchange in Windham. It then drops to two lanes until the split with [[Interstate 293]] and the junction with [[New Hampshire Route 101]] add a third and fourth lane back to the freeway. I-93 and New Hampshire Route 101 run concurrently for about {{convert|1|mi}} before New Hampshire Route 101 heads directly east as its own freeway, serving Portsmouth and the Seacoast region. I-93 keeps three lanes of traffic in each direction until the junction with [[Interstate 89]], when each side reduces back to two, and remains a four-lane freeway through most of its journey northward, with the only exception being the [[Franconia Notch]] section.\n[[Image:I-93 Franconia Notch.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound lane of Interstate 93/US Route 3 in Franconia Notch]]\nIt crosses the [[Merrimack River]] again before going through the state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. In Concord, [[Interstate 393]] heads directly east (co-signed with eastbound [[U.S. Route 4]] and [[U.S. Route 202]]), providing another route to the Seacoast region. Westbound U.S. Route 4 joins I-93 and runs concurrently with it until Exit 17 for Penacook, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} further north, before exiting westward. Continuing north, I-93 traverses the [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] tourist region and makes its way north through the heart of the [[White Mountains Region]]. I-93 passes through [[Franconia Notch State Park]] as a [[Super two|Super-2]] parkway (one lane in each direction) with a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5}} speed limit, designed to reduce I-93's impact on Franconia Notch. For the trip through Franconia Notch, I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3]] run concurrently.\n\nBeyond Franconia Notch State Park, U.S. 3 heads northeastward through the [[Great North Woods Region (New Hampshire)|Great North Woods region]], while I-93 runs to the northwest. The final town along I-93 in New Hampshire is [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], served by four exits. Many motorist services are available at Exit 42. After passing through town, it crosses the [[Connecticut River]] into [[Vermont]]. The last exit along I-93 is exit 44 for [[Monroe, New Hampshire|Monroe]], through which a rest area/welcome center is accessible to travelers on both sides of the highway.\n\nIn 2013, a bill was signed by governor [[Maggie Hassan]] to raise the speed limit on Interstate 93 to {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} from mile marker 45 to the Vermont border. The new limit took effect on January 1, 2014.\n\n===Vermont===\n[[Image:I93 stjohnsbury vt 20080920.jpg|thumb|right|Southbound I-93 at Hudson Road, [[St. Johnsbury, VT]]]]\n\nInterstate 93 runs for {{convert|11|mi|km}} in [[Vermont]], with one numbered exit in the state before ending at the interchange with [[Interstate 91]] in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]] in the [[Northeast Kingdom]] of Vermont. A rest area/welcome center is located along the northbound side of the highway for travelers entering from New Hampshire. The final {{convert|3|mi}} of the Interstate, just before its terminus, actually veer to the southwest. Vehicles bound for Canada can use northbound I-91 to reach the Derby Line/Stanstead border crossing at that Interstate's end, and [[Quebec Autoroute 55|northwards into Canada]] as an \"autoroute\" freeway into the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. The portion of I-93 in Vermont parallels both [[U.S. Route 2]] and [[Vermont Route 18]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Southeast Expressway===\nThe Southeast Expressway was constructed between 1954 and 1959, at the same time the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]] (Central Artery) was built. Its northern terminus is at Exit 18 (Massachusetts Avenue) in South Boston, a former Y-interchange where the cancelled [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] (I-695) was to meet with the expressway and the Central Artery. The southern terminus is at the Y-interchange (the \"[[Braintree Split]]\") at Exit 7 in Braintree (the former southern terminus of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]). A section of the Expressway, beginning south of the Savin Hill overpass and ending just before the Braintree Split utilizes a [[zipper lane]], in which a movable barrier carves out a reversible [[high occupancy vehicle lane]] on the non-peak side of the highway during [[rush hour]]. Most of the right of way for the [[Granite Railway]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] was incorporated into the expressway.<ref name=Crane>{{cite web|title=The Successor Railroads|url=http://thomascranelibrary.org/legacy/chap9.htm|publisher=[[Thomas Crane Library]]|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Boston===\n{{further|John F.

Fitzgerald Expressway]], was a section of highway in downtown Boston constructed in the 1950s and was originally designed as a fully elevated highway. This new highway was greatly disliked by the citizens of the city because it cut the heart of the city in half, cast long, dreary shadows and was an eyesore to the community. Because of the public outcry, Gov. [[John Volpe]] ordered the southern half of the highway redesigned so that it was underground; this section became known as the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. With the cancellation of the highway projects leading into the city in 1972 by Gov. [[Francis W. Sargent]], the Central Artery gained the designation of Interstate 93 in 1974. It has also carried the local highway designations of [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] (since 1989) and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]].\n\nBy the mid-1970s, I-93 had outgrown its capacity and had begun to deteriorate due a lack of maintenance. State Transportation Secretary [[Frederick P. Salvucci]], aware of the issues surrounding the elevated roadway, proposed a plan conceived in the early 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery with a new, more efficient underground roadway. This plan was merged with a long-standing proposal to build a third harbor tunnel to alleviate congestion in the [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] and [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] tunnels to [[East Boston]]; the new plan became known as the Central Artery/Tunnel Project or the ''Big Dig''.\n\nThese new roadways were built during a twelve-year period from 1994 to early 2006. The massive project became the largest urban construction project ever undertaken in American history.<ref name=\"The Associated Press\">{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html | title=Review Begins After Big Dig Tunnel Collapse |publisher=CNN | date=July 12, 2006 | accessdate=July 25, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715075257/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html |archivedate = July 15, 2006}}</ref> Construction on the new I-93 segment was not without serious issues: a lengthy Federal environmental review pushed the start of construction back from approximately 1990, causing many inflationary increases; funding for the project was the subject of several political battles between Pres. [[Ronald Reagan]] and Rep. [[Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr]]. Major construction on the new roadway was done while maintaining the old roadway, a step that also greatly increased the cost of the project. The original [[Charles River]] crossing, named Scheme Z, was the object to great public outcry similar to that of the building of the original highway. The outcry eventually led to the replacement of Scheme Z with a newer, more sleek [[cable-stayed bridge]] and complementing exit for [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], increasing the cost even more.\n\nIn Downtown Boston, I-93 is made up of the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] and the [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]], which spans the Charles River. The underground construction of the tunnel system was completed as of October 2006; however, repairs continue to many parts of the tunnel due to water leakage because of improper construction of the [[slurry wall]]s supporting the O'Neill tunnel. The former route of the above-ground Artery, so named \"the other [[Green Monster]]\" by Mayor [[Thomas Menino]], was replaced mostly by open space known formally as the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAdditional improvements were done in the [[South Bay, Boston|South Bay]] section of the highway: The I-90/I-93 interchange was completely redesigned, a new [[HOV lane]] extending from the zipper lane in Quincy was added and the South Boston Haul road that was constructed to bypass truck traffic around residential streets in the South End is open to general traffic.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nHazardous cargoes are prohibited from I-93 in Boston due to safety issues in the tunnels; these cargoes must exit at either the [[Leverett Circle]] connector when traveling southbound or at the Massachusetts Ave. exit when traveling northbound.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|Massachusetts Turnpike|John F. Fitzgerald|Rose Kennedy|Leonard P. Zakim|Bunker Hill Monument}}\n\n===Northern Expressway===\nThe Northern Expressway was constructed from [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] to the New Hampshire border between 1956 and 1963. It was extended through [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to the [[Central Artery]], [[U.S. Route 1]], and the planned route of the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] between 1965 and 1973. Because it was already under construction, the highway was granted an exception to the moratorium on highway expansion inside Route 128 which was announced in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/northern/|title=Northern Expressway (I-93)|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nI-93's original southern terminus was in Cambridge (just north of Boston) where it was to meet the Inner Belt (I-695). However, when that route was canceled, and the I-95 section into Boston was canceled and rerouted along [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in the mid-1970s, I-93's route was extended an additional {{convert|18|mi|km}} down the Central Artery (which had been signed as a concurrency of I-95/MA-3 before I-95 was rerouted) and the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]] (what was then just [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) from Boston to [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] and then west along former Route 128 to its intersection with I-95 in Canton.\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate rush-hour traffic jams, travel in the [[breakdown lane]] of I-93 is permitted on a small stretch between Exit 41 and Exit 47/48. This extra travel is permitted on the southbound side on weekdays between 6AM and 10AM, and on the northbound side between 3PM and 7PM. However, on most busy days this fails to prevent traffic delays. The Massachusetts State Police is displeased with this arrangement, citing that traffic in the breakdown lanes interferes with the ability of emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Rapid bridge replacement project====\nIn August 2010, in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], a {{convert|25|x|7|ft|adj=on}} section of bridge deck on the northbound side partially collapsed due to age-related structural fatigue.<ref name=\"globe-moskowitz2\">{{cite news|last=Moskowitz |first=Eric |title=Officials expect I-93 north lanes in Medford to be open for a.m. commute |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/pothole_forces.html|accessdate=August 5, 2010|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref> The collapse forced the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] to evaluate the remaining bridges along the corridor, eventually deciding to replace several bridges along the highway in a plan called 93 Fast 14. The MassDOT set in motion a plan to replace the superstructure and concrete decks on 14 overpass bridges along that section of the interstate, using [[rapid bridge replacement]] methods. The $98.1 million project replaced bridges originally built in 1957 with a set of prefabricated modular concrete bridges in a series of weekend roadway closures. Traffic was diverted into a series of crossover lanes during construction. The main part of the project took place each weekend from June through August 2011,with the exception of the July 4th holiday weekend. One or two bridges were replaced each weekend during the construction time frame. The project was part of the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program.<ref>{{cite web |title=I-93 Medford Bridges: 93Fast14 Video |url=http://transportation.blog.state.ma.us/blog/2011/05/i-93-medford-bridges-93fast14-video.html|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |date=May 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MassDot Accelerated Bridge Program: About the program |url=http://93fast14.dot.state.ma.us/about.html |publisher=[[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608201046/http://93fast14.dot.state.ma.us/about.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Methuen Rotary====\nOff exit 46 in [[Methuen, Massachusetts]], the surface level traffic circle was rebuilt as part of an overall infrastructure improvement that included a new 8-lane bridge for I-93.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===New Hampshire===\nExit 1 in Salem was originally designed and built with ramps allowing northbound traffic to exit to [[Rockingham Park]] and return drivers to southbound 93 only. The complementary ramps were added much later, with the southbound off ramp being a particularly tight and dangerous turn squeezed within the curve of the southbound on ramp, which was replaced in August 2012.\n\nA {{convert|7.6|mi|0|sing=on}} section of I-93 through [[Franconia Notch State Park]], called the '''Franconia Notch Parkway''', was constructed as a [[two-lane freeway]] with a median divider. This was built as a compromise between the state's park department and highway officials. The speed limit on the parkway is {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}}. Originally, this section's signage read \"U.S. 3 TO I-93\", complete with its own exit number sequence, but this has since been replaced by I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3|US-3]] signage along the entire length of the parkway. The exits were renumbered to Exit 34A, 34B, and 34C.

The largest cities along its route are [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], and [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. It also passes through the New Hampshire state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].\n\nFor most of its length, I-93 indirectly parallels [[U.S. Route 3]]. Particularly in [[New Hampshire]], the two highways have several interchanges with each other, as well as a concurrency through [[Franconia Notch State Park]]. I-93 follows the '''Southeast Expressway''' south of downtown Boston, the [[Central Artery]] through Boston, and the '''Northern Expressway''' from Boston to the New Hampshire state line.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths_table|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" /><ref name=\"NHDOT Roads\" /><ref name=\"VT Route Log\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (Massachusetts)|MA]]\n|{{convert|46.25|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (New Hampshire)|NH]]\n|{{convert|131.764|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 93 (Vermont)|VT]]\n|{{convert|11.104|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|Total\n|{{convert|189.118|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Massachusetts===\n{{seealso|Central Artery}}\n[[File:End Interstate 93 in Canton, MA.JPG|thumb|left|Southern terminus of I-93 in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton, MA]]]]\nInterstate 93's southern terminus is at exit 12 of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] North. At this junction, I-95 North heads to the northwest (co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1]] South, as well as [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], which begins at the interchange), to serve as the beltway around Boston, while I-95 South runs by itself southwest through Boston's southwestern suburbs toward [[Rhode Island]]. This violates the numbering plan for the [[Interstate Highway System|highway system of the United States]], which dictates that the signed number for odd-numbered interstates increase from west to east, and therefore I-95 should be farther east than I-93.\n\nThe southernmost {{convert|3|mi}} of I-93 run east through Boston's southern suburbs, passing through Canton and [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]. In Randolph, I-93 meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] (Fall River Expressway/AMVETS Memorial Highway) at Exit 4. I-93 continues east into [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]], the major freeway linking Boston to [[Cape Cod]], at Exit 7 (known locally as the \"[[Braintree Split]]\"). Route 3 North joins I-93 and US-1, and the highway turns north toward Boston. These first {{convert|7|mi}} of I-93 follows what was formerly part of [[Massachusetts Route 128]] before it was truncated at the I-95/I-93 junction and many locals still{{when|date=December 2019}} refer to this section of roadway as part of Route 128.\n\n[[Image:Boston Signs.jpg|222px|thumb|right|Signs in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] of Boston point toward [[Downtown Crossing]], [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], Interstate 93, and [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Interstate 90]].]]\nUpon turning northward, the highway is known as the Southeast Expressway passing through [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] before crossing into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[Neponset River]]. After the [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] connector exit, the highway officially becomes the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]], which is also known as the [[Central Artery]], and passes beneath downtown Boston. A major intersection with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]/Interstate 90 (Exit 20) takes place just south of downtown Boston. After the massive interchange, motorists use the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] to travel underneath the city and then use [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. Two exits are located in the tunnel, where the speed limit is {{convert|45|mi|km}} an hour. [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] leaves the Artery just before the Zakim bridge via Exit 26, and [[U.S. Route 1]] leaves the Artery just after the bridge, via Exit 27 (no southbound access). From Boston through the rest of Massachusetts, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord, NH]] appears as the control city on northbound overhead signs. The Artery ends as I-93 continues north out of the city.\n\nI-93 continues through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming in [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] to a second intersection with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] and Route 128, which run in a concurrency. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach [[Maine]], or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], I-93 meets [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]], providing access to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] to the southwest and New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast region]] to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the [[Merrimack River]] into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]], where it interchanges with Routes [[Massachusetts Route 110|110]] and [[Massachusetts Route 113|113]] at exit 46 just north of the river crossing. Prior to August 2016, the Route 110 and 113 junction beneath I-93 was a [[traffic circle|rotary]], but current{{when|date=December 2019}} construction routes the highways straight under I-93.

Serving as the main interstate route in New Hampshire, it connects the state capital, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], and its largest city, [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. Beyond Concord are the towns of [[Tilton, New Hampshire|Tilton]], [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], and [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]]. I-93 is designated as the [[Alan B. Shepard]] Highway,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-93S_NH/|title=Alan B Shepard Highway (I-93)|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> from the Massachusetts line to [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] (just north of Manchester at the northern terminus of I-293), as the [[F.E. Everett Turnpike]] from Hooksett to Concord, and as the [[Styles Bridges]] Highway from Concord to the Vermont line. This section of roadway was constructed between 1961 and 1977.\n\nBetween the northern end of [[Interstate 293|I-293]] in Hooksett and the beginning of [[Interstate 89|I-89]] in [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]], I-93 also carries the northern end of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. There is one toll booth along this section, at Exit 11 in Hooksett; the toll for passenger cars is $1 (50\u00a2 at the ramp toll booth). This is the only toll collected along the entire length of Interstate 93. I-93 in New Hampshire is also notable for having state liquor stores serve as rest areas, which are passed just after the toll plaza, traveling north. There are separate stores on both sides of the Interstate for travelers in each direction.\n\nI-93 enters New Hampshire at [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]]. A rest area/welcome center is available on the northbound side of the freeway, directly before Exit 1. I-93 remains three lanes wide in each direction for its first {{convert|7|mi|km}}, until after the exit 3 interchange in Windham. It then drops to two lanes until the split with [[Interstate 293]] and the junction with [[New Hampshire Route 101]] add a third and fourth lane back to the freeway. I-93 and New Hampshire Route 101 run concurrently for about {{convert|1|mi}} before New Hampshire Route 101 heads directly east as its own freeway, serving Portsmouth and the Seacoast region. I-93 keeps three lanes of traffic in each direction until the junction with [[Interstate 89]], when each side reduces back to two, and remains a four-lane freeway through most of its journey northward, with the only exception being the [[Franconia Notch]] section.\n[[Image:I-93 Franconia Notch.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound lane of Interstate 93/US Route 3 in Franconia Notch]]\nIt crosses the [[Merrimack River]] again before going through the state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. In Concord, [[Interstate 393]] heads directly east (co-signed with eastbound [[U.S. Route 4]] and [[U.S. Route 202]]), providing another route to the Seacoast region. Westbound U.S. Route 4 joins I-93 and runs concurrently with it until Exit 17 for Penacook, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} further north, before exiting westward. Continuing north, I-93 traverses the [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] tourist region and makes its way north through the heart of the [[White Mountains Region]]. I-93 passes through [[Franconia Notch State Park]] as a [[Super two|Super-2]] parkway (one lane in each direction) with a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5}} speed limit, designed to reduce I-93's impact on Franconia Notch. For the trip through Franconia Notch, I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3]] run concurrently.\n\nBeyond Franconia Notch State Park, U.S. 3 heads northeastward through the [[Great North Woods Region (New Hampshire)|Great North Woods region]], while I-93 runs to the northwest. The final town along I-93 in New Hampshire is [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], served by four exits. Many motorist services are available at Exit 42. After passing through town, it crosses the [[Connecticut River]] into [[Vermont]]. The last exit along I-93 is exit 44 for [[Monroe, New Hampshire|Monroe]], through which a rest area/welcome center is accessible to travelers on both sides of the highway.\n\nIn 2013, a bill was signed by governor [[Maggie Hassan]] to raise the speed limit on Interstate 93 to {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} from mile marker 45 to the Vermont border. The new limit took effect on January 1, 2014.\n\n===Vermont===\n[[Image:I93 stjohnsbury vt 20080920.jpg|thumb|right|Southbound I-93 at Hudson Road, [[St. Johnsbury, VT]]]]\n\nInterstate 93 runs for {{convert|11|mi|km}} in [[Vermont]], with one numbered exit in the state before ending at the interchange with [[Interstate 91]] in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]] in the [[Northeast Kingdom]] of Vermont. A rest area/welcome center is located along the northbound side of the highway for travelers entering from New Hampshire. The final {{convert|3|mi}} of the Interstate, just before its terminus, actually veer to the southwest. Vehicles bound for Canada can use northbound I-91 to reach the Derby Line/Stanstead border crossing at that Interstate's end, and [[Quebec Autoroute 55|northwards into Canada]] as an \"autoroute\" freeway into the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. The portion of I-93 in Vermont parallels both [[U.S. Route 2]] and [[Vermont Route 18]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Southeast Expressway===\nThe Southeast Expressway was constructed between 1954 and 1959, at the same time the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]] (Central Artery) was built. Its northern terminus is at Exit 18 (Massachusetts Avenue) in South Boston, a former Y-interchange where the cancelled [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] (I-695) was to meet with the expressway and the Central Artery. The southern terminus is at the Y-interchange (the \"[[Braintree Split]]\") at Exit 7 in Braintree (the former southern terminus of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]). A section of the Expressway, beginning south of the Savin Hill overpass and ending just before the Braintree Split utilizes a [[zipper lane]], in which a movable barrier carves out a reversible [[high occupancy vehicle lane]] on the non-peak side of the highway during [[rush hour]]. Most of the right of way for the [[Granite Railway]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] was incorporated into the expressway.<ref name=Crane>{{cite web|title=The Successor Railroads|url=http://thomascranelibrary.org/legacy/chap9.htm|publisher=[[Thomas Crane Library]]|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Boston===\n{{further|John F.

Fitzgerald Expressway]], was a section of highway in downtown Boston constructed in the 1950s and was originally designed as a fully elevated highway. This new highway was greatly disliked by the citizens of the city because it cut the heart of the city in half, cast long, dreary shadows and was an eyesore to the community. Because of the public outcry, Gov. [[John Volpe]] ordered the southern half of the highway redesigned so that it was underground; this section became known as the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. With the cancellation of the highway projects leading into the city in 1972 by Gov. [[Francis W. Sargent]], the Central Artery gained the designation of Interstate 93 in 1974. It has also carried the local highway designations of [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] (since 1989) and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]].\n\nBy the mid-1970s, I-93 had outgrown its capacity and had begun to deteriorate due a lack of maintenance. State Transportation Secretary [[Frederick P. Salvucci]], aware of the issues surrounding the elevated roadway, proposed a plan conceived in the early 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery with a new, more efficient underground roadway. This plan was merged with a long-standing proposal to build a third harbor tunnel to alleviate congestion in the [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] and [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] tunnels to [[East Boston]]; the new plan became known as the Central Artery/Tunnel Project or the ''Big Dig''.\n\nThese new roadways were built during a twelve-year period from 1994 to early 2006. The massive project became the largest urban construction project ever undertaken in American history.<ref name=\"The Associated Press\">{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html | title=Review Begins After Big Dig Tunnel Collapse |publisher=CNN | date=July 12, 2006 | accessdate=July 25, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715075257/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html |archivedate = July 15, 2006}}</ref> Construction on the new I-93 segment was not without serious issues: a lengthy Federal environmental review pushed the start of construction back from approximately 1990, causing many inflationary increases; funding for the project was the subject of several political battles between Pres. [[Ronald Reagan]] and Rep. [[Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr]]. Major construction on the new roadway was done while maintaining the old roadway, a step that also greatly increased the cost of the project. The original [[Charles River]] crossing, named Scheme Z, was the object to great public outcry similar to that of the building of the original highway. The outcry eventually led to the replacement of Scheme Z with a newer, more sleek [[cable-stayed bridge]] and complementing exit for [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], increasing the cost even more.\n\nIn Downtown Boston, I-93 is made up of the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] and the [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]], which spans the Charles River. The underground construction of the tunnel system was completed as of October 2006; however, repairs continue to many parts of the tunnel due to water leakage because of improper construction of the [[slurry wall]]s supporting the O'Neill tunnel. The former route of the above-ground Artery, so named \"the other [[Green Monster]]\" by Mayor [[Thomas Menino]], was replaced mostly by open space known formally as the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAdditional improvements were done in the [[South Bay, Boston|South Bay]] section of the highway: The I-90/I-93 interchange was completely redesigned, a new [[HOV lane]] extending from the zipper lane in Quincy was added and the South Boston Haul road that was constructed to bypass truck traffic around residential streets in the South End is open to general traffic.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nHazardous cargoes are prohibited from I-93 in Boston due to safety issues in the tunnels; these cargoes must exit at either the [[Leverett Circle]] connector when traveling southbound or at the Massachusetts Ave. exit when traveling northbound.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{see also|Massachusetts Turnpike|John F. Fitzgerald|Rose Kennedy|Leonard P. Zakim|Bunker Hill Monument}}\n\n===Northern Expressway===\nThe Northern Expressway was constructed from [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] to the New Hampshire border between 1956 and 1963. It was extended through [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to the [[Central Artery]], [[U.S. Route 1]], and the planned route of the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] between 1965 and 1973. Because it was already under construction, the highway was granted an exception to the moratorium on highway expansion inside Route 128 which was announced in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/northern/|title=Northern Expressway (I-93)|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nI-93's original southern terminus was in Cambridge (just north of Boston) where it was to meet the Inner Belt (I-695). However, when that route was canceled, and the I-95 section into Boston was canceled and rerouted along [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in the mid-1970s, I-93's route was extended an additional {{convert|18|mi|km}} down the Central Artery (which had been signed as a concurrency of I-95/MA-3 before I-95 was rerouted) and the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]] (what was then just [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) from Boston to [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] and then west along former Route 128 to its intersection with I-95 in Canton.\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate rush-hour traffic jams, travel in the [[breakdown lane]] of I-93 is permitted on a small stretch between Exit 41 and Exit 47/48. This extra travel is permitted on the southbound side on weekdays between 6AM and 10AM, and on the northbound side between 3PM and 7PM. However, on most busy days this fails to prevent traffic delays. The Massachusetts State Police is displeased with this arrangement, citing that traffic in the breakdown lanes interferes with the ability of emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Rapid bridge replacement project====\nIn August 2010, in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], a {{convert|25|x|7|ft|adj=on}} section of bridge deck on the northbound side partially collapsed due to age-related structural fatigue.<ref name=\"globe-moskowitz2\">{{cite news|last=Moskowitz |first=Eric |title=Officials expect I-93 north lanes in Medford to be open for a.m. commute |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/pothole_forces.html|accessdate=August 5, 2010|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref> The collapse forced the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] to evaluate the remaining bridges along the corridor, eventually deciding to replace several bridges along the highway in a plan called 93 Fast 14. The MassDOT set in motion a plan to replace the superstructure and concrete decks on 14 overpass bridges along that section of the interstate, using [[rapid bridge replacement]] methods. The $98.1 million project replaced bridges originally built in 1957 with a set of prefabricated modular concrete bridges in a series of weekend roadway closures. Traffic was diverted into a series of crossover lanes during construction. The main part of the project took place each weekend from June through August 2011,with the exception of the July 4th holiday weekend. One or two bridges were replaced each weekend during the construction time frame. The project was part of the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program.<ref>{{cite web |title=I-93 Medford Bridges: 93Fast14 Video |url=http://transportation.blog.state.ma.us/blog/2011/05/i-93-medford-bridges-93fast14-video.html|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |date=May 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MassDot Accelerated Bridge Program: About the program |url=http://93fast14.dot.state.ma.us/about.html |publisher=[[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608201046/http://93fast14.dot.state.ma.us/about.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Methuen Rotary====\nOff exit 46 in [[Methuen, Massachusetts]], the surface level traffic circle was rebuilt as part of an overall infrastructure improvement that included a new 8-lane bridge for I-93.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===New Hampshire===\nExit 1 in Salem was originally designed and built with ramps allowing northbound traffic to exit to [[Rockingham Park]] and return drivers to southbound 93 only.

Originally, this section's signage read \"U.S. 3 TO I-93\", complete with its own exit number sequence, but this has since been replaced by I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3|US-3]] signage along the entire length of the parkway.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

He will be missed by all those who had the good fortune to know him, but his contributions to education, to civil rights, and to the United States will live on.\"<ref name=\"Garibaldi xi\"/>\n\n== Selected works ==\n* {{cite journal |year = 1934 |title = Land-Grant Colleges for Negroes | journal = West Virginia State College Bulletin|publisher = [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] |location = [[Institute, West Virginia]] | oclc = 990436113 }}<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\u20137\"/><ref name=\"Beckley Post-Herald 1\"/>\n* {{cite journal |year = 1937 |title = Problems in the Collegiate Education of Negroes | journal = West Virginia State College Bulletin |publisher = [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] |location = [[Institute, West Virginia]] | oclc = 702710779 | volume = 24 | issue = 4}}<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\"/>\n* {{cite journal |date = March 1950 |title = The Unfinished Business of Great Teaching | journal = The American College Bulletin| oclc = 990504725 }}<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last = Bardolph |first = Richard |author-link = |year = 1959 |title = The Negro Vanguard |publisher = [[Rinehart & Company|Rinehart & Company, Inc.]] |location = New York |isbn =  | oclc = 1036799256 |url = https://archive.org/details/negrovanguard00bard/ |accessdate = |via = [[Internet Archive]] | lccn = 59006571 }}\n* {{cite book |last1 = Bickley |first1 = Ancella Radford | last2 = Collins | first2 = Rodney S. |date = June 1988 | author-link1 = Ancella Radford Bickley | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory \u2013 Nomination Form: East Hall |publisher = [[United States Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]] |url = http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/kanawha/88001585.pdf |access-date = 2 March 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302223753/http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/kanawha/88001585.pdf |archive-date = 2 March 2020 }}\n* {{cite book |last1 = Collins |first1 = Rodney S. | last2 = Turley | first2 = C.

Surrounded by the [[Ouachita National Forest]], Mena is a gateway to some of the most visited tourist attractions in Arkansas.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Mena, Arkansas -1907.jpg|thumb|Mena, 1907]]\n[[File:Mountain Fork Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright|The Mountain Fork Bridge, eleven miles southwest of Mena, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Polk County, Arkansas|National Register of Historic Places]]]]\n[[File:Railroad Depot, Mena, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|Depot in Mena]]\nMena was founded by [[Arthur Edward Stilwell]] during the building of the [[Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad]] (now the [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern]]), which stretched from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to [[Port Arthur, Texas]].  Train service to Mena began in 1896.\n\nStilwell named the town in honor of Folmina Margaretha Janssen-De Goeijen, the wife of his friend and financier Jan [[De Queen, Arkansas|De Goeijen]], whom Mr. De Goeijen affectionately called Mena. [[Janssen Park]] in the center of Mena is also named for her.\n\nMena was settled in 1896 and incorporated on September 18 of that year. In 1897, the Bank of Mena was founded.  The following year, the county seat was moved from nearby [[Dallas, Arkansas|Dallas]] to Mena. Mena's population had grown to 3,423 by 1900. The main industries of the area were timber, agriculture and mineral extraction, though it was advertised as a spa city located within a healthy environment. Stilwell donated land to the city in 1906, and a park and campground were constructed. In 1910, the railroad moved its shop facilities from Mena to [[Heavener, Oklahoma|Heavener]], [[Oklahoma]]. This created a loss of eight hundred jobs. A private school in Mena, Hendrix Academy, closed in 1905.\n\nIn 1911, a damaging [[tornado]] struck the town.<ref name=\"Lancaster\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lancaster | first = Guy | title = Mena (Polk County) | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture | date = 2012 | url = http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=959}}</ref>\n\n===Sundown town===\nA black community called Little Africa developed on Board Camp Creek east of Mena.  The community was small, with a population of 152 in 1900.\n\nIn 1901, a black man, Peter Berryman, was lynched after an alleged altercation with a white girl. No one was arrested for the crime.<ref name=\"Berryman\">{{cite web|title=Peter Berryman (Lynching of)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=8495|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>  Several other instances of racially motivated hate and violence towards Mena's black community had been noted.  This, combined with declining job prospects after the railway shops left town, led many blacks to leave Mena.  By 1910, just 16 remained.\n\n''The Mena Star'' advertised the town as being \"100% white\" in its March 18, 1920 edition, and a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was organized in 1922.  In 1927, the Mena Commercial Club created advertisements which stated that Mena, in addition to having \"pure soft water\" and \"beautiful scenery\", also had \"no Negroes\".\n\nLike many other communities in Arkansas, Mena had become a [[sundown town]].  In the 2010 census, 0.2% of Mena's population was black.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn the 1950s, a government program to stockpile [[manganese]] led to the reopening of local mines closed since the 1890s.  The program ended in 1959, and the mines again closed.<ref name=\"Lancaster\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, drug smuggler [[Barry Seal]] moved his operations to the [[Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport]], where he owned and operated many planes and helicopters, as well as advanced radar equipment.<ref name=\"Lancaster\"/>\n\nOn April 9, 2009, a large and violent [[April 2009 tornado outbreak|tornado]] devastated the town, killing three and injuring thirty.<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8449156|title=Tornado Devastates Small Arkansas Town, Killing 3 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-05-20|location=London|date=January 23, 2008}}</ref> Many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.

The gallery is a non-profit organization which exhibits about 12 shows a year ranging from invitational to open shows featuring primarily local artists in a variety of media.

Surrounded by the [[Ouachita National Forest]], Mena is a gateway to some of the most visited tourist attractions in Arkansas.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Mena, Arkansas -1907.jpg|thumb|Mena, 1907]]\n[[File:Mountain Fork Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright|The Mountain Fork Bridge, eleven miles southwest of Mena, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Polk County, Arkansas|National Register of Historic Places]]]]\n[[File:Railroad Depot, Mena, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|Depot in Mena]]\nMena was founded by [[Arthur Edward Stilwell]] during the building of the [[Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad]] (now the [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern]]), which stretched from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to [[Port Arthur, Texas]].  Train service to Mena began in 1896.\n\nStilwell named the town in honor of Folmina Margaretha Janssen-De Goeijen, the wife of his friend and financier Jan [[De Queen, Arkansas|De Goeijen]], whom Mr. De Goeijen affectionately called Mena. [[Janssen Park]] in the center of Mena is also named for her.\n\nMena was settled in 1896 and incorporated on September 18 of that year. In 1897, the Bank of Mena was founded.  The following year, the county seat was moved from nearby [[Dallas, Arkansas|Dallas]] to Mena. Mena's population had grown to 3,423 by 1900. The main industries of the area were timber, agriculture and mineral extraction, though it was advertised as a spa city located within a healthy environment. Stilwell donated land to the city in 1906, and a park and campground were constructed. In 1910, the railroad moved its shop facilities from Mena to [[Heavener, Oklahoma|Heavener]], [[Oklahoma]]. This created a loss of eight hundred jobs. A private school in Mena, Hendrix Academy, closed in 1905.\n\nIn 1911, a damaging [[tornado]] struck the town.<ref name=\"Lancaster\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lancaster | first = Guy | title = Mena (Polk County) | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture | date = 2012 | url = http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=959}}</ref>\n\n===Sundown town===\nA black community called Little Africa developed on Board Camp Creek east of Mena.  The community was small, with a population of 152 in 1900.\n\nIn 1901, a black man, Peter Berryman, was lynched after an alleged altercation with a white girl. No one was arrested for the crime.<ref name=\"Berryman\">{{cite web|title=Peter Berryman (Lynching of)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=8495|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>  Several other instances of racially motivated hate and violence towards Mena's black community had been noted.  This, combined with declining job prospects after the railway shops left town, led many blacks to leave Mena.  By 1910, just 16 remained.\n\n''The Mena Star'' advertised the town as being \"100% white\" in its March 18, 1920 edition, and a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was organized in 1922.  In 1927, the Mena Commercial Club created advertisements which stated that Mena, in addition to having \"pure soft water\" and \"beautiful scenery\", also had \"no Negroes\".\n\nLike many other communities in Arkansas, Mena had become a [[sundown town]].  In the 2010 census, 0.2% of Mena's population was black.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn the 1950s, a government program to stockpile [[manganese]] led to the reopening of local mines closed since the 1890s.  The program ended in 1959, and the mines again closed.<ref name=\"Lancaster\"/>\n\nDuring the 1980s, drug smuggler [[Barry Seal]] moved his operations to the [[Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport]], where he owned and operated many planes and helicopters, as well as advanced radar equipment.<ref name=\"Lancaster\"/>\n\nOn April 9, 2009, a large and violent [[April 2009 tornado outbreak|tornado]] devastated the town, killing three and injuring thirty.<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8449156|title=Tornado Devastates Small Arkansas Town, Killing 3 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-05-20|location=London|date=January 23, 2008}}</ref> Many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.

The gallery is a non-profit organization which exhibits about 12 shows a year ranging from invitational to open shows featuring primarily local artists in a variety of media.
