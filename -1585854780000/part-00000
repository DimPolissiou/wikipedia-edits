While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the liberation of Tripolis, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Nafplion===\nHe next commanded Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]]. He took the port, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos.\n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the famous [[Acropolis]] in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. Dramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-Classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens.

Today, Kolokotronis ranks among the most prominent figures in Greece's War of Independence.\n\n==Early life==\nTheodoros Kolokotronis was born at Ramavouni ({{lang|el|\u03a1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9}}) in [[Messenia]], and was baptised in Piana, from a family of [[kleft]]s, and grew up in Arcadia in the central Peloponnese where his family originated.<ref name=Keridis>{{harvnb|Keridis|2009|loc=\"Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", pp. 94\u201395}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|National Herald|2001|loc=p. 132: \"Theodoros Kolokotronis (1770\u20131843) He came from a family of kleftes and escaped to the island of Zakynthos.\"}}</ref> The Kolokotroneoi were a powerful and respected clan in Arcadia in the 18th century. Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Turkish troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''kapos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805\u20131806, Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the liberation of Tripolis, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Nafplion===\nHe next commanded Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]]. He took the port, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos.\n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the famous [[Acropolis]] in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. Dramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-Classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Ibrahim's campaign===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. Kolokotronis used guerrilla tactics to wear Ibrahim's forces down; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis's weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Personal items of T.

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' deemed ''Reservoir Dogs'' the \"Greatest Independent Film of All Time\". His second film, ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), a comedy crime film, was a major success both among critics and audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207063,00.html |title=The New Classics: Movies |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b7c5c1618 |title=''Pulp Fiction'' (1994) |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref> He also wrote the screenplay for and starred in the vampire film ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'' (1996). Tarantino paid homage to the [[blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s with ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' (1997), an adaptation of [[Elmore Leonard]]'s novel ''[[Rum Punch]]''.\n\n''Kill Bill'', a highly stylized \"revenge flick\" in the cinematic traditions of [[kung fu film]]s, [[Kendo|Japanese martial arts]], and [[Spaghetti Western|spaghetti westerns]], followed six years later, and was released as two films: ''[[Kill Bill:<!--The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --> Volume 1|Volume 1]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Kill Bill:<!--The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-2/ --> Volume 2|Volume 2]]'' in 2004. Tarantino next directed the [[exploitation film|exploitation]] [[slasher film|slasher]] film ''[[Death Proof]]'' in 2007, as part of a [[double feature]] with [[Robert Rodriguez]], released in the tradition of [[grindhouse]] cinema of the 1970s under the collective title ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. His long-postponed ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', which tells an [[alternate history]] of [[Nazi Germany]], was released in 2009 to positive reviews. After that came critically acclaimed ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012), a [[Western (genre)|western]] film set in the [[Antebellum South]]. His eighth film, ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015), was released in its [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] version in [[70 mm film]] format, with opening \"[[overture]]\" and halfway-point [[intermission]].

The stadium has a capacity of 49,540 spectators, although it does not provide seating for all of them like most Argentine stadia.\n\nThe Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium is also the [[national stadium]] for the [[Argentina national rugby union team]] (''Los Pumas''). Although the team plays test matches throughout the country, their highest-profile tests (such as against the New Zealand All Blacks) are usually held here.\nThe newly formed Argentine [[Super Rugby]] team, [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Jaguares]], are playing its home games at the stadium.\n\n==History==\n===First years===\n[[File:Velez1920.png|thumb|right|Grandstands (wooden made) view of the first stadium]]\nDuring its first years of existence, V\u00e9lez Sarsfield football team played its games in vacant lands of the neighborhood, with removable goal posts. In 1913 the [[Argentine Football Association]] ordered the club to host its home games at a bigger stadium so the club moved to the Juan Mart\u00edn Figallo's (a neighbor) countryhouse on Rod\u00f3 and Escalada streets. Figallo rented the club part of his land.\n\nIn 1914, the club called an assembly to discuss the posibility to rent lands on better places. The club got a land behind Villa Luro station, between Cortina and Bacacay streest. But the definitive stadium would be built in 1922, when the club rented a land to L\u00f3pez Bancalari Brothers on Guardia Nacional street. The club started to built a grandstand while the team continued playing in Villa Luro and other fields, until the construction finished. Works were ready in 1924, when the club inaugurated its first stadium with a grandstand, lockers, coffee shop, personnel room and secretary. The stadium was officially opened in a friendly match v [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]].\n\nNew grandstands were built between 1926 and 1927, completing the four sides of the stadium and therefore increasing its capacity. In 1935, the first match with artificial lighting was played at V\u00e9lez Sarsfield venue. The local team defeated [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense|Platense]] 4\u20132. The end of an era came in 1940 when the club was intimated to leave the lands where the stadium was located due to the rental contract had expired.\n\n===Current venue===\nAfter suffering [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] in 1940, V\u00e9lez was sacked from the Villa Luro ground they were renting. Three years later, in 1941, the club obtained the terrain of the current stadium, property of the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]]. The ground was a swamp of the [[Maldonado Stream]], where construction was difficult. However, the club's president [[Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]] led the construction of the first stadium at the site, which was inaugurated on April 11, 1943. The new stadium used the same wood stands from the old Villa Luro stadium, and was inaugurated in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]. V\u00e9lez striker [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ferraro]] scored the first goal in the stadium's history (the others were scored by \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez for V\u00e9lez and [[Adolfo Pedernera]] twice for River). The current stadium was inaugurated on April 22, 1951.\n\nThe stadium was renamed in honor of Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani on December 7, 1968. The following year, a modern lighting system by [[Siemens]] was installed, and the first of the upper stand sections was completed.\n\n==Events hosted==\n=== Football ===\n====1978 FIFA World Cup====\n[[File:Cancha_de_Velez_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior view of the stadium in 2006]]\n[[File:Velez1.JPG|thumb|right|The stadium at night]]\nThe stadium was refurbished for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] with the completion of press boxes and another section of upper stands, and hosted three games in the group stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/joseamalfitani/|title=Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani|publisher=The Stadium Guide}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Round\n!Group\n!Team 1\n!Vs.\n!Team 2\n|-\n|June 3 ||1||3||{{fb|AUT}}||'''2\u20131'''||{{fb|ESP|1977}}\n|-\n|June 7 ||1||3||{{fb|AUT}}||'''1\u20130'''||{{fb|SWE}}\n|-\n|June 11 ||1||3||{{fb|ESP|1977}}||'''1\u20130'''||{{fb|SWE}}\n|}\n\n==== Argentina friendly matches ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!

The ground has  also hosted the [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina national team]] (''Los Pumas'') since 1986, when the side left to play at [[Estadio Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverry|Ferro Carril Oeste Stadium]] (their home venue by then) searching for higher capacity stadiums.\n\nWhen [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] played Argentina in November [[2005 South Africa rugby union tour of Argentina and Europe|2005]] at V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, they faced a strong ''Pumas'' side, which took a 20\u201316 lead into the half-time break, before fading in the second half and losing 34\u201323.\n\nIn the [[2006 mid-year rugby test series|2006 mid-year tests]], the second test against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], saw the ''Pumas'' win 45\u201327, Argentina's largest win ever over Wales. The national squad next hosted the world's top team, the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]. The New Zealanders survived an Argentine assault in the final minutes to hang on to win 25\u201319 and to deny Argentina a huge upset.\n\n''Los Pumas'' began their final preparation for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]] with a summer two-test series against visiting [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], including a 16\u20130 win at V\u00e9lez Sarsfield.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/6715723.stm |title=Argentina 16\u20130 Ireland |publisher=BBC |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070705040756/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/6715723.stm| archivedate= 5 July 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!

The stadium has a capacity of 49,540 spectators, although it does not provide seating for all of them like most Argentine stadia.\n\nThe Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium is also the [[national stadium]] for the [[Argentina national rugby union team]] (''Los Pumas''). Although the team plays test matches throughout the country, their highest-profile tests (such as against the New Zealand All Blacks) are usually held here.\nThe newly formed Argentine [[Super Rugby]] team, [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Jaguares]], are playing its home games at the stadium.\n\n==History==\n===First years===\n[[File:Velez1920.png|thumb|right|Grandstands (wooden made) view of the first stadium]]\nDuring its first years of existence, V\u00e9lez Sarsfield football team played its games in vacant lands of the neighborhood, with removable goal posts. In 1913 the [[Argentine Football Association]] ordered the club to host its home games at a bigger stadium so the club moved to the Juan Mart\u00edn Figallo's (a neighbor) countryhouse on Rod\u00f3 and Escalada streets. Figallo rented the club part of his land.\n\nIn 1914, the club called an assembly to discuss the posibility to rent lands on better places. The club got a land behind Villa Luro station, between Cortina and Bacacay streest. But the definitive stadium would be built in 1922, when the club rented a land to L\u00f3pez Bancalari Brothers on Guardia Nacional street. The club started to built a grandstand while the team continued playing in Villa Luro and other fields, until the construction finished. Works were ready in 1924, when the club inaugurated its first stadium with a grandstand, lockers, coffee shop, personnel room and secretary. The stadium was officially opened in a friendly match v [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]].\n\nNew grandstands were built between 1926 and 1927, completing the four sides of the stadium and therefore increasing its capacity. In 1935, the first match with artificial lighting was played at V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield venue. The local team defeated [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense|Platense]] 4\u20132. The end of an era came in 1940 when the club was intimated to leave the lands where the stadium was located due to the rental contract had expired.\n\n===Current venue===\nAfter suffering [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] in 1940, V\u00e9lez was sacked from the Villa Luro ground they were renting. Three years later, in 1941, the club obtained the terrain of the current stadium, property of the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]]. The ground was a swamp of the [[Maldonado Stream]], where construction was difficult. However, the club's president [[Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]] led the construction of the first stadium at the site, which was inaugurated on April 11, 1943. The new stadium used the same wood stands from the old Villa Luro stadium, and was inaugurated in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]. V\u00e9lez striker [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ferraro]] scored the first goal in the stadium's history (the others were scored by \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez for V\u00e9lez and [[Adolfo Pedernera]] twice for River). The current stadium was inaugurated on April 22, 1951.\n\nThe stadium was renamed in honor of Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani on December 7, 1968. The following year, a modern lighting system by [[Siemens]] was installed, and the first of the upper stand sections was completed.\n\n==Events hosted==\n=== Football ===\n====1978 FIFA World Cup====\n[[File:Cancha_de_Velez_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior view of the stadium in 2006]]\n[[File:Velez1.JPG|thumb|right|The stadium at night]]\nThe stadium was refurbished for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] with the completion of press boxes and another section of upper stands, and hosted three games in the group stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/joseamalfitani/|title=Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani|publisher=The Stadium Guide}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Round\n!Group\n!Team 1\n!Vs.\n!Team 2\n|-\n|June 3 ||1||3||{{fb|AUT}}||'''2\u20131'''||{{fb|ESP|1977}}\n|-\n|June 7 ||1||3||{{fb|AUT}}||'''1\u20130'''||{{fb|SWE}}\n|-\n|June 11 ||1||3||{{fb|ESP|1977}}||'''1\u20130'''||{{fb|SWE}}\n|}\n\n==== Argentina friendly matches ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!

The ground has  also hosted the [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina national team]] (''Los Pumas'') since 1986, when the side left to play at [[Estadio Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverry|Ferro Carril Oeste Stadium]] (their home venue by then) searching for higher capacity stadiums.\n\nWhen [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] played Argentina in November [[2005 South Africa rugby union tour of Argentina and Europe|2005]] at V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, they faced a strong ''Pumas'' side, which took a 20\u201316 lead into the half-time break, before fading in the second half and losing 34\u201323.\n\nIn the [[2006 mid-year rugby test series|2006 mid-year tests]], the second test against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], saw the ''Pumas'' win 45\u201327, Argentina's largest win ever over Wales. The national squad next hosted the world's top team, the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]. The New Zealanders survived an Argentine assault in the final minutes to hang on to win 25\u201319 and to deny Argentina a huge upset.\n\n''Los Pumas'' began their final preparation for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]] with a summer two-test series against visiting [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], including a 16\u20130 win at V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/6715723.stm |title=Argentina 16\u20130 Ireland |publisher=BBC |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070705040756/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/6715723.stm| archivedate= 5 July 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!

The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [[touchscreen]]-optimized interface based on available input devices{{nsmdns}}particularly on [[2-in-1 PC]]s, both interfaces include an updated [[Start menu]] which incorporates elements of [[Windows 7]]'s traditional Start menu with the tiles of [[Windows 8]]. Windows 10 also introduced the [[Microsoft Edge]] [[web browser]], a [[virtual desktop]] system, a window and desktop management feature called [[Task View]], support for [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint]] and [[face recognition]] login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [[DirectX 12]].\n\nWindows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [[Xbox Live]] integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [[Cortana]] personal assistant and the replacement of [[Internet Explorer]] with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [[Windows Update|update]] installation, [[digital privacy|privacy]] concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the [[adware]]-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3073457/how-microsofts-nasty-new-windows-10-pop-up-tricks-you-into-upgrading.html|title=How Microsoft's tricky new Windows 10 pop-up deceives you into upgrading|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=May 22, 2016|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Microsoft's goal to have Windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release failed<ref name=zdnet-onebillion/> (though it managed to reach the goal almost 5 years later),<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support |title = Microsoft hits its goal of 1 billion devices running Windows 10|date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> {{as of|2020|04|alt=by April 2020}} an estimated 70.98%<ref name =\"share\">{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 10 (and almost all of the rest of Windows users run unsupported versions), and thus 55% <!--54.72558% calculated from 70.98% x 77.1% \"Total percentage of Windows\" for desktop OS's multiplied by percentage of Windows 10 for Windows desktop OS.--> of all traditional PCs use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202003|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name =\"share\"/> Across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet and console), 35% <!--34.96%--> of devices run some kind of Windows, Windows 10 or older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-201807-202003|title=Operating System Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Development ==\nAt the [[Microsoft Inspire|Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference]] in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single [[software ecosystem]] for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. \"We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets{{nsmdns}}they'll all come together.\"<ref name=\"UniversalOS\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/07/microsoft-envisions-a-universal-os-but-it-might-not-be-called-windows/|title=Microsoft envisions a universal OS, but it might not be called Windows|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SingleEcosystem\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/14/microsoft-one-ecosystem-pcs-tablets-phones-tvs-windows-brand-over |title=Microsoft says it will have a 'single ecosystem' for PCs, tablets, phones, and TVs... and is 'Windows' dead? |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=July 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, technology writer [[Mary Jo Foley]] reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed \"Threshold\", after a planet in Microsoft's ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game franchise.<ref name=zdnet-threshold /> Similarly to \"Blue\" (which became Windows 8.1),<ref name=\"pcw-whatisblue\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027618/is-windows-blue-a-set-of-coordinated-updates-for-all-microsoft-products-.html | title=Is 'Windows Blue' a set of coordinated updates for all Microsoft products? | publisher=[[IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=February 8, 2013 | last=Chacos | first=Brad | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> Foley called Threshold a \"wave of operating systems\" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015.

By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex pins. However, a PIN is not a simpler [[password]]. While passwords are transmitted to [[domain controller]]s, PINs are not. They are tied to one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may be broken via [[rainbow table]]s, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to [[brute-force attack]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halfin |first1=Dani |last2=Syfuhs |first2=Steve |title=Why a PIN is better than a password |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password |website=Microsoft Docs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be confused with [[Microsoft account|the Passport platform of 1998]]).

The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5{{nbsp}}GB for [[32-bit]] systems and 2.6{{nbsp}}GB for [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]], which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance.

If Windows{{nbsp}}10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations. However, unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows{{nbsp}}10.

The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, although it was not in a feature-complete state at launch. While considering them a \"great idea in principle\", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that\n<blockquote>\nIt's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows{{nbsp}}10 from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required.<ref name=\"tr-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly positive, noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows{{nbsp}}10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows{{nbsp}}8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on [[voice detection]] was considered to be its \"true strength\", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as [[Google Now]]. Windows{{nbsp}}10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that \"Windows{{nbsp}}10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile.

Microsoft Edge was praised for being \"tremendously promising\", and \"a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was\", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows{{nbsp}}8 as being a \"reliable\" platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows{{nbsp}}10 was considered \"the best Windows yet\" and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be \"comfortable and effective\" across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch.<ref name=ars-review>{{cite web|title=Review: Windows 10 is the best version yet\u2014once the bugs get fixed|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that \"it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum.\"<ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /> Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after auto updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243581/windows-10-may-delete-your-programs-without-asking/|title=Windows 10 May Delete Your Programs Without Asking|date=Jan 4, 2018|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|access-date=Feb 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCritics have noted that Windows{{nbsp}}10 heavily emphasizes [[freemium]] services, and contains various advertising facilities.

In particular, it was pointed out that Microsoft's internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in 2014. Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program (which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug), as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders. In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version 1809, it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the [[Feedback Hub]] app for several months prior to the public release. Following the incident, Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report. When announcing the resumption of 1809's rollout, Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future, through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a \"dashboard\" that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates.<ref>{{Cite

Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code{{nsmdns}}including [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[smartphone]]s, [[embedded system]]s, [[Xbox One]], [[Surface Hub]] and [[Windows Mixed Reality|Mixed Reality]]. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [[touchscreen]]-optimized interface based on available input devices{{nsmdns}}particularly on [[2-in-1 PC]]s, both interfaces include an updated [[Start menu]] which incorporates elements of [[Windows 7]]'s traditional Start menu with the tiles of [[Windows 8]]. Windows 10 also introduced the [[Microsoft Edge]] [[web browser]], a [[virtual desktop]] system, a window and desktop management feature called [[Task View]], support for [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint]] and [[face recognition]] login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [[DirectX 12]].\n\nWindows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [[Xbox Live]] integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [[Cortana]] personal assistant and the replacement of [[Internet Explorer]] with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [[Windows Update|update]] installation, [[digital privacy|privacy]] concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the [[adware]]-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3073457/how-microsofts-nasty-new-windows-10-pop-up-tricks-you-into-upgrading.html|title=How Microsoft's tricky new Windows 10 pop-up deceives you into upgrading|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=May 22, 2016|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Microsoft's goal to have Windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release failed<ref name=zdnet-onebillion/> (though it managed to reach the goal almost 5 years later),<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support |title = Microsoft hits its goal of 1 billion devices running Windows 10|date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> {{as of|2020|04|alt=by April 2020}} an estimated 70.98% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 10 (and almost all of the rest of Windows users run unsupported versions),<ref name =\"share\">{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> and thus 55% <!--54.72558% calculated from 70.98% x 77.1% \"Total percentage of Windows\" for desktop OS's multiplied by percentage of Windows 10 for Windows desktop OS.--> of all traditional PCs use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202003|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name =\"share\"/> Across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet and console), 35% <!--34.96%--> of devices run some kind of Windows, Windows 10 or older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-201807-202003|title=Operating System Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Development ==\nAt the [[Microsoft Inspire|Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference]] in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single [[software ecosystem]] for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. \"We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets{{nsmdns}}they'll all come together.\"<ref name=\"UniversalOS\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/07/microsoft-envisions-a-universal-os-but-it-might-not-be-called-windows/|title=Microsoft envisions a universal OS, but it might not be called Windows|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SingleEcosystem\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/14/microsoft-one-ecosystem-pcs-tablets-phones-tvs-windows-brand-over |title=Microsoft says it will have a 'single ecosystem' for PCs, tablets, phones, and TVs... and is 'Windows' dead? |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=July 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, technology writer [[Mary Jo Foley]] reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed \"Threshold\", after a planet in Microsoft's ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game franchise.<ref name=zdnet-threshold /> Similarly to \"Blue\" (which became Windows 8.1),<ref name=\"pcw-whatisblue\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027618/is-windows-blue-a-set-of-coordinated-updates-for-all-microsoft-products-.html | title=Is 'Windows Blue' a set of coordinated updates for all Microsoft products? | publisher=[[IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=February 8, 2013 | last=Chacos | first=Brad | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> Foley called Threshold a \"wave of operating systems\" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015.

By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex pins. However, a PIN is not a simpler [[password]]. While passwords are transmitted to [[domain controller]]s, PINs are not. They are tied to one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may be broken via [[rainbow table]]s, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to [[brute-force attack]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halfin |first1=Dani |last2=Syfuhs |first2=Steve |title=Why a PIN is better than a password |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password |website=Microsoft Docs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be confused with [[Microsoft account|the Passport platform of 1998]]).

The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5{{nbsp}}GB for [[32-bit]] systems and 2.6{{nbsp}}GB for [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]], which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance.

If Windows{{nbsp}}10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations. However, unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows{{nbsp}}10.

The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, although it was not in a feature-complete state at launch. While considering them a \"great idea in principle\", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that\n<blockquote>\nIt's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows{{nbsp}}10 from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required.<ref name=\"tr-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly positive, noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows{{nbsp}}10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows{{nbsp}}8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on [[voice detection]] was considered to be its \"true strength\", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as [[Google Now]]. Windows{{nbsp}}10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that \"Windows{{nbsp}}10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile.

Microsoft Edge was praised for being \"tremendously promising\", and \"a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was\", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows{{nbsp}}8 as being a \"reliable\" platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows{{nbsp}}10 was considered \"the best Windows yet\" and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be \"comfortable and effective\" across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch.<ref name=ars-review>{{cite web|title=Review: Windows 10 is the best version yet\u2014once the bugs get fixed|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that \"it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum.\"<ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /> Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after auto updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243581/windows-10-may-delete-your-programs-without-asking/|title=Windows 10 May Delete Your Programs Without Asking|date=Jan 4, 2018|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|access-date=Feb 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCritics have noted that Windows{{nbsp}}10 heavily emphasizes [[freemium]] services, and contains various advertising facilities.

In particular, it was pointed out that Microsoft's internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in 2014. Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program (which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug), as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders. In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version 1809, it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the [[Feedback Hub]] app for several months prior to the public release. Following the incident, Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report. When announcing the resumption of 1809's rollout, Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future, through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a \"dashboard\" that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates.<ref>{{Cite
