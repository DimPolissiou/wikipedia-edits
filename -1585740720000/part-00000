Scott Russell & Co. at [[Millwall Iron Works]] on the [[River Thames]], London.  She was by far the largest ship ever built at the time of her 1858 launch, and had the capacity to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia without refuelling.  Her length of {{convert|692|ft}} was only surpassed in 1899 by the {{convert|705|ft|m|adj=on}} 17,274-gross-ton [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']], her [[gross tonnage]] of 18,915 was only surpassed in 1901 by the {{convert|701|ft|m|adj=on}} 21,035-gross-ton [[RMS Celtic|RMS ''Celtic'']], and her 4,000-passenger capacity was surpassed in 1913 by the 4,935-passenger [[SS Imperator|SS ''Imperator'']]. The ship's five [[Funnel (ship)|funnels]] were rare and were later reduced to four. It also had the largest set of [[paddle wheels]].\n\nBrunel knew her affectionately as the \"Great Babe\".  He died in 1859 shortly after her maiden voyage, during which she was damaged by an explosion.  After repairs, she plied for several years as a passenger liner between Britain and North America before being converted to a cable-laying ship and laying the first lasting [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in 1866.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Arthur |year=1994 |title=The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization |location= |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |isbn=978-1-85573-301-5 |page=203 }}</ref> Finishing her life as a floating [[music hall]] and advertising hoarding (for the department store [[Lewis's]]) in [[Liverpool]], she was broken up on Merseyside in 1889.\n\n==History==\n\n===Concept===\n[[File:IKBrunelChains.jpg|thumb|upright|The famous [[Robert Howlett]] photo of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] against the launching chains of ''Great Eastern'' at Millwall in 1857.]]\n\nAfter his success in pioneering steam travel to North America with [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']] and [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], Brunel turned his attention to longer voyages as far as Australia and realised the potential of a ship that could travel round the world without the need of refuelling.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=309}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 1852, Brunel made a sketch of a steamship in his diary and wrote beneath it: \"Say 600 ft x 65 ft x 30 ft\" (180 m x 20 m x 9.1 m). These measurements were six times larger by volume than any ship afloat; such a large vessel would benefit from [[economies of scale]] and would be both fast and economical, requiring fewer crew than the equivalent tonnage made up of smaller ships. Brunel realised that the ship would need more than one propulsion system; since twin [[Propeller|screws]] were still very much experimental, he settled on a combination of a single screw and [[paddle wheels]], with auxiliary sail power. Although Brunel had pioneered the screw propeller on a large scale with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], he did not believe that it was possible to build a single propeller and shaft (or, for that matter, a paddleshaft) that could transmit the required horsepower to drive his giant ship at the required speed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=313}}</ref>\n\nBrunel showed his idea to [[John Scott Russell]], an experienced naval architect and ship builder whom he had first met at [[the Great Exhibition]]. Scott Russell examined Brunel's plan and made his own calculations as to the ship's feasibility. He calculated that it would have a displacement of 20,000 tons and would require {{convert|8500|hp}} to achieve {{convert|14|kn|km/h}}, but believed it was possible. At Scott Russell's suggestion, they approached the directors of the [[Eastern Steam Navigation Company]].\n\n===Eastern Steam Navigation Company===\nThe Eastern Company was formed in January 1851 with the plan of exploiting the increase in trade and emigration to India, China and Australia. To make this plan viable they needed a subsidy in the form of a mail contract from the British General Post Office, which they [[Request for tender|tendered]] for and Brunel started the construction of two vessels, ''Victoria'' and ''Adelaide''. However, in March 1852 the Government awarded the contracts to the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]], even though the Eastern Company's tender was lower. This left them in the position of having a company without a purpose.\n\nBrunel's large ship promised to be able to compete with the fast clippers that currently dominated the route, as she would be able to carry sufficient coal for a non-stop passage and the company invited him to present his ideas to the board. He was unable to attend due to illness and Scott Russell took his place.\n\nThe Company then set up a committee to investigate the proposal, and they reported in favour and the scheme was adopted at a board meeting held in July 1852. Brunel was appointed Engineer to the project and he began to gather tenders to build the hull, paddle engines and screw engines. Brunel had a considerable stake in the company and when requested to appoint a resident engineer refused in no uncertain terms:\n{{quote|I cannot act under any supervision, or form part of any system which recognises any other advisor than myself&nbsp;... if any doubt ever arises on these points I must cease to be responsible and cease to act.}}\n\nHe was just as firm in the terms for the final contract where he insisted that nothing was to be undertaken without his express consent, and that procedures and requirements for the construction were specifically laid down.\n\n===1854\u20131859: Construction to maiden voyage===\n\n====Construction====\n[[File:SS Great Eastern diagram.jpg|thumb|Sectional plan of ''Great Eastern'']]\n[[File:The Great Eastern under construction at Millwall (4313594000).jpg|thumb|left|Construction of ''Great Eastern'', August 18, 1855]]\nAlthough Brunel had estimated the cost of building the ship at \u00a3500,000, Scott Russell offered a very low tender of \u00a3377,200: \u00a3275,200 for the hull, \u00a360,000 for the screw engines and boilers, and \u00a342,000 for the paddle engines and boilers. Scott Russell even offered to reduce the tender to \u00a3258,000 if an order for a sister ship was placed at the same time. Brunel accepted Scott Russell's tender in May 1853, without questioning it; Scott Russell was a highly skilled shipbuilder and Brunel would accept an estimate from such an esteemed colleague without question.<ref>Gillings, p. 128</ref>\n\nIn early 1854 work could at last begin. The first problem to arise was where the ship was to be built. Scott Russell's contract stipulated that it was to be built in a dock, but Russell quoted a price of \u00a38\u201310,000 to build the necessary dock and so this part of the scheme was abandoned, partly due to the cost and also to the difficulty of finding a suitable site for the dock. The idea of a normal stern first launch was also rejected because of the great length of the vessel, also because to provide the right launch angle the bow of the ship would have to be raised {{convert|40|ft|m}} in the air. Eventually it was decided to build the ship sideways to the river and use a mechanical slip designed by Brunel for the launch. Later the mechanical design was dropped on the grounds of cost, although the sideways plan remained.\n\nHaving decided on a sideways launch, a suitable site had to be found, as Scott Russell's Millwall, London, yard was too small. The adjacent yard belonging to [[David Napier (marine engineer)|David Napier]] was empty, available and suitable, so it was leased and a railway line constructed between the two yards for moving materials. The site of the launch is still visible on the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Part of the slipway has been preserved on the waterfront, while at low tide, more of the slipway can be seen on the Thames foreshore. The remains of the slipways, and other structures associated with the launch of the SS ''Great Eastern'', have recently been surveyed by the [[Thames Discovery Programme]], a community project recording the archaeology of the Thames intertidal zone in London.\n\n''Great Eastern'''s keel was laid down on 1 May 1854. The hull was an all-iron construction, a double hull of {{convert|19|mm|in|abbr=on}} wrought iron in {{convert|0.86|m|ftin|abbr=off}} plates with ribs every {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Internally, the hull was divided by two {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, longitudinal bulkheads and further transverse bulkheads dividing the ship into nineteen compartments. ''Great Eastern'' was the first ship to incorporate the [[double hull|double-skinned hull]], a feature which would not be seen again in a ship for several decades, but which is now compulsory for reasons of safety.\n\nShe had sail, paddle and screw propulsion. The paddle-wheels were {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and the four-bladed screw-propeller was {{convert|7.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The power came from four steam engines for the paddles and an additional engine for the [[propeller]]. Total power was estimated at 6 MW (8,000 [[horsepower|hp]]). The specific requirements of the Eastern Company also vindicated Brunel's initial concept of using both paddlewheels and a screw. The ''Great Britain'' had a [[chain drive]] 'overdrive' gear so that the slow-turning marine steam engines of the day could drive a screw propeller of a suitably small diameter while making the required thrust. This had proven troublesome and in his new ship Brunel resolved to use direct drive, requiring the much larger propeller.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=313}}</ref> To be effective this had to be fully submerged at all times, fixing the ship's minimum practical draught while using screw propulsion at around {{convert|7.62|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Brunel designed the ''Great Eastern'' to have a maximum draught of {{convert|9.144|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Company required that the ship be able to dock at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where navigation was restricted by the shallow [[Hooghly River]] which required a draught of no more than {{convert|7.0|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Brunel calculated that the ship would be able to carry enough coal to steam from Calcutta to a British port while not exceeding that draught, while if the ship took on coal for the final leg of her homeward voyage at [[Trincomalee]] instead she would be able to transit the Hooghly with a full load of passengers and cargo while drawing {{convert|6.09|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This would leave around half of the top-most blade of the screw clear of the water, greatly reducing the thrust it developed and the efficiency of the engines. Thus when operating at lighter loads and shallow draughts, the ''Great Eastern'' would require paddlewheels. After consultation with [[Joshua Field (engineer)|Joshua Field]], Brunel set the power of the two sets of engines so that the ''Great Eastern's'' paddlewheels provided about a third of the total mechanical propulsion, with the screw propeller providing the majority.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=314}}</ref>\n\nShe also had six masts (said to be named after the days of a week \u2013 Monday being the fore mast and Saturday the [[Spanker (sail)|spanker mast]]), providing space for {{convert|1686|m2|sqft}} of sails (7 gaff and max. 9 (usually 4) square sails), rigged similar to a topsail schooner with a main gaff sail ([[fore-and-aft]] sail) on each mast, one \"jib\" on the fore mast and three square sails on masts no. 2 and no. 3 (Tuesday & Wednesday); for a time mast no. 4 was also fitted with three yards. In later years, some of the yards were removed. Her maximum speed was 24&nbsp;km/h (13 [[knot (unit)|knots]]).\n\n===Scott Russell bankruptcy===\n\nAt the beginning of February 1856, Brunel advised the Eastern Company that they should take possession of the ship to avoid it being seized by Scott Russell's creditors. This caused Scott Russell's bankers to refuse to honour his cheques and foreclose on his assets and on 4 February Scott Russell suspended all payments to his creditors and dismissed all his workmen a week later.\n\nRussell's creditors met on 12 February and it was revealed that Russell had liabilities of \u00a3122,940 and assets of \u00a3100,353. It was decided that his existing contracts would be allowed to be completed and the business would be liquidated. He issued a statement to the Board of the Eastern Company in which he repudiated his contract and effectively handed the uncompleted ship back to them. When the situation was reviewed it was found that three-quarters of the work on the hull had not been completed and that there was a deficit of 1,200 tons between the amount of iron supplied and that used on the ship.\n\nBrunel, meanwhile, wrote to John Yates and instructed him to negotiate with Scott Russell for the lease of his yard and equipment. Yates replied that Scott Russell had mortgaged the yard to his banker and that any negotiation would have to be with the bank, who after weeks of wrangling agreed to lease the yard and equipment until 12 August 1857.\n\nThe Eastern Company began the task of completing the ship. Work recommenced in May and took longer than expected to complete. Brunel reported in June 1857 that once the screw, screw shaft and sternpost had been installed the ship would be ready for launching. However, the launch ways and cradles would not be ready in time since the contract for their construction had only been placed in January 1857. Under pressure from all sides, the lease of the shipyard costing \u00a31,000 a month, and against his better judgement, Brunel agreed to launch the ship on 3 November 1857 to catch the high tide.\n\n===Launch===\n\n[[File:Great eastern launch attempt.jpg|thumb|left|''Great Eastern'' before launch in 1858]]\n[[File:Great Eastern painting smooth sea-2.jpg|right|thumb|Hand-coloured lithograph of the SS ''Great Eastern'', the great ship of IK Brunel as imagined by the artist at her launch in 1858]]\n\nBrunel had hoped to conduct the launch with a minimum of publicity but many thousands of spectators had heard of it and occupied vantage points all round the yard. He was also dismayed to discover that the Eastern Company's directors had sold 3,000 tickets for spectators to enter the shipyard.\n\nAs he was preparing for the launch, some of the directors joined him on the rostrum with a list of names for the ship. On being asked which he preferred, Brunel replied \"Call her Tom Thumb if you like\". At 12:30 pm Henrietta (daughter of a major fundraiser for the ship, [[Henry Thomas Hope]]) christened the ship ''Leviathan'' much to everyone's surprise since she was commonly known as ''Great Eastern''; her name subsequently changed back to ''Great Eastern'' in July 1858.\n\nThe launch, was however,<ref name=\"Mechanics Monthly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ikbrunel.org.uk/Mechanics-Monthly|title=Mechanics Monthly - Isambard Kingdom Brunel|work=ikbrunel.org.uk}}</ref> unsuccessful as the steam winches and manual capstans used to haul the ship towards the water were not up to the job. Brunel made another attempt on the 19th and again on the 28th, this time using [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic ram]]s to move the ship, but these too proved inadequate. The ship was successfully launched sideways at 1:42pm on 31 January 1858, aided by an unusually high tide and strong winds and using more powerful hydraulic rams supplied by the then-new [[Richard Tangye|Tangye]] company of Birmingham, the association with such a famous project giving a useful fillip to the fledgling company.<ref name=\"brunel2c\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_eastern.htm|title=Brunel 200: SS Great Eastern|work=brunel200.com}}</ref>\n\nShe was {{convert|211|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, with a [[draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} unloaded and {{convert|9.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} fully laden, and displaced 32,000 tons fully loaded. In comparison, SS ''Persia'', launched in 1856, was {{convert|119|m|ft|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}} beam.\n\nThe site of launch is still partly visible these days next to Burrell's Wharf on the Isle of Dogs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Great Eastern Launch Site|url = http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Great_Eastern_Launch_Site.htm|website = www.infobritain.co.uk|access-date = 2015-10-14|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150920095231/http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Great_Eastern_Launch_Site.htm|archive-date = 20 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Suez Canal concerns===\n\nIn 1857, during the planning of the [[Suez Canal]], it was thought that ''Great Eastern'' would not be able to traverse it, since she had a draught of {{convert|28|ft|abbr=on}} and it was expected that the canal would be excavated to a depth of {{convert|26|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book| last = de Lesseps | first = Ferdinand | authorlink = Ferdinand de Lesseps | title = Inquiry into the opinions of the commercial classes of Great Britain on the Suez ship canal | publisher = John Wheal | year = 1857 | location = London | pages = [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintoopin01lessgoog/page/n76 63] | url = https://archive.org/details/inquiryintoopin01lessgoog}}</ref> In any event, when the canal was opened to shipping in 1869, ''Great Eastern'' was no longer in passenger service.\n\n===Fitting out===\n\nThe launch of the ship cost \u00a3170,000, a third of Brunel's estimate for the entire vessel, and it had yet to be fitted out. It was difficult to get any more money from the Eastern Company's investors as the company was close to bankruptcy. To prevent this from happening, a new company was formed, the \"Great Ship Company\", with capital of \u00a3340,000. They bought the ship for \u00a3160,000, which left enough funds for fitting her out. The Eastern Company's shareholders were given the market value of their \u00a320 shares (\u00a32 10s) towards payment for shares in the new company and the Eastern Steam Navigation Company entered liquidation.\n\nTenders were invited for fitting the ship out, and two were received \u2013 one from Wigram and Lucas for \u00a3142,000, and the other from John Scott Russell for \u00a3125,000. Brunel had taken a long holiday on medical advice and was absent when the contract was awarded to Scott Russell. The work was begun in January 1859, and was completed by August.\n\n===Maiden voyage===\n\n30 August 1859 was given as the date of the first voyage, but this was later put back to 6 September. The destination was [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], from which a trial trip into the Atlantic would be made. Following this the ship would sail to [[Holyhead]], Wales. The company had made an agreement with the Canada's [[Grand Trunk Railway]] to use [[Portland, Maine]] as its US destination, and the railway company had built a special jetty to accommodate the ship. [[William Harrison (merchant navy officer)|William Harrison]] was appointed Captain in 1856;{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} he drowned on 21 January 1860 while sailing from [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] to Southampton in the ship's boat.<ref name=S210160>{{Cite news |title=Fatal boat accident in the Southampton Docks |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=21 January 1860 |issue=11058 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Explosion on board the Great Eastern Steam Ship, off Hastings, on the 9th September, 1859 RMG PY0309.tiff|thumb|The Explosion on board the ''Great Eastern'' Steam Ship, off Hastings, on 9 September 1859]]\nOn 9 September the ship had passed down the Thames, and out into the English Channel, and had just passed [[Hastings]] when there was a huge explosion, the forward deck blowing apart with enough force to throw the No. 1 funnel into the air, followed by a rush of escaping steam. Scott Russell and two engineers went below and ordered the steam to be blown off and the engine speed reduced. Five stokers died from being scalded by hot steam, while four or five others were badly injured and one had leapt overboard and had been lost. The accident was discovered to have been caused by a feedwater heater's steam exhaust having been closed, and the explosion's power had been concentrated by the ship's strong bulkheads.<ref>{{cite book | last = Burke | first = Edmund | authorlink = Edmund Burke | title = The Annual Register | publisher = J. & F.H.

Instead, she was used in the transatlantic business, where she could not compete in speed and performance with similar vessels already in service.\"<ref>\n{{cite journal|first=R.

Among the passengers were the two journalists and engineers [[Zerah Colburn (locomotive designer)|Zerah Colburn]] and [[Alexander Lyman Holley]] as well as three directors of the Great Ship Company.\n\nPreparations were initially made for the ship to sail on 16 June 1860 and the passengers boarded her on the 14th. After visitors had been sent ashore the Captain (Capt. John Vine Hall) announced that he would not be sailing until the 17th, as the crew were drunk. Director [[Daniel Gooch]], who was travelling aboard her, was not pleased. He was further displeased by the route taken by the ship which was the more southerly of the regular steamer routes as he had wanted the ship to complete the journey in nine days. In the event, the voyage took 10 days 19 hours.\n\n====1861 government charter====\nUpon ''Great Eastern's'' return to England, the ship was chartered by the British Government to transport troops to [[Quebec]]. 2,144 officers and men, 473 women and children, and 200 horses were embarked at Liverpool along with 40 paying passengers. The ship sailed on 25 June 1861 and went at full speed throughout most of the trip arriving at her destination 8 days and 6 hours after leaving Liverpool. ''Great Eastern'' stayed for a month and returned to Britain at the beginning of July with 357 paying passengers.<ref>Emmerson, p. 99</ref>\n\nAlthough the ship had made around \u00a314,000 on its first Atlantic voyage, the Great Ship Company's finances were in a poor state, with their shares dropping in price. They were also threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] for not making Portland, Maine the ship's port of call as agreed.<ref>Dugan, p. 52</ref> In addition, [[John Scott Russell|Scott Russell]] had been awarded the sum of \u00a318,000 for repairs following the 1859 explosion. The Company managed to appeal against this but Scott Russell applied to the courts and the Chief Justice found in his favour. The company appealed again, and due to rumours that the ship was about to leave the country, Russell's solicitors took possession of her. The Great Ship Company lost its appeal and had to pay the sum awarded; to cover this and the expenses of a second US voyage, they raised \u00a335,000 using [[debenture]]s.<ref>Tyler, p. 323</ref>\n\n====Second voyage to North America====\n\nOnly 100 passengers booked for the second voyage, which was originally scheduled to depart [[Milford Haven]] on 1 May 1861. However, the boat taking the passengers to the ship ran aground and they and their luggage had to be rescued by small boats.\n\nThe voyage took 9 days 13 hours. ''Great Eastern'''s arrival in New York was virtually unnoticed due to the [[American Civil War]], and when it was opened to the public at 25 cents a head there was little interest. 194 passengers sailed on the return journey on 25 May and 5,000 tons of wheat was also carried.\n\n====Third voyage to North America====\n''Great Eastern'' sailed from Liverpool on Tuesday 10 September 1861, commanded by Captain James Walker. On her second day out the wind increased to [[gale]] force, causing the ship to roll heavily. The port paddle wheel was completely lost, and the starboard paddle wheel smashed to pieces when one of the lifeboats broke loose. At the same time it was discovered that the [[cast iron]] rudder post, which was {{convert|11|in|mm}} in diameter, had sheared off {{convert|2|ft|abbr=on}} above its collar and the rudder was swinging free and hitting the screw, which was slowly breaking it up.\n\nCaptain Walker ordered his officers to say nothing to the passengers concerning the situation, then had a [[trysail]] hoisted which was immediately ripped apart by the wind. He then had a four-ton [[spar (sailing)|spar]] thrown overboard secured with a [[hawser]] to try to bring some control to the ship, but it only worked for a short while before being torn away.\n\nBy the end of the second day some of the passengers had an idea as to the predicament they were in and formed a committee chaired by Liverpool shipping merchant George Oakwood. The captain agreed to meet Oakwood and allowed him to inspect the ship. What he found was far worse than had been expected: none of the cargo had been stowed properly and it was all rolling loose in the holds. Hamilton E. Towle, an American [[civil engineer]], who was returning to the States after completing his contract working as a supervising engineer on the [[Danube River]] dry-docks in Austria, visited the rudder room and after inspecting the damage came up with a plan to regain control of the rudder.\n\nTowle's scheme was taken to the captain, who failed to act on it. In the evening of the third day, ''Magnet'', a brig from [[Nova Scotia]], appeared on the scene. Captain Walker asked her captain if he would stand by. He agreed, but it turned out there was little he could do, and after several hours the brig left, later succeeding in a claim for [[demurrage]] from the Great Ship Company for the delay.\n\nTowle now presented his plan to the passengers' committee, and in turn they pressured the captain into letting him try it. Towle had a {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} chain composed of {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} links wound around the rudder post below the break, then secured the ends of the chain to the port and starboard frames of the ship using [[block and tackle]]. Two lighter chains were led down from the [[pilothouse|wheelhouse]] and attached to the heavy chain and also to the ship's frames. This allowed some limited movement of the rudder, and the ship became steerable again.<ref>{{cite book| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York | publisher = C. van Benthuysen | year = 1862 | location = | pages = [https://archive.org/details/annualreportame09unkngoog/page/n429 421]\u2013422 | url = https://archive.org/details/annualreportame09unkngoog | doi = | id = | isbn =}}</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Sunday 15 September the storm finally abated. Towle and the passengers committee insisted that the Captain try the repaired rudder and eventually the engines were started and at 5 pm that day after 75 hours of drifting out of control the ship answered the helm and was turned on to a course towards Ireland, {{convert|300|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn arrival at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] the harbourmaster refused to let the ship enter because she was not under full control and injured passengers were taken off by boats. The ship had to stand off for three days until she was towed in by [[HMS Advice (1837)|HMS ''Advice'']]. Arrangements for temporary repairs were begun and the passengers were offered free transport to the US aboard other ships. Once the repairs were completed the ship sailed to [[Milford Haven]] where permanent repairs were to be carried out. Smaller, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} paddlewheels were fitted, and improvements were made to the steering.\n\nUpon arriving in the US, Towle filed a claim for $100,000 under the laws of salvage, claiming that his efforts had saved the ship. The case was taken to court, and he was awarded the sum of $15,000, quite a considerable sum for that period. ''[[Scientific American]]'' published an account of the incident and a description of Towle's device.<ref>\"The way the Great Eastern was saved,\" ''Scientific American'', vol. 5, no. 17, pages 263\u2013264 (26 October 1861).

The ship was opened to visitors and around 3,000 a day took the opportunity. The return journey to Liverpool was profitable, with 389 passengers travelling along with 3,000 tons of freight. The west-to-east trip took 9 days 12 hours, a reduction of 12 hours on her previous record.\n\nThe second voyage of 1862 saw the ship arriving in New York on 11 July with 376 passengers including the President of [[Liberia]], [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts|J. J. Roberts]]. The return journey later that month carried 500 passengers and 8,000 tons of cargo, the ship arriving at Liverpool on 7 August.\n\n====Great Eastern Rock incident====\n''Great Eastern'' left Liverpool on 17 August with 1,530 passengers on board and a substantial amount of freight which increased her draught to {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nNot wishing to enter [[New York Bay]] over [[Sandy Hook]] bar due to the ship's deep draught, the captain decided to steam up [[Long Island Sound]] and moor at [[Flushing Bay, New York|Flushing Bay]]. The [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] came on board at 1:30 am and the ship moved slowly ahead. At about 2:00 am {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} east of [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]], [[Long Island]] a rumble was heard and the ship heeled slightly. The pilot said she had probably rubbed against the \"North East Ripps\" (later renamed \"Great Eastern Rock\"). The captain sent an officer down to check for damage and he reported no leaks. The ship had a list to [[Port (nautical)|port]], but made her way into New York the next day under her own steam.\n\nIt was discovered that the rock had opened a gash in the ship's outer hull over {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|83|ft|m}} long. The enormous size of ''Great Eastern'' precluded the use of any drydock repair facility in the US, and the brothers Henry and [[Edward S. Renwick]] devised a daring plan to build a watertight, {{convert|104|by|15|ft|m}} [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D.

The brothers claimed that it would take two weeks to complete the repairs and said that they would only take payment if successful. The demands of the [[American Civil War]] caused delays in getting the iron plates required, and instead of two weeks the repairs took three months at a cost to the company of \u00a370,000.

One of her paddle wheels was damaged on the last outward trip and she completed it using her screw, while on the return journey she ran down and damaged ''Jane'', a small sailing ship. The company lost nearly \u00a320,000 on the voyages due to a price war between the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and [[Inman Line|Inman]] shipping lines, and ended up with debts of more than \u00a3142,000, which forced them to lay up ''Great Eastern''.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}\n\n===Sale===\n[[File:Great Eastern Milford Haven 2.JPG|thumb|''Great Eastern'' harboured in [[Milford Haven]], 1870s]]\n\nA plan was mooted to offer the ship in a lottery, which came to nothing, and the ship was finally offered for sale on 14 January 1864 at the [[Liverpool Exchange]], the bidding opening at \u00a350,000.

Scott Russell & Co. at [[Millwall Iron Works]] on the [[River Thames]], London.  She was by far the largest ship ever built at the time of her 1858 launch, and had the capacity to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia without refuelling.  Her length of {{convert|692|ft}} was only surpassed in 1899 by the {{convert|705|ft|m|adj=on}} 17,274-gross-ton [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|RMS ''Oceanic'']], her [[gross tonnage]] of 18,915 was only surpassed in 1901 by the {{convert|701|ft|m|adj=on}} 21,035-gross-ton [[RMS Celtic|RMS ''Celtic'']], and her 4,000-passenger capacity was surpassed in 1913 by the 4,935-passenger [[SS Imperator|SS ''Imperator'']]. The ship's five [[Funnel (ship)|funnels]] were rare and were later reduced to four. It also had the largest set of [[paddle wheels]].\n\nBrunel knew her affectionately as the \"Great Babe\".  He died in 1859 shortly after her maiden voyage, during which she was damaged by an explosion.  After repairs, she plied for several years as a passenger liner between Britain and North America before being converted to a cable-laying ship and laying the first lasting [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in 1866.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Arthur |year=1994 |title=The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization |location= |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |isbn=978-1-85573-301-5 |page=203 }}</ref> Finishing her life as a floating [[music hall]] and advertising hoarding (for the department store [[Lewis's]]) in [[Liverpool]], she was broken up on Merseyside in 1889.\n\n==History==\n\n===Concept===\n[[File:IKBrunelChains.jpg|thumb|upright|The famous [[Robert Howlett]] photo of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] against the launching chains of ''Great Eastern'' at Millwall in 1857.]]\n\nAfter his success in pioneering steam travel to North America with [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']] and [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], Brunel turned his attention to longer voyages as far as Australia and realised the potential of a ship that could travel round the world without the need of refuelling.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=309}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 1852, Brunel made a sketch of a steamship in his diary and wrote beneath it: \"Say 600 ft x 65 ft x 30 ft\" (180 m x 20 m x 9.1 m). These measurements were six times larger by volume than any ship afloat; such a large vessel would benefit from [[economies of scale]] and would be both fast and economical, requiring fewer crew than the equivalent tonnage made up of smaller ships. Brunel realised that the ship would need more than one propulsion system; since twin [[Propeller|screws]] were still very much experimental, he settled on a combination of a single screw and [[paddle wheels]], with auxiliary sail power. Although Brunel had pioneered the screw propeller on a large scale with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], he did not believe that it was possible to build a single propeller and shaft (or, for that matter, a paddleshaft) that could transmit the required horsepower to drive his giant ship at the required speed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=313}}</ref> \n\nBrunel showed his idea to [[John Scott Russell]], an experienced naval architect and ship builder whom he had first met at [[the Great Exhibition]]. Scott Russell examined Brunel's plan and made his own calculations as to the ship's feasibility. He calculated that it would have a displacement of 20,000 tons and would require {{convert|8500|hp}} to achieve {{convert|14|kn|km/h}}, but believed it was possible. At Scott Russell's suggestion, they approached the directors of the [[Eastern Steam Navigation Company]].\n\n===Eastern Steam Navigation Company===\nThe Eastern Company was formed in January 1851 with the plan of exploiting the increase in trade and emigration to India, China and Australia. To make this plan viable they needed a subsidy in the form of a mail contract from the British General Post Office, which they [[Request for tender|tendered]] for and Brunel started the construction of two vessels, ''Victoria'' and ''Adelaide''. However, in March 1852 the Government awarded the contracts to the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]], even though the Eastern Company's tender was lower. This left them in the position of having a company without a purpose.\n\nBrunel's large ship promised to be able to compete with the fast clippers that currently dominated the route, as she would be able to carry sufficient coal for a non-stop passage and the company invited him to present his ideas to the board. He was unable to attend due to illness and Scott Russell took his place.\n\nThe Company then set up a committee to investigate the proposal, and they reported in favour and the scheme was adopted at a board meeting held in July 1852. Brunel was appointed Engineer to the project and he began to gather tenders to build the hull, paddle engines and screw engines. Brunel had a considerable stake in the company and when requested to appoint a resident engineer refused in no uncertain terms:\n{{quote|I cannot act under any supervision, or form part of any system which recognises any other advisor than myself&nbsp;... if any doubt ever arises on these points I must cease to be responsible and cease to act.}}\n\nHe was just as firm in the terms for the final contract where he insisted that nothing was to be undertaken without his express consent, and that procedures and requirements for the construction were specifically laid down.\n\n===1854\u20131859: Construction to maiden voyage===\n\n====Construction====\n[[File:SS Great Eastern diagram.jpg|thumb|Sectional plan of ''Great Eastern'']]\n[[File:The Great Eastern under construction at Millwall (4313594000).jpg|thumb|left|Construction of ''Great Eastern'', August 18, 1855]]\nAlthough Brunel had estimated the cost of building the ship at \u00a3500,000, Scott Russell offered a very low tender of \u00a3377,200: \u00a3275,200 for the hull, \u00a360,000 for the screw engines and boilers, and \u00a342,000 for the paddle engines and boilers. Scott Russell even offered to reduce the tender to \u00a3258,000 if an order for a sister ship was placed at the same time. Brunel accepted Scott Russell's tender in May 1853, without questioning it; Scott Russell was a highly skilled shipbuilder and Brunel would accept an estimate from such an esteemed colleague without question.<ref>Gillings, p. 128</ref>\n\nIn early 1854 work could at last begin. The first problem to arise was where the ship was to be built. Scott Russell's contract stipulated that it was to be built in a dock, but Russell quoted a price of \u00a38\u201310,000 to build the necessary dock and so this part of the scheme was abandoned, partly due to the cost and also to the difficulty of finding a suitable site for the dock. The idea of a normal stern first launch was also rejected because of the great length of the vessel, also because to provide the right launch angle the bow of the ship would have to be raised {{convert|40|ft|m}} in the air. Eventually it was decided to build the ship sideways to the river and use a mechanical slip designed by Brunel for the launch. Later the mechanical design was dropped on the grounds of cost, although the sideways plan remained.\n\nHaving decided on a sideways launch, a suitable site had to be found, as Scott Russell's Millwall, London, yard was too small. The adjacent yard belonging to [[David Napier (marine engineer)|David Napier]] was empty, available and suitable, so it was leased and a railway line constructed between the two yards for moving materials. The site of the launch is still visible on the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Part of the slipway has been preserved on the waterfront, while at low tide, more of the slipway can be seen on the Thames foreshore. The remains of the slipways, and other structures associated with the launch of the SS ''Great Eastern'', have recently been surveyed by the [[Thames Discovery Programme]], a community project recording the archaeology of the Thames intertidal zone in London.\n\n''Great Eastern'''s keel was laid down on 1 May 1854. The hull was an all-iron construction, a double hull of {{convert|19|mm|in|abbr=on}} wrought iron in {{convert|0.86|m|ftin|abbr=off}} plates with ribs every {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Internally, the hull was divided by two {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, longitudinal bulkheads and further transverse bulkheads dividing the ship into nineteen compartments. ''Great Eastern'' was the first ship to incorporate the [[double hull|double-skinned hull]], a feature which would not be seen again in a ship for several decades, but which is now compulsory for reasons of safety.\n\nShe had sail, paddle and screw propulsion. The paddle-wheels were {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and the four-bladed screw-propeller was {{convert|7.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The power came from four steam engines for the paddles and an additional engine for the [[propeller]]. Total power was estimated at 6 MW (8,000 [[horsepower|hp]]). The specific requirements of the Eastern Company also vindicated Brunel's initial concept of using both paddlewheels and a screw. The ''Great Britain'' had a [[chain drive]] 'overdrive' gear so that the slow-turning marine steam engines of the day could drive a screw propeller of a suitably small diameter while making the required thrust. This had proven troublesome and in his new ship Brunel resolved to use direct drive, requiring the much larger propeller.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=313}}</ref> To be effective this had to be fully submerged at all times, fixing the ship's minimum practical draught while using screw propulsion at around {{convert|7.62|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Brunel designed the ''Great Eastern'' to have a maximum draught of {{convert|9.144|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Company required that the ship be able to dock at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where navigation was restricted by the shallow [[Hooghly River]] which required a draught of no more than {{convert|7.0|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Brunel calculated that the ship would be able to carry enough coal to steam from Calcutta to a British port while not exceeding that draught, while if the ship took on coal for the final leg of her homeward voyage at [[Trincomalee]] instead she would be able to transit the Hooghly with a full load of passengers and cargo while drawing {{convert|6.09|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This would leave around half of the top-most blade of the screw clear of the water, greatly reducing the thrust it developed and the efficiency of the engines. Thus when operating at lighter loads and shallow draughts, the ''Great Eastern'' would require paddlewheels. After consultation with [[Joshua Field (engineer)|Joshua Field]], Brunel set the power of the two sets of engines so that the ''Great Eastern's'' paddlewheels provided about a third of the total mechanical propulsion, with the screw propeller providing the majority.<ref>{{harvnb|Rolt|1957|p=314}}</ref>\n\nShe also had six masts (said to be named after the days of a week \u2013 Monday being the fore mast and Saturday the [[Spanker (sail)|spanker mast]]), providing space for {{convert|1686|m2|sqft}} of sails (7 gaff and max. 9 (usually 4) square sails), rigged similar to a topsail schooner with a main gaff sail ([[fore-and-aft]] sail) on each mast, one \"jib\" on the fore mast and three square sails on masts no. 2 and no. 3 (Tuesday & Wednesday); for a time mast no. 4 was also fitted with three yards. In later years, some of the yards were removed. Her maximum speed was 24&nbsp;km/h (13 [[knot (unit)|knots]]).\n\n===Scott Russell bankruptcy===\n\nAt the beginning of February 1856, Brunel advised the Eastern Company that they should take possession of the ship to avoid it being seized by Scott Russell's creditors. This caused Scott Russell's bankers to refuse to honour his cheques and foreclose on his assets and on 4 February Scott Russell suspended all payments to his creditors and dismissed all his workmen a week later.\n\nRussell's creditors met on 12 February and it was revealed that Russell had liabilities of \u00a3122,940 and assets of \u00a3100,353. It was decided that his existing contracts would be allowed to be completed and the business would be liquidated. He issued a statement to the Board of the Eastern Company in which he repudiated his contract and effectively handed the uncompleted ship back to them. When the situation was reviewed it was found that three-quarters of the work on the hull had not been completed and that there was a deficit of 1,200 tons between the amount of iron supplied and that used on the ship.\n\nBrunel, meanwhile, wrote to John Yates and instructed him to negotiate with Scott Russell for the lease of his yard and equipment. Yates replied that Scott Russell had mortgaged the yard to his banker and that any negotiation would have to be with the bank, who after weeks of wrangling agreed to lease the yard and equipment until 12 August 1857.\n\nThe Eastern Company began the task of completing the ship. Work recommenced in May and took longer than expected to complete. Brunel reported in June 1857 that once the screw, screw shaft and sternpost had been installed the ship would be ready for launching. However, the launch ways and cradles would not be ready in time since the contract for their construction had only been placed in January 1857. Under pressure from all sides, the lease of the shipyard costing \u00a31,000 a month, and against his better judgement, Brunel agreed to launch the ship on 3 November 1857 to catch the high tide.\n\n===Launch===\n\n[[File:Great eastern launch attempt.jpg|thumb|left|''Great Eastern'' before launch in 1858]]\n[[File:Great Eastern painting smooth sea-2.jpg|right|thumb|Hand-coloured lithograph of the SS ''Great Eastern'', the great ship of IK Brunel as imagined by the artist at her launch in 1858]]\n\nBrunel had hoped to conduct the launch with a minimum of publicity but many thousands of spectators had heard of it and occupied vantage points all round the yard. He was also dismayed to discover that the Eastern Company's directors had sold 3,000 tickets for spectators to enter the shipyard.\n\nAs he was preparing for the launch, some of the directors joined him on the rostrum with a list of names for the ship. On being asked which he preferred, Brunel replied \"Call her Tom Thumb if you like\". At 12:30 pm Henrietta (daughter of a major fundraiser for the ship, [[Henry Thomas Hope]]) christened the ship ''Leviathan'' much to everyone's surprise since she was commonly known as ''Great Eastern''; her name subsequently changed back to ''Great Eastern'' in July 1858.\n\nThe launch, was however,<ref name=\"Mechanics Monthly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ikbrunel.org.uk/Mechanics-Monthly|title=Mechanics Monthly - Isambard Kingdom Brunel|work=ikbrunel.org.uk}}</ref> unsucessful as the steam winches and manual capstans used to haul the ship towards the water were not up to the job. Brunel made another attempt on the 19th and again on the 28th, this time using [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic ram]]s to move the ship, but these too proved inadequate. The ship was successfully launched sideways at 1:42pm on 31 January 1858, aided by an unusually high tide and strong winds and using more powerful hydraulic rams supplied by the then-new [[Richard Tangye|Tangye]] company of Birmingham, the association with such a famous project giving a useful fillip to the fledgling company.<ref name=\"brunel2c\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_eastern.htm|title=Brunel 200: SS Great Eastern|work=brunel200.com}}</ref>\n\nShe was {{convert|211|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, with a [[draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} unloaded and {{convert|9.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} fully laden, and displaced 32,000 tons fully loaded. In comparison, SS ''Persia'', launched in 1856, was {{convert|119|m|ft|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}} beam.\n\nThe site of launch is still partly visible these days next to Burrell's Wharf on the Isle of Dogs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Great Eastern Launch Site|url = http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Great_Eastern_Launch_Site.htm|website = www.infobritain.co.uk|access-date = 2015-10-14|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150920095231/http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Great_Eastern_Launch_Site.htm|archive-date = 20 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Suez Canal concerns===\n\nIn 1857, during the planning of the [[Suez Canal]], it was thought that ''Great Eastern'' would not be able to traverse it, since she had a draught of {{convert|28|ft|abbr=on}} and it was expected that the canal would be excavated to a depth of {{convert|26|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book| last = de Lesseps | first = Ferdinand | authorlink = Ferdinand de Lesseps | title = Inquiry into the opinions of the commercial classes of Great Britain on the Suez ship canal | publisher = John Wheal | year = 1857 | location = London | pages = [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintoopin01lessgoog/page/n76 63] | url = https://archive.org/details/inquiryintoopin01lessgoog}}</ref> In any event, when the canal was opened to shipping in 1869, ''Great Eastern'' was no longer in passenger service.\n\n===Fitting out===\n\nThe launch of the ship cost \u00a3170,000, a third of Brunel's estimate for the entire vessel, and it had yet to be fitted out. It was difficult to get any more money from the Eastern Company's investors as the company was close to bankruptcy. To prevent this from happening, a new company was formed, the \"Great Ship Company\", with capital of \u00a3340,000. They bought the ship for \u00a3160,000, which left enough funds for fitting her out. The Eastern Company's shareholders were given the market value of their \u00a320 shares (\u00a32 10s) towards payment for shares in the new company and the Eastern Steam Navigation Company entered liquidation.\n\nTenders were invited for fitting the ship out, and two were received \u2013 one from Wigram and Lucas for \u00a3142,000, and the other from John Scott Russell for \u00a3125,000. Brunel had taken a long holiday on medical advice and was absent when the contract was awarded to Scott Russell. The work was begun in January 1859, and was completed by August.\n\n===Maiden voyage===\n\n30 August 1859 was given as the date of the first voyage, but this was later put back to 6 September. The destination was [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], from which a trial trip into the Atlantic would be made. Following this the ship would sail to [[Holyhead]], Wales. The company had made an agreement with the Canada's [[Grand Trunk Railway]] to use [[Portland, Maine]] as its US destination, and the railway company had built a special jetty to accommodate the ship. [[William Harrison (merchant navy officer)|William Harrison]] was appointed Captain in 1856;{{cn|date=December 2019}} he drowned on 21 January 1860 while sailing from [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] to Southampton in the ship's boat.<ref name=S210160>{{Cite news |title=Fatal boat accident in the Southampton Docks |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=21 January 1860 |issue=11058 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Explosion on board the Great Eastern Steam Ship, off Hastings, on the 9th September, 1859 RMG PY0309.tiff|thumb|The Explosion on board the ''Great Eastern'' Steam Ship, off Hastings, on 9 September 1859]]\nOn 9 September the ship had passed down the Thames, and out into the English Channel, and had just passed [[Hastings]] when there was a huge explosion, the forward deck blowing apart with enough force to throw the No. 1 funnel into the air, followed by a rush of escaping steam. Scott Russell and two engineers went below and ordered the steam to be blown off and the engine speed reduced. Five stokers died from being scalded by hot steam, while four or five others were badly injured and one had leapt overboard and had been lost. The accident was discovered to have been caused by a feedwater heater's steam exhaust having been closed, and the explosion's power had been concentrated by the ship's strong bulkheads.<ref>{{cite book | last = Burke | first = Edmund | authorlink = Edmund Burke | title = The Annual Register | publisher = J. & F.H.

Among the passengers were the two journalists and engineers [[Zerah Colburn (locomotive designer)|Zerah Colburn]] and [[Alexander Lyman Holley]] as well as three directors of the Great Ship Company.\n\nPreparations were initially made for the ship to sail on 16 June 1860 and the passengers boarded her on the 14th. After visitors had been sent ashore the Captain (Capt. John Vine Hall) announced that he would not be sailing until the 17th, as the crew were drunk. Director [[Daniel Gooch]], who was travelling aboard her, was not pleased. He was further displeased by the route taken by the ship which was the more southerly of the regular steamer routes as he had wanted the ship to complete the journey in nine days. In the event, the voyage took 10 days 19 hours.\n\n====1861 government charter====\nUpon ''Great Eastern's'' return to England, the ship was chartered by the British Government to transport troops to [[Quebec]]. 2,144 officers and men, 473 women and children, and 200 horses were embarked at Liverpool along with 40 paying passengers. The ship sailed on 25 June 1861 and went at full speed throughout most of the trip arriving at her destination 8 days and 6 hours after leaving Liverpool. ''Great Eastern'' stayed for a month and returned to Britain at the beginning of July with 357 paying passengers.<ref>Emmerson, p. 99</ref>\n\nAlthough the ship had made around \u00a314,000 on its first Atlantic voyage, the Great Ship Company's finances were in a poor state, with their shares dropping in price. They were also threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] for not making Portland, Maine the ship's port of call as agreed.<ref>Dugan, p. 52</ref> In addition, [[John Scott Russell|Scott Russell]] had been awarded the sum of \u00a318,000 for repairs following the 1859 explosion. The Company managed to appeal against this but Scott Russell applied to the courts and the Chief Justice found in his favour. The company appealed again, and due to rumours that the ship was about to leave the country, Russell's solicitors took possession of her. The Great Ship Company lost its appeal and had to pay the sum awarded; to cover this and the expenses of a second US voyage, they raised \u00a335,000 using [[debenture]]s.<ref>Tyler, p. 323</ref>\n\n====Second voyage to North America====\n\nOnly 100 passengers booked for the second voyage, which was originally scheduled to depart [[Milford Haven]] on 1 May 1861. However, the boat taking the passengers to the ship ran aground and they and their luggage had to be rescued by small boats.\n\nThe voyage took 9 days 13 hours. ''Great Eastern'''s arrival in New York was virtually unnoticed due to the [[American Civil War]], and when it was opened to the public at 25 cents a head there was little interest. 194 passengers sailed on the return journey on 25 May and 5,000 tons of wheat was also carried.\n\n====Third voyage to North America====\n''Great Eastern'' sailed from Liverpool on Tuesday 10 September 1861, commanded by Captain James Walker. On her second day out the wind increased to [[gale]] force, causing the ship to roll heavily. The port paddle wheel was completely lost, and the starboard paddle wheel smashed to pieces when one of the lifeboats broke loose. At the same time it was discovered that the [[cast iron]] rudder post, which was {{convert|11|in|mm}} in diameter, had sheared off {{convert|2|ft|abbr=on}} above its collar and the rudder was swinging free and hitting the screw, which was slowly breaking it up.\n\nCaptain Walker ordered his officers to say nothing to the passengers concerning the situation, then had a [[trysail]] hoisted which was immediately ripped apart by the wind. He then had a four-ton [[spar (sailing)|spar]] thrown overboard secured with a [[hawser]] to try to bring some control to the ship, but it only worked for a short while before being torn away.\n\nBy the end of the second day some of the passengers had an idea as to the predicament they were in and formed a committee chaired by Liverpool shipping merchant George Oakwood. The captain agreed to meet Oakwood and allowed him to inspect the ship. What he found was far worse than had been expected: none of the cargo had been stowed properly and it was all rolling loose in the holds. Hamilton E. Towle, an American [[civil engineer]], who was returning to the States after completing his contract working as a supervising engineer on the [[Danube River]] dry-docks in Austria, visited the rudder room and after inspecting the damage came up with a plan to regain control of the rudder.\n\nTowle's scheme was taken to the captain, who failed to act on it. In the evening of the third day, ''Magnet'', a brig from [[Nova Scotia]], appeared on the scene. Captain Walker asked her captain if he would stand by. He agreed, but it turned out there was little he could do, and after several hours the brig left, later succeeding in a claim for [[demurrage]] from the Great Ship Company for the delay.\n\nTowle now presented his plan to the passengers' committee, and in turn they pressured the captain into letting him try it. Towle had a {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} chain composed of {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} links wound around the rudder post below the break, then secured the ends of the chain to the port and starboard frames of the ship using [[block and tackle]]. Two lighter chains were led down from the [[pilothouse|wheelhouse]] and attached to the heavy chain and also to the ship's frames. This allowed some limited movement of the rudder, and the ship became steerable again.<ref>{{cite book| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York | publisher = C. van Benthuysen | year = 1862 | location = | pages = [https://archive.org/details/annualreportame09unkngoog/page/n429 421]\u2013422 | url = https://archive.org/details/annualreportame09unkngoog | doi = | id = | isbn =}}</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Sunday 15 September the storm finally abated. Towle and the passengers committee insisted that the Captain try the repaired rudder and eventually the engines were started and at 5 pm that day after 75 hours of drifting out of control the ship answered the helm and was turned on to a course towards Ireland, {{convert|300|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn arrival at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] the harbourmaster refused to let the ship enter because she was not under full control and injured passengers were taken off by boats. The ship had to stand off for three days until she was towed in by [[HMS Advice (1837)|HMS ''Advice'']]. Arrangements for temporary repairs were begun and the passengers were offered free transport to the US aboard other ships. Once the repairs were completed the ship sailed to [[Milford Haven]] where permanent repairs were to be carried out. Smaller, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} paddlewheels were fitted, and improvements were made to the steering.\n\nUpon arriving in the US, Towle filed a claim for $100,000 under the laws of salvage, claiming that his efforts had saved the ship. The case was taken to court, and he was awarded the sum of $15,000, quite a considerable sum for that period. ''[[Scientific American]]'' published an account of the incident and a description of Towle's device.<ref>\"The way the Great Eastern was saved,\" ''Scientific American'', vol. 5, no. 17, pages 263\u2013264 (26 October 1861).

The ship was opened to visitors and around 3,000 a day took the opportunity. The return journey to Liverpool was profitable, with 389 passengers travelling along with 3,000 tons of freight. The west-to-east trip took 9 days 12 hours, a reduction of 12 hours on her previous record.\n\nThe second voyage of 1862 saw the ship arriving in New York on 11 July with 376 passengers including the President of [[Liberia]], [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts|J. J. Roberts]]. The return journey later that month carried 500 passengers and 8,000 tons of cargo, the ship arriving at Liverpool on 7 August.\n\n====Great Eastern Rock incident====\n''Great Eastern'' left Liverpool on 17 August with 1,530 passengers on board and a substantial amount of freight which increased her draught to {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nNot wishing to enter [[New York Bay]] over [[Sandy Hook]] bar due to the ship's deep draught, the captain decided to steam up [[Long Island Sound]] and moor at [[Flushing Bay, New York|Flushing Bay]]. The [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] came on board at 1:30 am and the ship moved slowly ahead. At about 2:00 am {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} east of [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]], [[Long Island]] a rumble was heard and the ship heeled slightly. The pilot said she had probably rubbed against the \"North East Ripps\" (later renamed \"Great Eastern Rock\"). The captain sent an officer down to check for damage and he reported no leaks. The ship had a list to [[Port (nautical)|port]], but made her way into New York the next day under her own steam.\n\nIt was discovered that the rock had opened a gash in the ship's outer hull over {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|83|ft|m}} long. The enormous size of ''Great Eastern'' precluded the use of any drydock repair facility in the US, and the brothers Henry and [[Edward S. Renwick]] devised a daring plan to build a watertight, {{convert|104|by|15|ft|m}} [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D.

The brothers claimed that it would take two weeks to complete the repairs and said that they would only take payment if successful. The demands of the [[American Civil War]] caused delays in getting the iron plates required, and instead of two weeks the repairs took three months at a cost to the company of \u00a370,000.

One of her paddle wheels was damaged on the last outward trip and she completed it using her screw, while on the return journey she ran down and damaged ''Jane'', a small sailing ship. The company lost nearly \u00a320,000 on the voyages due to a price war between the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and [[Inman Line|Inman]] shipping lines, and ended up with debts of more than \u00a3142,000, which forced them to lay up ''Great Eastern''.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}\n\n===Sale===\n[[File:Great Eastern Milford Haven 2.JPG|thumb|''Great Eastern'' harboured in [[Milford Haven]], 1870s]]\n\nA plan was mooted to offer the ship in a lottery, which came to nothing, and the ship was finally offered for sale on 14 January 1864 at the [[Liverpool Exchange]], the bidding opening at \u00a350,000.

The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell.

The program aired on the station since 1981 (when it was still WVBF).<ref name=tbg-landw2001>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Clea|title=Loren and Wally: 20 years on air|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201610/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, Wally Brine announced his retirement.<ref>http://wror.com/wally/#thanksservingb Wally Set To Retire His Alarm Clock! </ref>  Hank Morse was let go on June 24, 2019, a few days before the show concluded.  Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]). Doyle's sports-related songs have occasionally gained airplay on other stations during championship seasons. During the holiday season, Tom often sings parodies of classic Christmas songs.\n\nOther Townie Tunes include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Townie Tune\n!

WKOX-FM was the Boston area's first FM top 40 station featuring live [[disc jockey]]s, including hosts Bill Thomas, Brother Bill Heizer, FM Douglas, program director Dick Stevens, John Leisher, Alan Fraser, J. William Charles, with Kenny McKay and Jimmy Conlee. WKOX-FM converted to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo broadcasting]] that July.\n\n===WVBF (1971-1993)===\n{{Distinguish||text=Middleborough Center, Massachusetts radio station [[WVBF]]}}\nWKOX and WKOX-FM were acquired by Fairbanks Communications in July 1971. After the sale, WKOX-FM became WVBF (also known as the ''Electronic Mama''), as a hybrid top 40/rock station, initially retaining some of the WKOX-FM personalities. The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell.

Confusion with other FM stations and [[WCVB-TV]] led to a call sign change to WKLB in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, WKLB was to be sold to Evergreen Media, and was widely expected to become a talk station. However, a series of subsequent trades in 1996 placed WKLB under common ownership with WBCS via Greater Media.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403763793.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+15%2C+1996&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe&edition=&startpage=23&desc=WBCS-FM+owners+to+take+over+WKLB-FM/ WBCS-FM owners to take over WKLB-FM], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', June 15, 1996</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 1996, the intellectual property of WKLB \"merged\" with WBCS, with the newly merged country station utilizing the 96.9 frequency of WBCS along with the WKLB call letters, combining personalities from both stations.

Leading broadcasters involved with WROR in the 1970s and early 1980s included program director [[Gary Berkowitz]] and personalities such as: Joe Martell, Phil Redo, Larry Justice, Frank Kingston Smith, and current WROR General Manager Tom Baker.\n\nBy 1999, the format had been modified to classic rock, similar to co-owned [[WMGK]] in [[Philadelphia]], but gradually moved back to more of a pop-based classic hits format in 2006, emphasizing pop adult rock hits while mixing in some R&B, disco, and harder rock songs. The station continues to emphasize the 1970s and 1980s, but also plays some well-known 1960s and 1990s hits. WROR became the market's lone classic hits station in 2012 following [[WODS]]'s format switch to top 40.

(Doyle was let go on November 19, 2014.) The program aired on the station since 1981 (when it was still WVBF).<ref name=tbg-landw2001>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Clea|title=Loren and Wally: 20 years on air|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201610/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, Wally Brine announced his retirement.<ref>http://wror.com/wally/#thanksservingb Wally Set To Retire His Alarm Clock! </ref>  Hank Morse was let go on June 24, 2019, a few days before the show concluded.  Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]). Doyle's sports-related songs have occasionally gained airplay on other stations during championship seasons. During the holiday season, Tom often sings parodies of classic Christmas songs.\n\nOther Townie Tunes include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Townie Tune\n!

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area.

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, Black people identified by the white possessors of the enslaved as able-bodied, physically fit, and perceived to be in their prime working and reproductive years were categorized as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it. The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm|title=Network to Freedom Homepage|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival in Canada===\n[[File:UndergroundRailroadmonumentWindsor.jpg|175px|thumb|''International Underground Railroad Memorial'' in [[Windsor, Ontario]]]]\n[[File:John Brown by Levin Handy, 1890-1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] participated in the Underground Railroad as an abolitionist.]]\n\nEstimates vary widely, but at least 30,000 slaves, and potentially more than 100,000, escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web| url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166| work=[[Historica Minutes]]| quote=Between 1840 and 1860, more than 30,000 American slaves came secretly to Canada and freedom| title=Settling Canada Underground Railroad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106114439/http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166 |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=January 30, 2018 }}</ref> The largest group settled in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario), called [[Canada West]] from 1841.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 379</ref> Numerous [[Black Canadian]] communities developed in [[Southern Ontario]].

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\". Slavery in [[Upper Canada]] (now Ontario) was outlawed in 1793; in 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], the Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| title=Black History-From Slavery to Settlement| website=Archives.gov.on.ca| accessdate=June 7, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214020850/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| archivedate=February 14, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref> protect their freedom.

The pilot episode of the show was broadcast on 22 February 1980 on [[BNT 1|BNT 1]] with the original plan was for only five episodes to be aired. Due to high viewers' interest however, the show remains on air. The 100th episode, aired on 25 December 1987, was meant as the series' final episode, but on 3 April 1992, by invitation from the [[Bulgarian National Television]]'s directors, the show was re-launched on Channel 1 (formerly BNT 1). In 1993 the show wins the BNT award for the best television game show.\n\nIn 2003 the production goes from being directly produced by the BNT to different production company - TV Box. The show continued to be part of BNT 1's broadcasting schedule until its cancellation on 31 December 2011.

The pilot episode of the show was broadcast on 22 February 1980 on [[BNT 1|BNT 1]] with the original plan was for only five episodes to be aired. Due to high viewers' interest however, the show remains on air. The 100th episode, aired on 25 December 1987, was meant as the series' final episode, but on 3 April 1992, by invitation from the [[Bulgarian National Television]]'s directors, the show was re-launched on Channel 1 (formerly BNT 1). In 1993 the show wins the BNT award for the best television game show.\n\nIn 2003 the production goes from being directly produced by the BNT to different production company - TV Box. The show continued to be part of BNT 1's broadcasting schedule until its cancellation on 31 December 2011.

More than 300 people have died attempting to reach the summit. The last year without known deaths on the mountain was 1977, a year in which only two people reached the summit.<ref name=record>{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/everestsummits/summitsbyyear.htm |title=Summits by Year |publisher=everesthistory.com|accessdate=2015-07-10}}</ref>\n\nMost deaths have been attributed to [[avalanche]]s, falls, [[serac]] collapse, exposure, frostbite, or health problems related to conditions on the mountain. Not all bodies have been located, so details on those deaths are not available.\n\nThe upper reaches of the mountain are in the [[death zone]]. The death zone is a [[mountaineering]] term for [[altitude]]s above a certain point \u2013 around {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, or less than {{convert|356|mbar|psi}} of [[atmospheric pressure]] \u2013 where the oxygen level is not sufficient to sustain human life.<ref name=\"PBS p.\">{{harvnb|PBS|1998}}</ref> Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (unwise decisions made under stress or physical weakening leading to accidents).\nIn the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize, as it uses oxygen faster than it can be replenished. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and death.If you do decide to climb Mount Everest, be careful and go prepared.

In 2010, he began serving as [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]]'s lead announcer for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', calling his first Super Bowl in [[Super Bowl XLV]]. He has broadcast 10 consecutive Super Bowls for Westwood One, Super Bowls XLV-LIV. Ten is the most consecutively in radio, and television, network history (Jack Buck broadcast 9 straight.) Harlan also broadcast the CBS HD feed of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] in 2001. He also calls the preseason games of his hometown Packers for the team's statewide television network since 2003.  In 2017 and 2019, he was voted the National Sportscaster of the Year by his peers.  In all, Harlan has broadcast 11 Super Bowls and 5 Final Fours.\n\n==Biography==\nHarlan began broadcasting as a teenager for his alma mater [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Our Lady of Premontre High School]]'s [[high school radio]] [[radio station|station]], [[WGBP-FM]], calling play-by-play for the school's boy's basketball, football and ice hockey teams. He was a ball boy with the [[Green Bay Packers]] in his teens during the time that his father, [[Bob Harlan]], was a Packers executive in the front office.  He had originally pursued attending either the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] or the [[University of Notre Dame]] in pursuit of his communications/mass media degree, but a personal recommendation from broadcaster [[Gary Bender]] to his dad Bob led Kevin to instead attend the [[University of Kansas]] and its School of Journalism and Mass Communications. Harlan was introduced to the Jayhawks' primary basketball play-by-play announcer at the time, Tom Hedrick, who audited Harlan's zeal for sports broadcasting and immediately considered him a [[Mentorship|protege]] in the making. Hedrick gave Harlan a sideline position his freshman year, eventually deeming him as his [[understudy]] and fill-in announcer on days where he had other commitments.<ref name=\"doughertygbpg\">{{cite news|url=http://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/dougherty/2018/02/18/dougherty-elite-company-green-bays-kevin-harlan/342815002/?hootPostID=e821253793adbc48239a4f03a80d2a67|title=Elite company for Green Bay's Kevin Harlan|last=Dougherty|first=Pete|date=February 18, 2018|work=[[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref> Harlan graduated in 1982 with a broadcast journalism degree.  \n\nIn 1982, right out of college, at age 22, he became the TV and radio voice of the NBA's Kansas City Kings (now the [[Sacramento Kings]]). He then was a basketball announcer for his alma mater, the [[University of Kansas]], for one year, then went on to call games for the NFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] from 1985&ndash;93 after several years hosting and producing surrounding pre-game and post-game programming while still in college.  Harlan also split time with the [[University of Missouri]] (1986&ndash;89) calling football and basketball games, and worked as the play-by-play voice of the NBA's [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for nine seasons (1989&ndash;98).  On the network level, Harlan called NFL football for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in 1991, college football for [[ESPN College Football|ESPN]] in 1992&ndash;93, NFL for [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] from 1994&ndash;97, and joined [[Turner Sports]] in 1996 to broadcast NBA playoff games (he would begin calling games throughout the entire season in 1997, which he continues to do to this day). He began working for CBS in 1998.<ref name=CBS>{{cite web|title=CBS Sports TV Team |url=http://www.cbssports.com/cbssports/team/kharlan |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729115906/http://www.cbssports.com/cbssports/team/kharlan |archivedate=July 29, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"doughertygbpg\"></ref>\n\nIn addition, Harlan has called [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] preseason games; basketball games during the now-defunct [[Goodwill Games]], which were owned by [[Time Warner]]; college sports on [[ESPN]]; and several bowl games during college football seasons. Harlan has also lent his voice on the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' video game series since 2005.\n\nIn 2017, Harlan was voted by his peers National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA.<ref name=\"doughertygbpg\"/> He again was voted National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA in 2019. \nHe was also named 2019 National Sportscaster of the Year by The Athletic.  In September 2019 Harlan was inducted into the Notre Dame Academy High School Hall of Fame (the former Premontre HS he attended in Green Bay, Wisconsin.)\n\n== Notable calls ==\nHarlan has a history of injecting humor into situations during games whenever he can, in addition to being able to dramatize even mundane moments not related to the game itself. These include:\n\n'''May 12, 2008 \u2013''' Harlan was calling the 2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals featuring the [[Boston Celtics]] and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], when Cavaliers superstar [[LeBron James]] drove to the basket and emphatically dunked on Celtics forward [[Kevin Garnett]]. Harlan's call of the play:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.blogspot.com/2008/05/lebron-james-has-no-regard-for-human.html |title=Lebron James \"Has No Regard For Human Life!\" |date=2008-05-12 |website=Awful Announcing |access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>'''Harlan:''' Garnett comes out on LeBron. Now they switch and here's Pierce again...a Smith screen. Posey will defend...'''OHHHHHH! LEBRON JAMES WITH ''NO REGARD'' FOR HUMAN LIFE!'''</blockquote>\n\n'''September 12, 2016 \u2013''' Harlan was the radio play-by-play man for [[Westwood One]]'s coverage of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], where a fan ran onto the field. Harlan then proceeded to give a play-by-play of security chasing the man. Deadspin referred to the call as an \"All Timer\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/kevin-harlans-play-by-play-radio-call-of-the-mnf-idiot-1786562558|title=Kevin Harlan's Play-By-Play Radio Call Of The MNF Idiot On The Field Is An All-Timer|last=Burke|first=Timothy|website=deadspin.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref><blockquote>\"Hey, somebody has run out on the field.

''[Pause] Whew,'' that was the most exciting thing to happen tonight.\"</blockquote>\n\n'''January 12, 2018 \u2013''' Harlan called the NFC Divisional Match-up between the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] for [[Westwood One|Westwood One Radio]], where [[Stefon Diggs]] scored on a 61 yard touchdown pass from [[Case Keenum]] as time expired, now known as the [[Minneapolis Miracle]]. <blockquote>It's third down and 10. Keenum is in the gun from his own 39. Four man front, six in the secondary. Shotgun snap. He moves up, he moves up, he throws a long line drive on the near side, leaping to and catch made! '''It's made by \u2013 oh my goodness, it's gonna go in for the touchdown! Grabbed by Diggs! He broke a tackle! 61 yard touchdown throw! THE VIKINGS HAVE WON! THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS HAVE WON!'''</blockquote>\n\n'''May 12, 2019 \u2013''' Harlan called Game 7 of the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals]] with analyst [[Greg Anthony]], where [[Kawhi Leonard]] hit a shot at the buzzer that bounced four times before falling in to win the game and advance the [[Toronto Raptors]] to the Eastern Conference Finals. Harlan's call of the play:<blockquote>'''Harlan:''' It's off to Leonard, defended by Simmons. Is this the dagger?\n\n''[ball bounces four times on the rim, proceeds to go in as buzzer sounds]''\n\n'''Harlan and Anthony: OHHHHHH!'''\n\n'''Harlan: GAME! SERIES!

With Baltimore up 28\u201313 against Cincinnati, Ravens quarterback and MVP favorite [[Lamar Jackson]] used a spin move to elude several Bengals defenders for a 47-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, putting the game out of reach. \n\n<blockquote>\"Here's a second down and 3, Jackson takes it himself.

And they're at the New England four yard line, first and goal. 29 seconds left. Here (in Kansas City) [[Harrison Butker|Butker]] kicks the extra point. And [[Ryan Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick]] throws in the end zone, '''touchdown Miami! The Dolphins have just scored! [[Mike Gesicki|Gesicki]], the tight end, got a laser in the back of the end zone on a goal-to-go touchdown pass by Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to take a lead with 24 seconds to go!'''

In 2010, he began serving as [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]]'s lead announcer for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', calling his first Super Bowl in [[Super Bowl XLV]]. He has broadcast 10 consecutive Super Bowls for Westwood One, Super Bowls XLV-LIV. Ten is the most consecutively in radio, and television, network history (Jack Buck broadcast 9 straight.) Harlan also broadcast the CBS HD feed of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] in 2001. He also calls the preseason games of his hometown Packers for the team's statewide television network since 2003.  In 2017 and 2019, he was voted the National Sportscaster of the Year by his peers.  In all, Harlan has broadcasted 11 Super Bowls and 5 Final Fours.\n\n==Biography==\nHarlan began broadcasting as a teenager for his alma mater [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Our Lady of Premontre High School]]'s [[high school radio]] [[radio station|station]], [[WGBP-FM]], calling play-by-play for the school's boy's basketball, football and ice hockey teams. He was a ball boy with the [[Green Bay Packers]] in his teens during the time that his father, [[Bob Harlan]], was a Packers executive in the front office.  He had originally pursued attending either the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] or the [[University of Notre Dame]] in pursuit of his communications/mass media degree, but a personal recommendation from broadcaster [[Gary Bender]] to his dad Bob led Kevin to instead attend the [[University of Kansas]] and its School of Journalism and Mass Communications. Harlan was introduced to the Jayhawks' primary basketball play-by-play announcer at the time, Tom Hedrick, who audited Harlan's zeal for sports broadcasting and immediately considered him a [[Mentorship|protege]] in the making. Hedrick gave Harlan a sideline position his freshman year, eventually deeming him as his [[understudy]] and fill-in announcer on days where he had other commitments.<ref name=\"doughertygbpg\">{{cite news|url=http://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/dougherty/2018/02/18/dougherty-elite-company-green-bays-kevin-harlan/342815002/?hootPostID=e821253793adbc48239a4f03a80d2a67|title=Elite company for Green Bay's Kevin Harlan|last=Dougherty|first=Pete|date=February 18, 2018|work=[[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref> Harlan graduated in 1982 with a broadcast journalism degree.  \n\nIn 1982, right out of college, at age 22, he became the TV and radio voice of the NBA's Kansas City Kings (now the [[Sacramento Kings]]). He then was a basketball announcer for his alma mater, the [[University of Kansas]], for one year, then went on to call games for the NFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] from 1985&ndash;93 after several years hosting and producing surrounding pre-game and post-game programming while still in college.  Harlan also split time with the [[University of Missouri]] (1986&ndash;89) calling football and basketball games, and worked as the play-by-play voice of the NBA's [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for nine seasons (1989&ndash;98).  On the network level, Harlan called NFL football for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in 1991, college football for [[ESPN College Football|ESPN]] in 1992&ndash;93, NFL for [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] from 1994&ndash;97, and joined [[Turner Sports]] in 1996 to broadcast NBA playoff games (he would begin calling games throughout the entire season in 1997, which he continues to do to this day). He began working for CBS in 1998.<ref name=CBS>{{cite web|title=CBS Sports TV Team |url=http://www.cbssports.com/cbssports/team/kharlan |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729115906/http://www.cbssports.com/cbssports/team/kharlan |archivedate=July 29, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"doughertygbpg\"></ref>\n\nIn addition, Harlan has called [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] preseason games; basketball games during the now-defunct [[Goodwill Games]], which were owned by [[Time Warner]]; college sports on [[ESPN]]; and several bowl games during college football seasons. Harlan has also lent his voice on the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' video game series since 2005.\n\nIn 2017, Harlan was voted by his peers National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA.<ref name=\"doughertygbpg\"/> He again was voted National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA in 2019. \nHe was also named 2019 National Sportscaster of the Year by The Athletic.  In September 2019 Harlan was inducted into the Notre Dame Academy High School Hall of Fame (the former Premontre HS he attended in Green Bay, Wisconsin.)\n\n== Notable calls ==\nHarlan has a history of injecting humor into situations during games whenever he can, in addition to being able to dramatize even mundane moments not related to the game itself. These include:\n\n'''May 12, 2008 \u2013''' Harlan was calling the 2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals featuring the [[Boston Celtics]] and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], when Cavaliers superstar [[LeBron James]] drove to the basket and emphatically dunked on Celtics forward [[Kevin Garnett]].

Harlan then proceeded to give a play-by-play of security chasing the man.

Keenum is in the gun from his own 39. Four man front, six in the secondary. Shotgun snap. He moves up, he moves up, he throws a long line drive on the near side, leaping to and catch made!

THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS HAVE WON!'''</blockquote>\n\n'''May 12, 2019 \u2013''' Harlan called Game 7 of the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals]] with analyst [[Greg Anthony]], where [[Kawhi Leonard]] hit a shot at the buzzer that bounced four times before falling in to win the game and advance the [[Toronto Raptors]] to the Eastern Conference Finals. Harlan's call of the play:<blockquote>'''Harlan:''' It's off to Leonard, defended by Simmons. Is this the dagger?\n\n''[ball bounces four times on the rim, proceeds to go in as buzzer sounds]''\n\n'''Harlan and Anthony: OHHHHHH!'''\n\n'''Harlan: GAME! SERIES!

And they're at the New England four yard line, first and goal. 29 seconds left. Here (in Kansas City) [[Harrison Butker|Butker]] kicks the extra point.

Her art mainly was influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist movements. McGillivray lived in Toronto and Ottawa but travelled often to pursue transforming the reality of nature into her work. She visited Europe, Alaska, Jamaica and Trinidad. Exhibition locations include Toronto Malloney's, Continental Galleries, Montreal, and her own studio in her hometown.\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and galleries in Oshawa, Whitby, Kitchener, London, and Windsor all hold her work in their collections.

She is the second youngest child of Scottish immigrant farmer, George McGillivray (1813-1894) and his wife, Caroline Amelia Fothergill McGillivray (1828-1909). McGillivray had three siblings; Elizabeth Fothergill McGillivray Hillary (1847-1877), Mary Eliza McGillivray (1849-1911) and William McGillivray (1865-1904).\n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

She had a brilliant and unusual handling of brushwork that created unique compositions.<ref name=\":2\" /> In her earlier career, she painted china after studying at the pottery studio of Marshall Fry, in New York, and sold her pieces from her studio in Whitby where she also gave painting lessons.\n\nShe was one of the first women artists to explore landscapes of the wilderness of Ontario and Quebec. She was part of the small group of artists that liked the romantic-realist view of the railway artists and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s that characterized the work of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and their adherents following the [[World War I|Great War]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=By a Lady: Celebrating Three Centuries of Art by Canadian Women|last=Tippett|first=Maria|publisher=Viking|year=1992|isbn=0140169555|location=Toronto|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/byladycelebratin0000tipp}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her life, she travelled around Canada, the United States, Jamaica, Trinidad, the Bahamas and Europe, to France, England and Italy, looking for new and challenging landscapes to paint.\n\n[[File:Contentment, c. 1914 Florence H.

The artist traveled around Canada for inspiration in order to challenge the core definition of reality through disarranging objects from the precise manner.<ref name=\":1\" /> She mimics the environment around her and expresses it through bold colours and contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through large amount of paint applied by a palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working with the outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career as a contemporary artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including journeying through her hometown in Whitby, Gatineau Valley <ref name=\":0\" /> and her voyage through Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> The painter was seen as a contemporary artist working with several media which includes watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art.  Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

McGillivray had three siblings; Elizabeth Fothergill McGillivray Hillary (1847-1877), Mary Eliza McGillivray (1849-1911) and William McGillivray (1865-1904).\n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

She was part of the small group of artists that liked the romantic-realist view of the railway artists and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s that characterized the work of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and their adherents following the [[World War I|Great War]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=By a Lady: Celebrating Three Centuries of Art by Canadian Women|last=Tippett|first=Maria|publisher=Viking|year=1992|isbn=0140169555|location=Toronto|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/byladycelebratin0000tipp}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her life, she travelled around Canada, the United States, Jamaica, Trinidad, the Bahamas and Europe, to France, England and Italy, looking for new and challenging landscapes to paint.\n\n[[File:Contentment, c. 1914 Florence H.

The artist traveled around Canada for inspiration in order to challenge the core definition of reality through disarranging objects from the precise manner.<ref name=\":1\" /> She mimics the environment around her and expresses it through bold colours and contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through large amount of paint applied by a palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working with the outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career as a contemporary artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including journeying through her hometown in Whitby, Gatineau Valley <ref name=\":0\" /> and her voyage through Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> The painter was seen as a contemporary artist working with several media which includes watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art.  Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

Lee showed glimpses of his best form {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2\u20131, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.\n\nBy the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like [[Peter Siddle]], [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] and [[Doug Bollinger]] ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.\n\n====Retirement====\nLee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival [[Andrew Flintoff]], stating that bowling \"at 150&nbsp;km/h for five days is very hard on the body\".<ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Flintoff convinces Brett Lee to call stumps|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/freddie-convinces-lee-to-call-stumps-20100222-orxr.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 February 2010}}</ref> He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008.

He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], he scored his first ODI [[half century]], 51* not out.\n\nIn One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2006/feb/08ranks.htm Lee, Gilchrist Top ICC ODI Rankings].

He also has a One-day International [[hat-trick]] to his name, achieved in the [[2003 cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] against [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]]. Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] history.\n\nIn the matches Australia played in the [[2005-2006 Australian cricket season|2005\u201306]] [[2005\u201306 VB Series|triangular one day series]], Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with [[Michael Hussey]] to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind [[Nathan Bracken]] and [[Muttiah Muralitharan]].\n\nHis bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and [[wicket-keeper]] [[Adam Gilchrist]] yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283729.html|title=Records - One-Day Internationals - Bowling records - Bowler/fielder combinations - ESPNcricinfo|publisher=|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n====2003 World Cup====\nWith main bowler [[Shane Warne]] banned from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with [[Andy Bichel]] and [[Glenn McGrath]], formed one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 [[wickets]] off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lankan]] left-arm fastbowler [[Chaminda Vaas]].

In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling {{convert|5|km/h|abbr=on}} slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook [[Jason Gillespie]] to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]], 2007\u201308. He capped off the season by winning the [[Allan Border Medal]], the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer of the past year.\n\nLee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.\n\nDuring the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best form {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2\u20131, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.\n\nBy the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like [[Peter Siddle]], [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] and [[Doug Bollinger]] ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.\n\n====Retirement====\nLee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival [[Andrew Flintoff]], stating that bowling \"at 150&nbsp;km/h for five days is very hard on the body\".<ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Flintoff convinces Brett Lee to call stumps|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/freddie-convinces-lee-to-call-stumps-20100222-orxr.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 February 2010}}</ref> He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008.

He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], he scored his first ODI [[half century]], 51* not out.\n\nIn One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2006/feb/08ranks.htm Lee, Gilchrist Top ICC ODI Rankings].

He also has a One-day International [[hat-trick]] to his name, achieved in the [[2003 cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] against [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]]. Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] history.\n\nIn the matches Australia played in the [[2005-2006 Australian cricket season|2005\u201306]] [[2005\u201306 VB Series|triangular one day series]], Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with [[Michael Hussey]] to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse.
