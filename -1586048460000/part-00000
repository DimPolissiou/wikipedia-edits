The auditorium is large enough to hold two [[Boeing 747]]s side by side.

Hinckley]]'s request.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Hinckley was then a counselor in the First Presidency, but became [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] in 1995. The LDS Church originally sought a 26,000-seat building no more than 75 feet (23 m) high in accord with [[zoning]] regulations for the LDS Church-owned 10 acre (40,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) block immediately north of [[Temple Square]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Hinckley publicly announced the project in the April 1996 general conference. The final plans, completed in late 1996, featured 21,200 seats in the main hall with 905 in the side theater.\n\nContracting for the building was done by three Salt Lake City firms: Jacobsen, Layton, and Okland construction companies which submitted a joint bid in order to compete with national firms. The companies jointly operated under the name \"Legacy Constructors\" after winning the contract in late 1996.\n\nDemolition of existing LDS Church properties on the site began May 1997. Deseret Gym&mdash;a [[YMCA]]-like [[gym]]nasium&mdash;and a Mormon Handicraft store had to be razed for the project.\n\nGround was broken July 24, 1997. This date coincided with the 150th anniversary of [[Mormon pioneer]]s entering the [[Salt Lake Valley]], an event celebrated in Utah as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].\n\n=== Little Cottonwood Canyon controversy ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n[[Image:Lds conference center panoramic view slc utah.jpg|thumb|400px|Conference Center from its southwest corner]]\nAlthough the Conference Center is a modern [[steel]] [[truss]] and [[rebar]]-based design without need for [[masonry]] support, the LDS Church sought slabs of [[quartz monzonite]], a form of granite, to clad all exterior walls. Specifically, the church wanted granite to match rock quarried more than a hundred years earlier to build the adjacent [[Salt Lake Temple]]. Therefore, the LDS Church requested a permit to quarry granite from [[Little Cottonwood Canyon]] southeast of Salt Lake City. The [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] Commission granted a two-year permit on condition that extraction not interfere with the [[skiing|ski]] season. Critics of the extraction argued that the quarry harmed the environment and burdened residents while endangering drivers through Little Cottonwood Canyon below.\n\nQuarrying began May 28, 1998. The quarry location was further up the canyon from where stone was extracted for the Salt Lake Temple.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunt |first=Kathie |date=July 14, 1999 |title=LDS Church given approval to extend quarry |url=https://universe.byu.edu/1999/07/14/lds-church-given-approval-to-extend-quarry/ |work=Daily Universe/BYU NewsNet |location=Provo, Utah |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> Although court filings challenged the legality of extracting the granite (specifically attacking Salt Lake County's authority to issue permit), the project was interrupted only by winter weather. The LDS Church finished quarrying by November 1999. Over 300,000 square feet (28,000 m\u00b2) of granite was extracted. The granite was subsequently cut into slabs at a facility in Idaho Falls and used for the facade of the building.  There was not enough granite extracted from the Little Cottonwood Canyon quarry for the entire project, so extra granite was brought in from the mid-west and used for the flooring.\n\n=== Completion ===\nThe exceptionally unusual [[Salt Lake City Tornado]] hindered construction on August 11, 1999. Construction cranes toppled at the work site, and four injuries to crew were reported. Otherwise, construction proceeded smoothly and rapidly.\n\nConstruction was complete enough for the building to be used for the 170th annual general conference on April 1 and 2, 2000. The [[pipe organ]] was not operational, so [[The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square]] was accompanied by a [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] organ amplified through the Center's speaker system.  President Hinckley remarked in his opening address that over 370,000 people had inquired about tickets for the Center's inaugural general conference. President Hinckley also related that a [[black walnut]] tree that he had planted decades earlier in his backyard provided wood for the pulpit of the new center.\n\nThe Conference Center was ''dedicated'' six months later, on October 8, during the 170th semiannual general conference. As part of the event, the dedicatory prayer was followed by a \"[[hosanna shout]]\"&mdash;a show of gratitude that dates to the early days of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The shout involves participants waving white [[handkerchief]]s while repeating \"Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna, to God and the Lamb\" three times. Though it had been used in public before, such as during the capstone ceremony for the [[Salt Lake Temple]] and at the church centennial celebration in 1930, before this public broadcast of the hosanna shout, some assumed it was exclusively related to [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]] dedications, which are inaccessible to non-Mormons. The Conference Center dedication demonstrated that the hosanna shout, although considered sacred by the Latter-day Saints, is not necessarily used exclusively in temple-related settings.\n\n=== Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center ===\n\n''Magnum Opus: The Building of the Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center'' by [[John Longhurst]], retired Senior Tabernacle Organist, examines the concept, approval, design, and construction of the [[Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center|Conference center organ]] seen during general conferences of the church.

Construction cranes toppled at the work site, and four injuries to crew were reported. Otherwise, construction proceeded smoothly and rapidly.\n\nConstruction was complete enough for the building to be used for the 170th annual church general conference on April 1 and 2, 2000. The [[pipe organ]] was not operational, so [[The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square]] was accompanied by a [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] organ amplified through the Center's speaker system.  President Hinckley remarked in his opening address that over 370,000 people had inquired about tickets for the Center's inaugural general conference. President Hinckley also related that a [[black walnut]] tree that he had planted decades earlier in his backyard provided wood for the pulpit of the new center.\n\nThe Conference Center was ''dedicated'' six months later, on October 8, during the 170th semiannual general conference. As part of the event, the dedicatory prayer was followed by a \"[[hosanna shout]]\"&mdash;a show of gratitude that dates to the early days of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The shout involves participants waving white [[handkerchief]]s while repeating \"Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna, to God and the Lamb\" three times. Though it had been used in public before, such as during the capstone ceremony for the [[Salt Lake Temple]] and at the church centennial celebration in 1930, before this public broadcast of the hosanna shout, some assumed it was exclusively related to [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]] dedications, which are inaccessible to non-Mormons. The Conference Center dedication demonstrated that the hosanna shout, although considered sacred by the Latter-day Saints, is not necessarily used exclusively in temple-related settings.\n\n=== Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center ===\n\n''Magnum Opus: The Building of the Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center'' by [[John Longhurst]], retired Senior Tabernacle Organist, examines the concept, approval, design, and construction of the [[Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center|Conference center organ]] seen during general conferences of the church.  The book contains color pictures and an audio CD with narrative by the organ builder and music illustrations by the Tabernacle organists.<ref>{{citation |last1= Longhurst |first1= John |author1-link= John Longhurst |last2= Bethards |first2= Jack M. |year= 2009 |title=Magnum Opus: The Building of the Schoenstein Organ At the Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] |isbn= 9781606411995 |oclc= 416718321 |page= }}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{cleanup gallery}}\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Conference Center east lobby Salt Lake City.jpg|East lobby\nImage:Auditorium organ conference center slc.jpg|Organ and stage\nImage:Balcony level lobby conference center.jpg|Balcony level lobby\nImage:First floor lobby conference center slc.jpg|First floor lobby\nImage:Conference center main lobby slc utah.jpg|Main lobby from balcony level\nImage:Balcony level conference center slc utah.jpg|Balcony level\nImage:North side lds conference center.jpg|North side\nImage:Conference center roof.jpg|[[Green roof]]\nImage:USA, Utah, Salt Lake City, Conference Center (LDS Church), roof.jpg|Rooftop view.

Founded in 1896, it is Alabama's only public [[liberal arts college]] and a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]]. The [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was established in 1979 and included 16 buildings on campus. It was expanded in 1990 to include 75 buildings total.\n\n==History==\n[[File:King House University of Montevallo Montevallo, AL.JPG|thumb|left|Built in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in 1823, the King House is the oldest building on campus,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080440/http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places in Shelby County, Alabama|National Register of Historic Places]] on January 14, 1972.]]\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name           = Alabama Girls' Industrial School\n| nrhp_type      = hd\n| image          = King Quad.jpg\n| caption        = King Quad at the University of Montevallo<br>University of Montevallo campus\n| location       = Bounded by Middle Campus Dr., Oak, Bloch and Middle Sts., [[Montevallo, Alabama]]\n| locmapin       = Alabama\n| built          = 1851\n| architect      = \n| architecture   = Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Federal\n| added          = December 11, 1978\n| area           = {{convert|25.7|acre}}\n| governing_body = Local\n| refnum         = 78000509<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n| nocat          = yes\n}}\nThe main part of the campus was designed by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted brothers]] and the central part is a historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The university opened in October 1896 as the Alabama Girls' Industrial School (AGIS), a women-only [[technical school]] that also offered [[high school]]-level courses. AGIS became the Alabama Girls' Technical Institute in 1911, further adding \"and College for Women\" in 1919. The school gradually developed as a traditional degree-granting institution, becoming '''Alabama College''', State College for Women in 1923.\n\nThe school effectively became [[coeducation]]al after lobbying by the school's supporters resulted in the [[Alabama Legislature]] passing a bill on January 15, 1956 to remove the designation \"State College for Women\". The first men entered the school that same month. Its student body still maintains a 7:5 ratio of women to men.\n\nIn 1965, the board of trustees authorized President D.P. Culp to sign the Certificates of Assurance of Compliance with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=ency>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1827 Encyclopedia of Alabama: University of Montevallo], accessed 2010-05-16.</ref> In the fall of 1968, three African American women, Carolyn Burpo, Ruby Kennbrew and Dorothy (Lilly) Turner, enrolled in the university.<ref name=ency/> On September 1, 1969, Alabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo.\n\nThe [[Alabama Girls' Industrial School]] was listed on the National Register in 1978. In 1990, the [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was listed on the National Register, as an expansion.\n\nMontevallo is in the geographic center of [[Alabama]] in an area rich with [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history. Many of the buildings on campus predate the founding of the college, including King House (reserved for special guests of the campus) and Reynolds Hall (used by the Theater Department and alumni relations). King House was reportedly the first home in Alabama to receive pane glass windows. With nearly 3,000 students, the university has a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]].\n\n==Traditions==\n\n=== College Night ===\nThe University of Montevallo's [[homecoming]] tradition is called '''College Night''', a coeducational competition in which students may participate for either the Purple Side or the Gold Side, named after the school's colors. The tradition of College Night began as a celebration of the upcoming renaming of Alabama Girls' Technical Institute to Alabama College. First taking place on March 3, 1919, as a competition between the four classes, the Class of 1919 said that \"now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/technala121919unse/page/n31/mode/2up</ref>\n\nThe competition consists of various athletic events, including men's and women's [[basketball]], women's [[volleyball]], and men's [[ultimate frisbee]]. During halftime at the men's basketball game, a cheer competition between the Purple Side and the Gold Side takes place. Both sides craft a sign which is displayed in front of Farmer Hall, the campus's [[student union building]]. The main event of College Night is the series of [[musical theater]] productions, all directed, performed, and produced by student participants. The productions last from Wednesday through Saturday on the week of College Night. It is after the final production on Saturday night when either a Purple Victory or a Gold Victory is declared until the next year's College Night. The victor of College Night is decided based on a system of points derived from each side's degree of sportsmanship, how well they perform in the various events, and how the judges of the student-led productions rate each side's show.\n\nIn honor of A.G.T.I.'s 25th anniversary in 1921, College Night became a competition between two sides, Purple and Gold, instead of a competition between the classes.<ref>Jefferson Walker, ''College Night: A Centennial Celebration'' (Montevallo, AL: University of Montevallo, 2019), 5.</ref> Since then, both sides have adopted mascots; Purple Side adopted the cow as theirs, and Gold Side adopted the lion as theirs. Each side has a song that is sung only when members of the side join hands, forming a circle; whereas Purple Side's circle is connected 360\u00b0 around, Gold Side leaves a small whole in their circle. When \"circled up,\" the leaders of each side \"ask a question\" to all the other members of their respective sides. Purple Side's leaders ask, \"Why is their ''never'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side always responds with, \"Because! A united circle is a united side! Let the circle be unbroken!\" Gold Side's leaders ask their side, \"Why is there ''always'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side responds by saying, \"Because! There's always room for one more Gold!\"\n\nIn 2000, College Night was declared a \"Local Legacy\" by the [[Library of Congress]], with an exhibit containing audio recordings of Purple and Gold side songs, photographs, College Night programs, and other artifacts.<ref>Ibid., 190.</ref>\n\n===Crook Week/Senior March===\n[[File:Main Hall, University of Montevallo.JPG|thumb|left|Main Hall, University of Montevallo]]\nTraditionally, Crook Week was a week in late October when the senior class women would hide the \"crook\"\u2014a staff shaped roughly like a [[shepherd]]'s [[crosier|crook]]\u2014and give obscure clues for the underclass women who were to find it.\n\nAt the end of Crook Week was Senior March. When the chimes struck thirteen, if the underclass women did not find the crook, the seniors march on them, getting them out of their rooms and onto Main Quad where they would have a shaving cream and water balloon battle. If the underclass women found the crook, they were safe that year. This tradition ended in the 1990s because the administration considered it hazing.\n\nToday, the Hiding of the Crook occurs the week of Founders' Day. The administration hides the crook and leaves clues as to where it can be found. The finder of the crook gets recognized at Founders' Day with a small prize.\n\n=== Life Raft Debate ===\nThe Life Raft Debate is an annual event sponsored by the Philosophy Club. The debate has occurred each fall semester since 1998, making it the longest continually-held debate of its type.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  The debate occurs on the second Thursday in October during the university's Founders' Day commemoration.\n\nIn the Life Raft Debate, the audience is asked to imagine that there has been a nuclear war and that they, as the survivors, are setting sail to rebuild society from the ground up. There are a group of professors vying to win the coveted Oar and get on the raft, and only one seat is left. Each professor has to argue that his or her discipline is the one indispensable area of study that the new civilization will need to flourish.\n[[File:Varagona with oar.jpg|thumb|Dr. Scott Varagona with the oar]]\n\nEach professor gets to give an introductory account of his or her discipline then a brief rebuttal to the others. At the end of the debate, the audience votes and the lucky winner claims the Oar and climbs aboard, waving goodbye to the others. Often, a seventh participant, the Devil's Advocate, appears and tries to convince the audience that the entire panel is unworthy and that all should be left behind to drown. In the following year, the defending champion faces five new challengers in a new debate. To date, no one has successfully defended the Oar.\n\nThe first event was held in 1998 before an audience of roughly 200 people. Michael Sterner of the Mathematics Department carried the day with an impassioned defense of his discipline, touting both its usefulness and beauty and promising that, if he were to be saved, there would be \"no more word problems ever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liferaftdebate.com/|title=University of Montevallo's Life Raft Debate Home Page|author=|date=|website=www.liferaftdebate.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> In the subsequent years the debate's popularity grew to attract more than 800 audience members per year. Following years saw victories by professors from a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, the public radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' ran a story on the Life Raft Debate entitled \"I'd Like to Spank the Academy.\"<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/402/save-the-day episode 402, ''Save the Day'']</ref> The story followed the events of the 2007 Life Raft Debate in which the Devil's Advocate, Professor Jon Smith of the Department of English, successfully argued that all the panelists should be drowned because they were merely trying to be funny, not to educate or to defend the importance of their respective disciplines. Following the broadcast, several colleges and universities in the United States and abroad began hosting Life Raft Debates of their own, most after consulting the UM Philosophy Club for advice.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Campus resources==\n===James Wylie Shepherd Observatory===\nThe James Wylie Shepherd Observatory at the University of Montevallo was opened in the Fall of 2009. The observatory was built on the site of a former construction landfill, now remade into Gentry Springs field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2011/05/26/voting-for-the-stars/ |title=Voting for the stars |last=Hurst |first=Katie |date=26 May 2011 |publisher=[[Shelby County Reporter]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> The observatory is a U of M sustainability landmark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2011/10/montevallo-introduces-a-new-bike-share-program/ |title=Montevallo introduces a new bike share program |date=19 October 2011 |publisher=MyGreenBirmingham.com |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory is located roughly three miles from the university campus.]]\n\nThe observatory is located roughly three miles from the main campus on the 150-acre Gentry Springs site owned by the university. The JWSO is capable of astronomical telescopic observation and astrophotography, has a dedicated telescope for solar viewing, and is one of very few observatories in the country that is designed specifically to be completely accessible to people of all disabilities.\n\nBesides its observing capabilities, the JWSO will be a [[Green building|green facility]], employing self-composting toilets, filtered rainwater and solar-generated electricity. The facility is currently used by UM classes, the Montevallo Astronomical Society, AMSTI partners and a variety of area K-12 classes and other local groups. There are also regularly-scheduled public viewing nights that are free of charge.\n\nUpon completion, the observing complex will house an outdoor planetarium/amphitheater, a docent's cabin, walking trails, a digital indoor planetarium, a visiting scholar's dormitory, educational exhibits and a visitors' center in which groups can see images generated by the main telescope.  Additional smaller scopes for solar and planetary observing can be set up at various locations outside the main dome, which is surrounded by solar-powered outdoor low-level lighting.\n\n===Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve===\n[[File:Ebenezer Swamp Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|The Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve is located in Shelby County, Alabama. It is maintained by The University of Montevallo for teaching and research.]]\n\nThe University of Montevallo's Ebenezer Swamp consists of approximately {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of wooded wetlands and is located on near the headwaters of Spring Creek, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the University in central Alabama.\n\nSpring Creek and Ebenezer Swamp form a portion of the headwaters for the ecologically diverse and environmentally sensitive [[Cahaba River]] Watershed. The Cahaba is the longest remaining free-flowing river, has more species of fish per mile than any river in North America and is one of eight river biodiversity hotspots in the U.S.\n\nUM is creating the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretive and Research Center (ESWIRC) to focus greater research on wetland ecology and to increase educational opportunities for high school and middle school students from across the state of Alabama.  Research goals center on: establishing and maintaining an inventory of plant, animal and fungal species; monitoring water quality, rainfall and stream flow rates; and future studies of wetland ecological processes and the effects of encroachment along the swamp margin.  Education goals center on raising the profile of the ecologic importance of wetlands to high school and middle school students, while simultaneously providing them with a sound introduction to the underlying principles of biology.\n\n===ValloCycle: Montevallo Bike-Share Program===\nFormed through a collaborative partnership between the City of [[Montevallo]] and the University of Montevallo, the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]] exists as a citywide initiative to enhance overall community walkability and individual citizen engagement with a lifestyle of sustainable, alternative transportation. The ValloCycle Bike-Share Program's primary means of achieving these goals is through its day-to-day operation of the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]], the first county-wide bicycle sharing program in the state of Alabama to offer low-cost bicycle rentals to all the members of its community.\n\nUnlike other nearby campus bike-share programs, ValloCycle bicycle rentals are not limited solely to university students and are also not confined to one location. Rather, bicycle rentals are offered to all residents of Montevallo and the surrounding Shelby County area in three separate check-out locations.

Founded in 1896, it is Alabama's only public [[liberal arts college]] and a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]]. The [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was established in 1979 and included 16 buildings on campus.

The university opened in October 1896 as the Alabama Girls' Industrial School (AGIS), a women-only [[technical school]] that also offered [[high school]]-level courses. AGIS became the Alabama Girls' Technical Institute in 1911, further adding \"and College for Women\" in 1919. The school gradually developed as a traditional degree-granting institution, becoming '''Alabama College''', State College for Women in 1923.\n\nThe school effectively became [[coeducation]]al after lobbying by the school's supporters resulted in the [[Alabama Legislature]] passing a bill on January 15, 1956 to remove the designation \"State College for Women\". The first men entered the school that same month. Its student body still maintains a 7:5 ratio of women to men.\n\nIn 1965, the board of trustees authorized President D.P. Culp to sign the Certificates of Assurance of Compliance with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=ency>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1827 Encyclopedia of Alabama: University of Montevallo], accessed 2010-05-16.</ref> In the fall of 1968, three African American women, Carolyn Burpo, Ruby Kennbrew and Dorothy (Lilly) Turner, enrolled in the university.<ref name=ency/> On September 1, 1969, Alabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo.\n\nThe [[Alabama Girls' Industrial School]] was listed on the National Register in 1978. In 1990, the [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was listed on the National Register, as an expansion.\n\nMontevallo is in the geographic center of [[Alabama]] in an area rich with [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history. Many of the buildings on campus predate the founding of the college, including King House (reserved for special guests of the campus) and Reynolds Hall (used by the Theater Department and alumni relations). King House was reportedly the first home in Alabama to receive pane glass windows. With nearly 3,000 students, the university has a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]].\n\n==Traditions==\n\n=== College Night ===\nThe University of Montevallo's [[homecoming]] tradition is called '''College Night''', a coeducational competition in which students may participate for either the Purple Side or the Gold Side, named after the school's colors. The tradition of College Night began as a celebration of the upcoming renaming of Alabama Girls' Technical Institute to Alabama College. First taking place on March 3, 1919, as a competition between the four classes, the Class of 1919 said that \"now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/technala121919unse/page/n31/mode/2up</ref>\n\nThe competition consists of various athletic events, including men's and women's [[basketball]], women's [[volleyball]], and men's [[ultimate frisbee]]. During halftime at the men's basketball game, a cheer competition between the Purple Side and the Gold Side takes place. Both sides craft a sign which is displayed in front of Farmer Hall, the campus's [[student union building]]. The main event of College Night is the series of [[musical theater]] productions, all directed, performed, and produced by student participants. The productions last from Wednesday through Saturday on the week of College Night. It is after the final production on Saturday night when either a Purple Victory or a Gold Victory is declared until the next year's College Night. The victor of College Night is decided based on a system of points derived from each side's degree of sportsmanship, how well they perform in the various events, and how the judges of the student-led productions rate each side's show.\n\nIn honor of A.G.T.I.'s 25th anniversary in 1921, College Night became a competition between two sides, Purple and Gold, instead of a competition between the classes.<ref>Jefferson Walker, ''College Night: A Centennial Celebration'' (Montevallo, AL: University of Montevallo, 2019), 5.</ref> Since then, both sides have adopted mascots; Purple Side adopted the cow as theirs, and Gold Side adopted the lion as theirs. Each side has a song that is sung only when members of the side join hands, forming a circle; whereas Purple Side's circle is connected 360\u00b0 around, Gold Side leaves a small whole in their circle. When \"circled up,\" the leaders of each side \"ask a question\" to all the other members of their respective sides. Purple Side's leaders ask, \"Why is their ''never'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side always responds with, \"Because! A united circle is a united side! Let the circle be unbroken!\" Gold Side's leaders ask their side, \"Why is there ''always'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side responds by saying, \"Because! There's always room for one more Gold!\"\n\nIn 2000, College Night was declared a \"Local Legacy\" by the [[Library of Congress]], with an exhibit containing audio recordings of Purple and Gold side songs, photographs, College Night programs, and other artifacts.<ref>Ibid., 190.</ref>\n\n===Crook Week/Senior March===\n[[File:Main Hall, University of Montevallo.JPG|thumb|left|Main Hall, University of Montevallo]]\nTraditionally, Crook Week was a week in late October when the senior class women would hide the \"crook\"\u2014a staff shaped roughly like a [[shepherd]]'s [[crosier|crook]]\u2014and give obscure clues for the underclass women who were to find it.\n\nAt the end of Crook Week was Senior March. When the chimes struck thirteen, if the underclass women did not find the crook, the seniors march on them, getting them out of their rooms and onto Main Quad where they would have a shaving cream and water balloon battle. If the underclass women found the crook, they were safe that year. This tradition ended in the 1990s because the administration considered it hazing.\n\nToday, the Hiding of the Crook occurs the week of Founders' Day. The administration hides the crook and leaves clues as to where it can be found. The finder of the crook gets recognized at Founders' Day with a small prize.\n\n=== Life Raft Debate ===\nThe Life Raft Debate is an annual event sponsored by the Philosophy Club. The debate has occurred each fall semester since 1998, making it the longest continually-held debate of its type.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  The debate occurs on the second Thursday in October during the university's Founders' Day commemoration.\n\nIn the Life Raft Debate, the audience is asked to imagine that there has been a nuclear war and that they, as the survivors, are setting sail to rebuild society from the ground up. There are a group of professors vying to win the coveted Oar and get on the raft, and only one seat is left. Each professor has to argue that his or her discipline is the one indispensable area of study that the new civilization will need to flourish.\n[[File:Varagona with oar.jpg|thumb|Dr. Scott Varagona with the oar]]\n\nEach professor gets to give an introductory account of his or her discipline then a brief rebuttal to the others. At the end of the debate, the audience votes and the lucky winner claims the Oar and climbs aboard, waving goodbye to the others. Often, a seventh participant, the Devil's Advocate, appears and tries to convince the audience that the entire panel is unworthy and that all should be left behind to drown. In the following year, the defending champion faces five new challengers in a new debate. To date, no one has successfully defended the Oar.\n\nThe first event was held in 1998 before an audience of roughly 200 people. Michael Sterner of the Mathematics Department carried the day with an impassioned defense of his discipline, touting both its usefulness and beauty and promising that, if he were to be saved, there would be \"no more word problems ever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liferaftdebate.com/|title=University of Montevallo's Life Raft Debate Home Page|author=|date=|website=www.liferaftdebate.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> In the subsequent years the debate's popularity grew to attract more than 800 audience members per year. Following years saw victories by professors from a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, the public radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' ran a story on the Life Raft Debate entitled \"I'd Like to Spank the Academy.\"<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/402/save-the-day episode 402, ''Save the Day'']</ref> The story followed the events of the 2007 Life Raft Debate in which the Devil's Advocate, Professor Jon Smith of the Department of English, successfully argued that all the panelists should be drowned because they were merely trying to be funny, not to educate or to defend the importance of their respective disciplines. Following the broadcast, several colleges and universities in the United States and abroad began hosting Life Raft Debates of their own, most after consulting the UM Philosophy Club for advice.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Campus resources==\n===James Wylie Shepherd Observatory===\nThe James Wylie Shepherd Observatory at the University of Montevallo was opened in the Fall of 2009. The observatory was built on the site of a former construction landfill, now remade into Gentry Springs field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2011/05/26/voting-for-the-stars/ |title=Voting for the stars |last=Hurst |first=Katie |date=26 May 2011 |publisher=[[Shelby County Reporter]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> The observatory is a U of M sustainability landmark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2011/10/montevallo-introduces-a-new-bike-share-program/ |title=Montevallo introduces a new bike share program |date=19 October 2011 |publisher=MyGreenBirmingham.com |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory is located roughly three miles from the university campus.]]\n\nThe observatory is located roughly three miles from the main campus on the 150-acre Gentry Springs site owned by the university. The JWSO is capable of astronomical telescopic observation and astrophotography, has a dedicated telescope for solar viewing, and is one of very few observatories in the country that is designed specifically to be completely accessible to people of all disabilities.\n\nBesides its observing capabilities, the JWSO will be a [[Green building|green facility]], employing self-composting toilets, filtered rainwater and solar-generated electricity. The facility is currently used by UM classes, the Montevallo Astronomical Society, AMSTI partners and a variety of area K-12 classes and other local groups. There are also regularly-scheduled public viewing nights that are free of charge.\n\nUpon completion, the observing complex will house an outdoor planetarium/amphitheater, a docent's cabin, walking trails, a digital indoor planetarium, a visiting scholar's dormitory, educational exhibits and a visitors' center in which groups can see images generated by the main telescope.  Additional smaller scopes for solar and planetary observing can be set up at various locations outside the main dome, which is surrounded by solar-powered outdoor low-level lighting.\n\n===Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve===\n[[File:Ebenezer Swamp Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|The Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve is located in Shelby County, Alabama. It is maintained by The University of Montevallo for teaching and research.]]\n\nThe University of Montevallo's Ebenezer Swamp consists of approximately {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of wooded wetlands and is located on near the headwaters of Spring Creek, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the University in central Alabama.\n\nSpring Creek and Ebenezer Swamp form a portion of the headwaters for the ecologically diverse and environmentally sensitive [[Cahaba River]] Watershed. The Cahaba is the longest remaining free-flowing river, has more species of fish per mile than any river in North America and is one of eight river biodiversity hotspots in the U.S.\n\nUM is creating the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretive and Research Center (ESWIRC) to focus greater research on wetland ecology and to increase educational opportunities for high school and middle school students from across the state of Alabama.  Research goals center on: establishing and maintaining an inventory of plant, animal and fungal species; monitoring water quality, rainfall and stream flow rates; and future studies of wetland ecological processes and the effects of encroachment along the swamp margin.  Education goals center on raising the profile of the ecologic importance of wetlands to high school and middle school students, while simultaneously providing them with a sound introduction to the underlying principles of biology.\n\n===ValloCycle: Montevallo Bike-Share Program===\nFormed through a collaborative partnership between the City of [[Montevallo]] and the University of Montevallo, the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]] exists as a citywide initiative to enhance overall community walkability and individual citizen engagement with a lifestyle of sustainable, alternative transportation. The ValloCycle Bike-Share Program's primary means of achieving these goals is through its day-to-day operation of the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]], the first county-wide bicycle sharing program in the state of Alabama to offer low-cost bicycle rentals to all the members of its community.\n\nUnlike other nearby campus bike-share programs, ValloCycle bicycle rentals are not limited solely to university students and are also not confined to one location. Rather, bicycle rentals are offered to all residents of Montevallo and the surrounding Shelby County area in three separate check-out locations. Annual membership fees amount to roughly $2 a month for adults and $1 a month per child.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57349669/green-group-tornado-cleanup-a-bright-spot-for-ala/|title=Green Group Tornado Cleanup A Bright Spot For Alabama |date=29 December 2011 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2012/01/birmingham_bike-share_program.html|title=Birmingham Bike Share Program Pedals Into Downtown Life |last=Spencer |first=Tom |date= 2 January 2012 |newspaper=[[Birmingham News]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe all-volunteer ValloCycle Board oversees the implementation of a number of other campus and community programs, events, resources and public bicyclist/pedestrian infrastructure enhancements, including the Montevallo \"Share the Lane\" Initiative,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weldbham.com/local/2011/12/16/sharing-the-lanes-new-biking-infrastructure-in-montevallo/ |title=Sharing the lanes: New biking infrastructure in Montevallo |last=Chambers |first= Jesse |date= 16 December 2011 |publisher=[[WELD For Birmingham]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> the ValloCycle Town Map Project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2012/02/vallocycle-creates-town-map-showcases-local-businesses-sustainablity/ |title=Vallocycle Creates Town Map, Showcases Local Businesses & Sustainability |last=Agliata |first=Kate |date=1 February 2012 |publisher=My Green Birmingham |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> and the Montevallo \"Tour By Bike\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southshelby.myfoxal.com/news/environment/97695-um-celebrates-sustainability-115th-founders-day |title=UM celebrates sustainability at 115th Founder's Day |last=Sides |first=Melinda |date=13 October 2011 |publisher=Fox 6 WBRC |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Membership forms are available at ValloCycle's public website, vallocycle.com.\n\n===Greek life===\n\n====Interfraternity Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]] (Gamma Delta, 1995)\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]] (Eta Omega, 1972)\n* [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] (Sigma-Epsilon, 1972)\n* [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (Mu Phi, 2014)\n\n====Panhellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]] (Zeta Delta, 1971)\n* [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] (Gamma Upsilon, 1972)\n* [[Chi Omega]] (Tau Kappa, 1971)\n* [[Delta Gamma]] (Zeta Nu, 1991)\n* [[Phi Mu]] (Kappa Chi, 1972)\n\n====National Pan-Hellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Mu Mu, 1978)\n* [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] (Nu Tau, 1978)\n* [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Nu Omicron, 1977)\n* [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] (Xi Upsilon, 1995)\n* [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (Tau Pi, 1998)\n\n====Professional fraternity====\n* [[Phi Chi Theta]] (Gamma Tau, 1973)\n\n===Disc golf course===\nIn 2007, The University of Montevallo in cooperation with the Professional Disc Golf Association built a full size, 18 hole, disc golf course on the grounds of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdga.com/course_directory/course/university-of-montevallo|title=University of Montevallo|first=PDGA|last=Staff|date=2 September 2009|website=pdga.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> At the time of its construction it was one of the few courses located on the campus of a public university in the region.

He was also an influential [[redology]] scholar and held the famous Jiaxu manuscript for many years until his death.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Hu Shi.jpg|thumb|Hu Shih as pictured in ''[[The Most Recent Biographies of Important Chinese People]]''|180px]]\n[[File:Hu Shih and Chiang Kai-shek at Academia Sinica 19580410.jpg|thumbnail|Hu Shih (left) and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in April 1958]]\nHu was born in [[Shanghai]], China to Hu Chuan ({{zh|t=\u80e1\u50b3|p=H\u00fa Chu\u00e1n|labels=no}}) and Feng Shundi ({{zh|t=\u99ae\u9806\u5f1f|p=F\u00e9ng Sh\u00f9nd\u00ec|labels=no}}), with ancestry from [[Jixi County]] in [[Anhui province]]. Family legend has it that Hu Shih's ancestors were descended from the last teenage Emperor of Tang China (being different in origin from the rest of the Hu clan), who fled in disguise with a loyal minister of court in 907 to Anhui and eventually took the name as his son. In January 1904, his family arranged his marriage to Chiang Tung-hsiu ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u51ac\u79c0|p=Ji\u0101ng D\u014dngxi\u00f9|labels=no}}), an illiterate girl with [[bound feet]] who was one year older than he was. The marriage took place in December 1917. Hu received his fundamental education in Jixi and [[Shanghai]].\n\nHu became a \"national scholar\" through funds appropriated from the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. On 16 August 1910, he was sent to study agriculture at [[Cornell University]] in the U.S. In 1912 he changed his major to philosophy and literature. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he went to study philosophy at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], where he was greatly influenced by his professor, [[John Dewey]]. Hu became Dewey's translator and a lifelong advocate of [[pragmatism|pragmatic evolutionary change]], helping Dewey in his 1919\u20131921 lectures series in China. He returned to lecture in [[Peking University]]. During his tenure there, he received support from [[Chen Duxiu]], editor of the influential journal ''[[New Youth]]'', quickly gaining much attention and influence. Hu soon became one of the leading and influential intellectuals during the [[May Fourth Movement]] and later the [[New Culture Movement]].\n\nHe quit ''[[New Youth]]'' in the 1920s and published several political newspapers and journals with his friends. His most important contribution was the promotion of [[vernacular Chinese]] in literature to replace [[Classical Chinese]], which was intended to make it easier for the ordinary person to read.<ref name=\"Luo\">Luo, Jing (2004).

In 1957, he became the third president of the [[Academia Sinica]] in Taipei, a post he retained until his death. He was also chief executive of the ''[[Free China Journal]]'', which was eventually shut down for criticizing [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nHe died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Nangang District, Taipei|Nankang, Taipei]] at the age of 70, and was entombed in Hu Shih Park, adjacent to the Academia Sinica campus.

Today, the word Pragmatism is more commonly translated as [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: \u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: \u5be6\u7528\u4e3b\u7fa9; [[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00edy\u00f2ngzh\u01d4y\u00ec''.|date=November 2019|reason=A specific source showing that he coined the word (when and how) is needed.}}\n\nHu Shih's adoption of Pragmatism is, in fact, a reflection of his own philosophical appeals. Before he encountered Dewey's works, he wrote in his diary that he was in a search of \"practical philosophy,\" instead of deep and obscure philosophies for the survival of the Chinese people. Instead of abstract theories, he was more interested in methodologies (''\u672f, sh\u00f9'').<ref>Hu, Shi (1959). ''\u80e1\u9002\u7559\u5b66\u65e5\u8bb0''. Taipei: Commercial Press. pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> Hu viewed Pragmatism as a scientific methodology for the study of philosophy. He greatly appreciated the universality of such a scientific approach because he believed that such a methodology transcends the boundary of culture and therefore can be applied anywhere, including China during his time. Hu Shih was not so interested in the content of Dewey's philosophy, caring rather about the method, the attitude, and the scientific spirit.<ref>Hu Shih, ''\u675c\u5a01\u5148\u751f\u4e0e\u4e2d\u56fd (Mr. Dewey and China)'', dated July 11, 1921; \u80e1\u9002\u6587\u5b58 (Collected Essays of Hu Shih), ii, 533-537.</ref>\n\nHu Shih saw all ideologies and abstract theories only as hypotheses waiting to be tested. The content of ideologies, Hu believed, was shaped by the background, political environment, and even the personality of the theorist. Thus these theories were confined within their temporality.  Hu felt that only the attitude and spirit of an ideology could be universally applied. Therefore, Hu criticized any dogmatic application of ideologies. After Hu took over as the chief editor at Weekly Commentary (\u6bcf\u5468\u8bc4\u8bba) in 1919, he and [[Li Dazhao]] engaged in a heated debate regarding ideology and problem (\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bba\u6218) that was influential among Chinese intellectuals at that time. Hu writes in \"A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms\" (\u4e09\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49):<blockquote>\"Every isms and every theory should be studied, but they can only be viewed as hypothesis, not dogmatic credo; they can only be viewed as a source of reference, not as rules of religion; they can only be viewed as inspiring tools, not as absolute truth that halts any further critical thinkings. Only in this way can people cultivate creative intelligence, become able to solve specific problems, and emancipate from the superstition of abstract words.\"<ref>Hu Shih, \u4e09\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49 (A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms), ''\u6bcf\u5468\u8bc4\u8bba no. 36'', (Aug. 24, 1919); \u80e1\u9002\u6587\u5b58 (Collected Essays of Hu Shih), ii, 373.</ref></blockquote>Throughout the literary works and other scholarships of Hu Shih, the presence of Pragmatism as a method is prevalent. In fact, Hu saw his life work as a consistent project of practicing the scientific spirit of Pragmatism since science is an attitude, a lifestyle that must be lived.\n\n=== Skepticism ===\nFor Hu Shih, Skepticism and Pragmatism are inseparable. In his essay \"Introducing My Thoughts\" (\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u601d\u60f3), he states that [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas H. Huxley]] is the one person, other than Dewey, who most heavily influenced his thoughts.<ref>Hu, Shih (1935). ''\u80e1\u9002\u8bba\u5b66\u8fd1\u8457 (Hu Shih's Recent Writings on Scholarship)''. Shanghai: Commercial Press. pp. 630\u2013646.</ref> Huxley's [[Agnosticism]] is the negative precondition to the practical, active problem-solving of Dewey's Pragmatism. Huxley's \"[[genetic method]]\" in Hu's writing becomes a \"historical attitude,\" an attitude that ensures one's intellectual independence which also leads to individual emancipation and political freedom.\n\n=== Chinese Intellectual History ===\nHu Shih brought the scientific method and the spirit of Skepticism into traditional Chinese textual study ([[Kaozheng]]), laying the groundwork for contemporary studies of [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectual history]].\n\nIn 1919, Hu Shih published the first volume of ''An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy''; the later portion was never finished. Later scholars of Chinese intellectual history including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Yu Ying-shih|Yu Yingshi]] agree that Hu's work was revolutionary. [[Cai Yuanpei]], president of Peking University where Hu was teaching at the time, wrote the preface for ''Outline'' and pointed out four key features that make Hu's work distinct:\n\n# Method of proving for dates, validity, and perspectives of methodology\n# \"Cutting off the many schools\" (\u622a\u65ad\u4f17\u6d41), meaning that remove{{clarify|reason=Grammar-related problems here|date=May 2019}} all schools before the time of [[Warring States period|the Warring States]] and starting with [[Laozi]] and Confucius\n# Equal treatment for Confucianism, [[Mohism]], Mencius, and Xunzi\n# Systematic studies with chronological orders and juxtaposition that present the evolution of theories\n\nWithout a doubt, Hu's organisation of classical Chinese philosophy imitated Western philosophical history, but the influence of textual study since the time of the Qing dynasty is still present. Especially for the second point, \"cutting off the many schools\" is a result of the continuous effort of Qing scholarship around ancient textual studies. Since the validity of the ancient texts is questionable and the content of them obscure, Hu decided to leave them out. In fact, before the publication of ''Outline'', Hu was appointed to be the lecturer of History of Classical Chinese Philosophy. His decision of leaving out pre-Warring States philosophy almost caused a riot among students.<ref>Yu, Ying-shih (2014). ''Collected Writings of Yu Ying-shih''. Guilin: Guangxi Normal University Press. p. 348-355.</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph is unclear|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn ''Outline'', other philosophical schools of the Warring States were first treated as equal. Hu did not hold Confucianism as the paradigm while treating other schools as heresy. Rather, Hu saw philosophical values within other schools, even those considered to be anti-Confucian, like Mohism. In 1919, this was considered a significant revolutionary act among intellectuals. Yu Yingshi, a prominent Taiwanese historian on intellectual history even praised Hu for setting up a new paradigm according to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s Enlightenment theory.<ref>Yu, Ying-shih (2014). ''Collected Writings of Yu Ying-shih''. Guilin: Guangxi Normal University Press. p. 357.</ref>\n\nDespite recognising the revolutionary nature of Hu's work. Feng Youlan, the author of ''A History of Chinese Philosophy'', criticises Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework in ''Outline''. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu criticises these schools from a pragmatist perspective which makes the reader feel as if \"the whole Chinese civilisation is entirely on the wrong track.\"<ref>Yu-lan Fung, \"Philosophy in Contemporary China\" paper presented in the Eighth International Philosophy Conference, Prague, 1934.</ref> Feng also disagrees with Hu's extensive effort on researching the validity of the resource text. Feng believes that as long as the work itself is philosophically valuable, its validity is not as significant.<ref>Chou, Chih-p'ing (2012).

Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 290.</ref>\n\nHu sees individual contributions as crucial and beneficial to the system of democracy. In \"A Second Discussion on Nation-Building and Autocracy\" (\u518d\u8c08\u5efa\u56fd\u4e0e\u4e13\u6cbb), Hu comments that an autocratic system needs professionals to manage it while democracy relies on the wisdom of the people. When different people's lived experiences come together, no elite politician is needed for coordination, and therefore democracy is, in fact, easy to practice with people who lack political experience. He calls democracy \"naive politics\" (\u5e7c\u7a1a\u653f\u6cbb), a political system that can help cultivate those who participate in it.<ref>\"[https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%BE%9E%E4%B8%80%E9%BB%A8%E5%88%B0%E7%84%A1%E9%BB%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB \u4ece\u4e00\u515a\u5230\u65e0\u515a\u7684\u653f\u6cbb - \u7ef4\u57fa\u6587\u5e93\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986]\".

In a democratic system, people should be free from any political persecution as well as any public pressure. In his 1959 essay \"Tolerance and Freedom,\" Hu Shih stressed the importance of tolerance and claimed that \"tolerance is the basis of freedom.\" In a democratic society, the existence of opposition must be tolerated. Minority rights are respected and protected. People must not destroy or silence the opposition.<ref>Zhou, Zhiping (2012). ''\u5149\u7130\u4e0d\u7184\uff1a\u80e1\u9002\u601d\u60f3\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd''. Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 290-292.</ref>\n\n==== The Chinese Root of Democracy ====\nA large portion of Hu Shih's scholarship in his later years is dedicated to finding a Chinese root for democracy and liberalism. Many of his writings, including Historic \"Tradition for a Democratic China,\"{{clarify|reason=Is the word \"Historic\" part of the title?  If not, it's unclear what it's doing here.|date=May 2019}} \"The Right to Doubt in Ancient Chinese Thought,\" \"Authority and Freedom in the Ancient Asian World\" make a similar claim that the democratic spirit is always present within the Chinese tradition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Writings of Hu Shih|last=Shih|first=Hu|date=2013|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642311802|editor-last=Chou|editor-first=Chih-P'ing|series=China Academic Library|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31181-9}}</ref> Some of his claims{{clarify|reason=There's probably a better word than \"claims\" here|date=May 2019}} include:\n\n# A thoroughly democratized social structure by an equal inheritance system among sons and the right to rebel under oppressive regimes.\n# Widespread accessibility of political participation through civil service exams.\n# Intragovernmental criticism and censorial control formalized by governmental institutions and the Confucian tradition of political criticism.\n\n=== Constitutionalism and Human Rights Movement ===\nIn 1928, Hu along with [[Xu Zhimo]], [[Wen Yiduo]], [[Chen Yuan (historian)|Chen Yuan]] and [[Liang Shih-chiu|Liang Shiqiu]] founded the monthly journal ''Crescent Moon'', named after Tagore's prose verse. In March 1929, Shanghai Special Representatives of National Party Chen De proposed to punish any \"anti-revolutionary\" without due process. Hu Shih responded fiercely with an article in ''Crescent Moon'' titled \"Human Rights and Law\" (\u4eba\u6743\u4e0e\u7ea6\u6cd5). In the article, Hu called for the establishment of a written constitution that protects the rights of citizens, especially from the ruling government. The government must be held accountable to the constitution. Later in \"When Can We Have Constitution\u2013A Question for ''The Outline of National Reconstruction''\" (\u6211\u4eec\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u624d\u53ef\u6709\u5baa\u6cd5? \u2014\u2014 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u300a\u5efa\u56fd\u5927\u7eb2\u300b\u7684\u7591\u95ee), Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in ''The Outline of National Reconstruction''. Rejecting [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s claim that people are incapable of self-rule, Hu considered democracy itself a form of political education. The legitimacy and the competency of people participating in the political process comes from their lived experience.\n\n=== Criticism of the Chinese Communist Party after 1949 ===\nIn the early 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party launched a years-long campaign criticizing Hu Shih's thoughts. In response, Hu published many essays in English attacking the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>Zhou, Zhiping (2012). ''\u5149\u7130\u4e0d\u7184\uff1a\u80e1\u9002\u601d\u60f3\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd''. Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 202.</ref>\n\nHu's opposition to the Chinese Communist Party was essentially an ideological conflict. As a supporter of Pragmatism, Hu believed that social changes can only happen incrementally. Revolution or any ideologies that claim to solve social problems once and for all are not possible. Such a perspective was present in his early writing, as in the ''problem'' versus ''isms'' debate. He often quotes from John Dewey: \"progress is not a wholesale matter, but a retail job, to be contracted for and executed in section.\" Another ideological conflict is with his individualism.{{clarify|date=May 2019}} Hu affirms the right of the individual as independent from the collective. The individual has the right to develop freely and diversely without political suppression in the name of uniformity. He writes in \"The Conflict of Ideologies\":<blockquote>\"The desire for uniformity leads to suppression of individual initiative, to the dwarfing of personality and creative effort, to intolerance, oppression, and slavery, and, worst of all, to intellectual dishonesty and moral hypocrisy.\"<ref>Hu, Shih (November 1941). \"The Conflicts of Ideologies,\" in ''The Annuals of American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 28, p. 32-34.</ref></blockquote>In contrast to a Marxist conception of history, Hu's conception of history is pluralistic and particular. In his talk with American economist Charles A. Beard, recorded in his diary, Hu believed the making of history is only coincidental. Therefore, as a proponent of reformism, pluralism, individualism, and skepticism, Hu's philosophy is irreconcilable with Communist ideologies. Hu's later scholarship around the Chinese root of liberalism and democracy is very consistent with his anti-CCP writings. In a later manuscript titled \"Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern,\" Hu constructs three arguments from Chinese intellectual history, especially from Confucian and Daoist tradition, to combat the authoritative rule of the Chinese Communist Party:<blockquote>1. An almost anarchistic aversion of all governmental interference.</blockquote><blockquote>2. A long tradition of love for freedom and fight for freedom\u2013especially for intellectual freedom and religious freedom, but also for the freedom of political criticism.</blockquote><blockquote>3. A traditional exaltation of the individual's right to doubt and question things\u2013even the most sacred things.<ref>Hu Shih, \"Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern.\"</ref></blockquote>Therefore, Hu regards the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party as not only \"unhistorical,\" but also \"un-Chinese.\"\n\n==Writings==\n\nHu was well known as the primary advocate for the literary revolution of the era, a movement which aimed to replace scholarly classical Chinese in writing with the vernacular spoken language, and to cultivate and stimulate new forms of literature. In an article originally published in ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' in January [[1917 in poetry|1917]] titled \"A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform\", Hu originally emphasized eight guidelines that all Chinese writers should take to heart in writing:\n\n#Write with substance. By this, Hu meant that literature should contain real feeling and human thought. This was intended to be a contrast to the recent poetry with rhymes and phrases that Hu saw as being empty.\n#Do not imitate the ancients. Literature should not be written in the styles of long ago, but rather in the modern style of the present era.\n#Respect grammar. Hu did not elaborate at length on this point, merely stating that some recent forms of poetry had neglected proper grammar.\n#Reject melancholy. Recent young authors often chose grave pen names, and wrote on such topics as death. Hu rejected this way of thinking as being unproductive in solving modern problems.\n#Eliminate old clich\u00e9s. The Chinese language has always had numerous [[Chengyu|four-character sayings and phrases]] used to describe events. Hu implored writers to use their own words in descriptions, and deplored those who did not.\n#Do not use allusions. By this, Hu was referring to the practice of comparing present events with historical events even when there is no meaningful analogy.\n#Do not use couplets or parallelism. Though these forms had been pursued by earlier writers, Hu believed that modern writers first needed to learn the basics of substance and quality, before returning to these matters of subtlety and delicacy.\n#Do not avoid popular expressions or popular forms of characters. This rule, perhaps the most well-known, ties in directly with Hu's belief that modern literature should be written in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. He believed that this practice had historical precedents, and led to greater understanding of important texts.\n\nIn April of [[1918 in poetry|1918]], Hu published a second article in ''New Youth'', this one titled \"Constructive Literary Revolution \u2013 A Literature of National Speech\". In it, he simplified the original eight points into just four:\n\n#Speak only when you have something to say. This is analogous to the first point above.\n#Speak what you want to say and say it in the way you want to say it. This combines points two through six above.\n#Speak what is your own and not that of someone else. This is a rewording of point seven.\n#Speak in the language of the time in which you live.

Hu is widely recognized today as a key contributor to [[liberalism in China|Chinese liberalism]] and [[language reform]] in his advocacy for the use of [[written vernacular Chinese]].

He was also an influential [[redology]] scholar and held the famous Jiaxu manuscript ({{zh|c=\u7532\u620c\u672c|p=Ji\u01cex\u016b b\u011bn|labels=no}}) for many years until his death.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Hu Shi.jpg|thumb|Hu Shih as pictured in ''[[The Most Recent Biographies of Important Chinese People]]''|180px]]\n[[File:Hu Shih and Chiang Kai-shek at Academia Sinica 19580410.jpg|thumbnail|Hu Shih (left) and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in April 1958]]\nHu was born in [[Shanghai]], China to Hu Chuan ({{zh|t=\u80e1\u50b3|p=H\u00fa Chu\u00e1n|labels=no}}) and Feng Shundi ({{zh|t=\u99ae\u9806\u5f1f|p=F\u00e9ng Sh\u00f9nd\u00ec|labels=no}}), with ancestry from [[Jixi County]] in [[Anhui province]]. Family legend has it that Hu Shih's ancestors were descended from the last teenage Emperor of Tang China (being different in origin from the rest of the Hu clan), who fled in disguise with a loyal minister of court in 907 to Anhui and eventually took the name as his son. In January 1904, his family arranged his marriage to Chiang Tung-hsiu ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u51ac\u79c0|p=Ji\u0101ng D\u014dngxi\u00f9|labels=no}}), an illiterate girl with [[bound feet]] who was one year older than he was. The marriage took place in December 1917. Hu received his fundamental education in Jixi and [[Shanghai]].\n\nHu became a \"national scholar\" through funds appropriated from the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. On 16 August 1910, he was sent to study agriculture at [[Cornell University]] in the U.S. In 1912 he changed his major to philosophy and literature. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he went to study philosophy at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], where he was greatly influenced by his professor, [[John Dewey]]. Hu became Dewey's translator and a lifelong advocate of [[pragmatism|pragmatic evolutionary change]], helping Dewey in his 1919\u20131921 lectures series in China. He returned to lecture in [[Peking University]]. During his tenure there, he received support from [[Chen Duxiu]], editor of the influential journal ''[[New Youth]]'', quickly gaining much attention and influence. Hu soon became one of the leading and influential intellectuals during the [[May Fourth Movement]] and later the [[New Culture Movement]].\n\nHe quit ''[[New Youth]]'' in the 1920s and published several political newspapers and journals with his friends. His most important contribution was the promotion of [[vernacular Chinese]] in literature to replace [[Classical Chinese]], which was intended to make it easier for the ordinary person to read.<ref name=\"Luo\">Luo, Jing (2004).

Beijing. pp. 362\u2013363. {{ISBN|7-100-03996-7}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophical Contributions ==\n\n=== Pragmatism ===\nDuring his time at Columbia, Hu studied with [[John Dewey]] and became a staunch supporter of the [[Pragmatism]] school. {{citation needed span|After returning to China, Hu first coined the word in [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: \u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e3b\u4e49; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: \u5be6\u9a57\u4e3b\u7fa9; [[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00edy\u00e0nzh\u01d4y\u00ec'', experimentalism in literal translation. Today, the word Pragmatism is more commonly translated as [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: \u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: \u5be6\u7528\u4e3b\u7fa9; [[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00edy\u00f2ngzh\u01d4y\u00ec''.|date=November 2019|reason=A specific source showing that he coined the word (when and how) is needed.}}\n\nHu Shih's adoption of Pragmatism is, in fact, a reflection of his own philosophical appeals. Before he encountered Dewey's works, he wrote in his diary that he was in a search of \"practical philosophy,\" instead of deep and obscure philosophies for the survival of the Chinese people. Instead of abstract theories, he was more interested in methodologies (''\u672f, sh\u00f9'').<ref>Hu, Shi (1959). ''\u80e1\u9002\u7559\u5b66\u65e5\u8bb0''. Taipei: Commercial Press. pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> Hu viewed Pragmatism as a scientific methodology for the study of philosophy. He greatly appreciated the universality of such a scientific approach because he believed that such a methodology transcends the boundary of culture and therefore can be applied anywhere, including China during his time. Hu Shih was not so interested in the content of Dewey's philosophy, caring rather about the method, the attitude, and the scientific spirit.<ref>Hu Shih, ''\u675c\u5a01\u5148\u751f\u4e0e\u4e2d\u56fd (Mr. Dewey and China)'', dated July 11, 1921; \u80e1\u9002\u6587\u5b58 (Collected Essays of Hu Shih), ii, 533-537.</ref>\n\nHu Shih saw all ideologies and abstract theories only as hypotheses waiting to be tested. The content of ideologies, Hu believed, was shaped by the background, political environment, and even the personality of the theorist. Thus these theories were confined within their temporality.  Hu felt that only the attitude and spirit of an ideology could be universally applied. Therefore, Hu criticized any dogmatic application of ideologies. After Hu took over as the chief editor at Weekly Commentary (\u6bcf\u5468\u8bc4\u8bba) in 1919, he and [[Li Dazhao]] engaged in a heated debate regarding ideology and problem (\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bba\u6218) that was influential among Chinese intellectuals at that time. Hu writes in \"A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms\" (\u4e09\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49):<blockquote>\"Every isms and every theory should be studied, but they can only be viewed as hypothesis, not dogmatic credo; they can only be viewed as a source of reference, not as rules of religion; they can only be viewed as inspiring tools, not as absolute truth that halts any further critical thinkings. Only in this way can people cultivate creative intelligence, become able to solve specific problems, and emancipate from the superstition of abstract words.\"<ref>Hu Shih, \u4e09\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4e49 (A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms), ''\u6bcf\u5468\u8bc4\u8bba no. 36'', (Aug. 24, 1919); \u80e1\u9002\u6587\u5b58 (Collected Essays of Hu Shih), ii, 373.</ref></blockquote>Throughout the literary works and other scholarships of Hu Shih, the presence of Pragmatism as a method is prevalent. In fact, Hu saw his life work as a consistent project of practicing the scientific spirit of Pragmatism since science is an attitude, a lifestyle that must be lived.\n\n=== Skepticism ===\nFor Hu Shih, Skepticism and Pragmatism are inseparable. In his essay \"Introducing My Thoughts\" (\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u601d\u60f3), he states that [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas H. Huxley]] is the one person, other than Dewey, who most heavily influenced his thoughts.<ref>Hu, Shih (1935). ''\u80e1\u9002\u8bba\u5b66\u8fd1\u8457 (Hu Shih's Recent Writings on Scholarship)''. Shanghai: Commercial Press. pp. 630\u2013646.</ref> Huxley's [[Agnosticism]] is the negative precondition to the practical, active problem-solving of Dewey's Pragmatism. Huxley's \"[[genetic method]]\" in Hu's writing becomes a \"historical attitude,\" an attitude that ensures one's intellectual independence which also leads to individual emancipation and political freedom.\n\n=== Chinese Intellectual History ===\nHu Shih brought the scientific method and the spirit of Skepticism into traditional Chinese textual study ([[Kaozheng]]), laying the groundwork for contemporary studies of [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectual history]].\n\nIn 1919, Hu Shih published the first volume of ''An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy''; the later portion was never finished. Later scholars of Chinese intellectual history including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Yu Ying-shih|Yu Yingshi]] agree that Hu's work was revolutionary. [[Cai Yuanpei]], president of Peking University where Hu was teaching at the time, wrote the preface for ''Outline'' and pointed out four key features that make Hu's work distinct:\n\n# Method of proving for dates, validity, and perspectives of methodology\n# \"Cutting off the many schools\" (\u622a\u65ad\u4f17\u6d41), meaning that remove{{clarify|reason=Grammar-related problems here|date=May 2019}} all schools before the time of [[Warring States period|the Warring States]] and starting with [[Laozi]] and Confucius\n# Equal treatment for Confucianism, [[Mohism]], Mencius, and Xunzi\n# Systematic studies with chronological orders and juxtaposition that present the evolution of theories\n\nWithout a doubt, Hu's organisation of classical Chinese philosophy imitated Western philosophical history, but the influence of textual study since the time of the Qing dynasty is still present. Especially for the second point, \"cutting off the many schools\" is a result of the continuous effort of Qing scholarship around ancient textual studies. Since the validity of the ancient texts is questionable and the content of them obscure, Hu decided to leave them out. In fact, before the publication of ''Outline'', Hu was appointed to be the lecturer of History of Classical Chinese Philosophy. His decision of leaving out pre-Warring States philosophy almost caused a riot among students.<ref>Yu, Ying-shih (2014). ''Collected Writings of Yu Ying-shih''. Guilin: Guangxi Normal University Press. p. 348-355.</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph is unclear|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn ''Outline'', other philosophical schools of the Warring States were first treated as equal. Hu did not hold Confucianism as the paradigm while treating other schools as heresy. Rather, Hu saw philosophical values within other schools, even those considered to be anti-Confucian, like Mohism. In 1919, this was considered a significant revolutionary act among intellectuals. Yu Yingshi, a prominent Taiwanese historian on intellectual history even praised Hu for setting up a new paradigm according to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s Enlightenment theory.<ref>Yu, Ying-shih (2014). ''Collected Writings of Yu Ying-shih''. Guilin: Guangxi Normal University Press. p. 357.</ref>\n\nDespite recognising the revolutionary nature of Hu's work. Feng Youlan, the author of ''A History of Chinese Philosophy'', criticises Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework in ''Outline''. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu criticises these schools from a pragmatist perspective which makes the reader feel as if \"the whole Chinese civilisation is entirely on the wrong track.\"<ref>Yu-lan Fung, \"Philosophy in Contemporary China\" paper presented in the Eighth International Philosophy Conference, Prague, 1934.</ref> Feng also disagrees with Hu's extensive effort on researching the validity of the resource text. Feng believes that as long as the work itself is philosophically valuable, its validity is not as significant.<ref>Chou, Chih-p'ing (2012).

Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 36.</ref>\n\n== Political views ==\n\n=== Individualism, Liberalism, and Democracy ===\nUnlike many of his contemporaries who later joined the Socialist camp, liberalism and democracy had been Hu's political beliefs throughout his life. He firmly believed that the world as a whole was heading toward democracy, despite the changing political landscape.<ref>Chou, Chih-p'ing (2012).

Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 290.</ref>\n\nHu sees individual contributions as crucial and beneficial to the system of democracy. In \"A Second Discussion on Nation-Building and Autocracy\" (\u518d\u8c08\u5efa\u56fd\u4e0e\u4e13\u6cbb), Hu comments that an autocratic system needs professionals to manage it while democracy relies on the wisdom of the people. When different people's lived experiences come together, no elite politician is needed for coordination, and therefore democracy is, in fact, easy to practice with people who lack political experience. He calls democracy \"naive politics\" (\u5e7c\u7a1a\u653f\u6cbb), a political system that can help cultivate those who participate in it.<ref>\"[https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%BE%9E%E4%B8%80%E9%BB%A8%E5%88%B0%E7%84%A1%E9%BB%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB \u4ece\u4e00\u515a\u5230\u65e0\u515a\u7684\u653f\u6cbb - \u7ef4\u57fa\u6587\u5e93\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986]\".

In a democratic system, people should be free from any political persecution as well as any public pressure. In his 1959 essay \"Tolerance and Freedom,\" Hu Shih stressed the importance of tolerance and claimed that \"tolerance is the basis of freedom.\" In a democratic society, the existence of opposition must be tolerated. Minority rights are respected and protected. People must not destroy or silence the opposition.<ref>Zhou, Zhiping (2012). ''\u5149\u7130\u4e0d\u7184\uff1a\u80e1\u9002\u601d\u60f3\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd''. Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 290-292.</ref>\n\n==== The Chinese Root of Democracy ====\nA large portion of Hu Shih's scholarship in his later years is dedicated to finding a Chinese root for democracy and liberalism. Many of his writings, including Historic \"Tradition for a Democratic China,\"{{clarify|reason=Is the word \"Historic\" part of the title?  If not, it's unclear what it's doing here.|date=May 2019}} \"The Right to Doubt in Ancient Chinese Thought,\" \"Authority and Freedom in the Ancient Asian World\" make a similar claim that the democratic spirit is always present within the Chinese tradition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Writings of Hu Shih|last=Shih|first=Hu|date=2013|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642311802|editor-last=Chou|editor-first=Chih-P'ing|series=China Academic Library|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31181-9}}</ref> Some of his claims{{clarify|reason=There's probably a better word than \"claims\" here|date=May 2019}} include:\n\n# A thoroughly democratized social structure by an equal inheritance system among sons and the right to rebel under oppressive regimes.\n# Widespread accessibility of political participation through civil service exams.\n# Intragovernmental criticism and censorial control formalized by governmental institutions and the Confucian tradition of political criticism.\n\n=== Constitutionalism and Human Rights Movement ===\nIn 1928, Hu along with [[Xu Zhimo]], [[Wen Yiduo]], [[Chen Yuan (historian)|Chen Yuan]] and [[Liang Shih-chiu|Liang Shiqiu]] founded the monthly journal ''Crescent Moon'', named after Tagore's prose verse. In March 1929, Shanghai Special Representatives of National Party Chen De proposed to punish any \"anti-revolutionary\" without due process. Hu Shih responded fiercely with an article in ''Crescent Moon'' titled \"Human Rights and Law\" (\u4eba\u6743\u4e0e\u7ea6\u6cd5). In the article, Hu called for the establishment of a written constitution that protects the rights of citizens, especially from the ruling government. The government must be held accountable to the constitution. Later in \"When Can We Have Constitution\u2013A Question for ''The Outline of National Reconstruction''\" (\u6211\u4eec\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u624d\u53ef\u6709\u5baa\u6cd5? \u2014\u2014 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u300a\u5efa\u56fd\u5927\u7eb2\u300b\u7684\u7591\u95ee), Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in ''The Outline of National Reconstruction''. Rejecting [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s claim that people are incapable of self-rule, Hu considered democracy itself a form of political education. The legitimacy and the competency of people participating in the political process comes from their lived experience.\n\n=== Criticism of the Chinese Communist Party after 1949 ===\nIn the early 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party launched a years-long campaign criticizing Hu Shih's thoughts. In response, Hu published many essays in English attacking the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>Zhou, Zhiping (2012). ''\u5149\u7130\u4e0d\u7184\uff1a\u80e1\u9002\u601d\u60f3\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd''. Beijing: Jiuzhou Press. p. 202.</ref>\n\nHu's opposition to the Chinese Communist Party was essentially an ideological conflict. As a supporter of Pragmatism, Hu believed that social changes can only happen incrementally. Revolution or any ideologies that claim to solve social problems once and for all are not possible. Such a perspective was present in his early writing, as in the ''problem'' versus ''isms'' debate. He often quotes from John Dewey: \"progress is not a wholesale matter, but a retail job, to be contracted for and executed in section.\" Another ideological conflict is with his individualism.{{clarify|date=May 2019}} Hu affirms the right of the individual as independent from the collective. The individual has the right to develop freely and diversely without political suppression in the name of uniformity. He writes in \"The Conflict of Ideologies\":<blockquote>\"The desire for uniformity leads to suppression of individual initiative, to the dwarfing of personality and creative effort, to intolerance, oppression, and slavery, and, worst of all, to intellectual dishonesty and moral hypocrisy.\"<ref>Hu, Shih (November 1941). \"The Conflicts of Ideologies,\" in ''The Annuals of American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 28, p. 32-34.</ref></blockquote>In contrast to a Marxist conception of history, Hu's conception of history is pluralistic and particular. In his talk with American economist Charles A. Beard, recorded in his diary, Hu believed the making of history is only coincidental. Therefore, as a proponent of reformism, pluralism, individualism, and skepticism, Hu's philosophy is irreconcilable with Communist ideologies. Hu's later scholarship around the Chinese root of liberalism and democracy is very consistent with his anti-CCP writings. In a later manuscript titled \"Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern,\" Hu constructs three arguments from Chinese intellectual history, especially from Confucian and Daoist tradition, to combat the authoritative rule of the Chinese Communist Party:<blockquote>1. An almost anarchistic aversion of all governmental interference.</blockquote><blockquote>2. A long tradition of love for freedom and fight for freedom\u2013especially for intellectual freedom and religious freedom, but also for the freedom of political criticism.</blockquote><blockquote>3. A traditional exaltation of the individual's right to doubt and question things\u2013even the most sacred things.<ref>Hu Shih, \"Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern.\"</ref></blockquote>Therefore, Hu regards the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party as not only \"unhistorical,\" but also \"un-Chinese.\"\n\n==Writings==\n\nHu was well known as the primary advocate for the literary revolution of the era, a movement which aimed to replace scholarly classical Chinese in writing with the vernacular spoken language, and to cultivate and stimulate new forms of literature. In an article originally published in ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' in January [[1917 in poetry|1917]] titled \"A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform\", Hu originally emphasized eight guidelines that all Chinese writers should take to heart in writing:\n\n#Write with substance. By this, Hu meant that literature should contain real feeling and human thought. This was intended to be a contrast to the recent poetry with rhymes and phrases that Hu saw as being empty.\n#Do not imitate the ancients. Literature should not be written in the styles of long ago, but rather in the modern style of the present era.\n#Respect grammar. Hu did not elaborate at length on this point, merely stating that some recent forms of poetry had neglected proper grammar.\n#Reject melancholy. Recent young authors often chose grave pen names, and wrote on such topics as death. Hu rejected this way of thinking as being unproductive in solving modern problems.\n#Eliminate old clich\u00e9s. The Chinese language has always had numerous [[Chengyu|four-character sayings and phrases]] used to describe events. Hu implored writers to use their own words in descriptions, and deplored those who did not.\n#Do not use allusions. By this, Hu was referring to the practice of comparing present events with historical events even when there is no meaningful analogy.\n#Do not use couplets or parallelism. Though these forms had been pursued by earlier writers, Hu believed that modern writers first needed to learn the basics of substance and quality, before returning to these matters of subtlety and delicacy.\n#Do not avoid popular expressions or popular forms of characters. This rule, perhaps the most well-known, ties in directly with Hu's belief that modern literature should be written in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. He believed that this practice had historical precedents, and led to greater understanding of important texts.\n\nIn April of [[1918 in poetry|1918]], Hu published a second article in ''New Youth'', this one titled \"Constructive Literary Revolution \u2013 A Literature of National Speech\". In it, he simplified the original eight points into just four:\n\n#Speak only when you have something to say. This is analogous to the first point above.\n#Speak what you want to say and say it in the way you want to say it. This combines points two through six above.\n#Speak what is your own and not that of someone else. This is a rewording of point seven.\n#Speak in the language of the time in which you live. This refers again to the replacement of Classical Chinese with the vernacular language.\n\nThe following excerpt is from a poem titled ''Dream and Poetry'', written in [[vernacular Chinese]] by Hu.
