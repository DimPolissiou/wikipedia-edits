The higher the R-value of an insulation product, the more effective the insulation properties. Spray polyurethane foam comes in a range of densities and cel structure. Low density foams are referred to as Open Cel SPF while higher density foams are referred to as Closed Cel foam.  1.8-2 pound polyurethane foam has the highest R-value of readily available spray foam insulation used in homes and buildings.<ref name=\"toolbase\">[http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/walls/sprayed-foam-insulation Insulation Alternatives: Sprayed Foam Insulation]</ref>\n\nPolyurethane is a closed-cell foam insulation material that initially contains a low-conductivity gas in its cells.<ref name=\"energysavers\">[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11600 Polyurethane Insulation Materials]</ref>  As a result of the high thermal resistance of the gas, spray polyurethane insulation typically has an initial R-value around R-3.4 to R-6.7 per inch.<ref name=\"energysavers\"/>  In comparison, blown fiberglass typically has an R-Value of only R-3 to R-4 per inch.<ref name=\"colorado\">[http://www.coloradoenergy.org/procorner/stuff/r-values.htm Insulation Values For Selected Materials]</ref>\n\nFoam insulation blocks all three forms of heat transfer:\n\n;Conductive heat transfer: The flow of thermal energy through a substance from a higher to a lower temperature region. Foam thermoset plastics reduce conductive heat transfer due in part to having very loose molecular bonds; In addition the cells of the installed spray foam are either filled with air in the case of open cell foam or [[pentafluoropropane|245fa]] in closed cell foam.\n\n;Radiant heat transfer: The process by which heat energy in the form of light (usually IR unless the substrate is hot enough to glow in the visible range) is emitted more strongly by warm surfaces and absorbed by other materials especially those of low IR reflectivity (think matte black finish).  Radiant heat transfer does not require a medium. Foam insulation materials, such as spray foam insulation, are opaque to thermal radiation, like most solid materials.\n\n;Convective heat transfer: Heat which is created elsewhere that is transported by means of a fluid, such as water or in our case air. Spray foam insulation's most important attribute is the ability to air seal creating a custom airtight envelope within the building structure. The added benefit to air sealing is the ability to block convective heat transfer from interior to exterior during heating months and vice versa during cooling months, as the heat cannot escape through gaps in the buildings envelope without the aid of air movement from infiltration as a means of transport.\n\n==Applications==\n{{See also|List of polyurethane applications}}\n\n===Packaging applications===\nSpray foam is a very specialized packing material, often required for use in shipping valuable [[Brittle|fragile]] items. Engineered packaging principles are designed to protect sculptures, vases, large fossils, lamp bases, busts, computers, furniture, chandeliers and other objects of unusual shape. By virtue of the liquid foam expanding by up to 30-60 times the volume of its liquid state, it efficiently protects almost any size, form and weight.\n\nThe custom fit of the molds, top and bottom, securely and uniformly cushions the object. There are many types of alternative materials that can be used to handle more specific needs.\n\n===Building applications===\n[[File:WALLTITE spray foam insulation being applied.jpg|thumb|Walltite insulation foam being sprayed]]\n[[File:Chicago Closed Cell Spray Foam Insulation In Wall.jpg|thumb|Closed cell spray foam being applied by trained installer.]]\n'''Spray foam insulation or spray polyurethane foam (SPF)''' is an alternative to traditional building insulation such as [[Glass wool|fiberglass]]. A two-component mixture composed of [[Polyurethanes|isocyanate]] and [[polyol]] resin comes together at the tip of a gun, and forms an expanding foam that is sprayed onto roof tiles, concrete slabs, into wall cavities, or through holes drilled in into a [[cavity wall|cavity]] of a finished wall.\n\n\"Spray foam\" is also an informal term used to refer to various plastic foam materials that are used in building construction to provide [[thermal insulation]] and minimize [[Infiltration (HVAC)|air infiltration]]. [[Polyurethane]] and [[polyisocyanurate]] are two types of foam used in this application.\n\n====Types====\nSpray polyurethane foam (SPF) insulation can be categorized into two different types: light-density open-cell spray foam insulation and medium-density closed-cell spray foam insulation. Both types of SPF are thermoset cellular plastics comprising millions of small cells.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spray Applied Rigid Polyurethane Insulation Installer Training Program Manual|date=1 October 2014|publisher=CUFCA|page=5}}</ref>[[File:Spray Polyurethane Foam Application.jpg|thumb|Open cell spray polyurethane foam insulation being applied in wall cavities.]]\n\nOpen cell insulation can be crushed in your hand and has a lower insulation value.  Closed cell is rigid to the touch and each air cell is completely sealed.  While closed cell foam has a higher R-value, it is more costly to buy.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://montrealgazette.com/homes/home-renovating/Block+moisture+make+stucco+last/7594628/story.html\n|title=Closed-cell spray foam tops home insulation options\n|publisher=Montreal Gazette\n|accessdate=29 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n'''Medium-Density Closed-Cell Spray Foam (ccSPF)'''\n\nMedium-density closed-cell foam insulation is often referred to as two pound (2&nbsp;lb) foam. It is a rigid insulating material with a Long Term Thermal Resistance (LTTR) R-value that ranges between 5.1 - 6 per inch<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cufca.ca/technical_documents.php|title=Technical Documents {{!}} CUFCA|website=www.cufca.ca|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref> When the required minimum thickness of 50&nbsp;mm is installed, ccSPF is both a vapour barrier and an air barrier.\n\nIn Canada, the National Building Code references two standards that apply to the manufacturing and installation of ccSPF: the CAN/ULC S705.1 Material Standard and the CAN/ULC S705.2 National Application Standard. The installation standard requires that all installers of ccSPF in Canada be licensed and carry a photo ID card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cufca.ca/howto.php|title=What Foam Do I Ask For? / How Do I Know If I Received What I Asked For? {{!}} CUFCA|website=cufca.ca|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nTypically the foam's natural colour is yellow, however in Canada all ccSPF that have CCMC listings are required to have a unique colour for field identification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/ccmc/evaluations.html|title=CMC Registry of Construction Product Evaluations|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Council Canada|access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Light-Density Open-Cell Spray Foam (ocSPF)'''\n\nLight-density open-cell SPF is commonly known as half-pound foam. It is a semi-rigid material with a sponge-like appearance that expands during installation and creates small, open cells that are filled with carbon dioxide. Due to its ability to expand during the application process, it fills cracks, crevices and voids and adheres to irregular surfaces or substrates to form an air sealing insulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Low Density Semi-Rigid Open Cell Training Manual|last=|first=|publisher=CUFCA|year=2014|location=Canada|page=3|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhile the R value will vary, most ocSPF products have an R value of around 3.8 per inch. Unlike medium-density closed-cell SPF, ocSPF is not a vapour barrier. When installed at 5.5 inches or more, ocSPF does act as an air barrier. It is often used for interior walls because it provides sound reduction by blocking and absorbing air leakage. It is usually only recommended for indoor applications.\n\n====Application methods====\n=====Asia=====\nA type of use quite familiar in South East Asian countries is applying the foam by spraying it against the bottom of roof tiles under high pressure with a spray gun. A hard but flexible layer of rigid foam is then created and seals all the tiles to each other and to the steel structure.\n\nThis spraying method, especially very popular in Thailand, is used not only against heavy leaks but helps also as insulation against the enormous heat the roofs constantly face.\n\nThis tropical heat is a cause that the steel structure, which most roofs in that part of the world are built on, expands and contracts all the time. By doing so, the steel structure causes the roof tiles to dislodge and slowly creates small openings between the roof tiles, through which rain water can run into, creating leaks that can cause much damage to plastered ceilings and electric wiring.\n\n=====Europe=====\nSome 150,000 properties have been treated with polyurethane foam insulation in the UK. There are systems which have British Board of Agreement approval for use in existing and new build applications and can show compliance to Building Regulations.\n\n=====North America=====\nThe Canadian National Building Code references the CAN/ULC S705.2 National Application Standard which must be followed during all installations of 2lb medium density closed cell polyurethane foam. Every installer of CAN/ULC-S705.1 compliant medium density, spray applied foam must be licensed in order to spray foam and hold valid photo ID issued by their Quality Assurance Program (QAP) provider showing their license is in good standing. \n\nThe United States has adapted to using sprayfoam insulation and a new technology called Wall Injection to retrofit existing wall construction by drilling small holes between wall studs in the structures framing and filling the void with a less aggressive expanding water-based foam. This allows existing home and business owners to conserve energy by creating a thermal envelope in their existing structure.\n\n====Benefits====\nSpray foam insulation, like other insulation, saves on energy costs and lowers utility bills. Studies by the [[US Department of Energy]] show that 40% of a home's energy is lost as the result of air [[infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] through walls, windows and doorways. Buildings treated with spray foam insulation insulate as much as 50% better than traditional insulation products.\n\nInsulation properly deployed can be part of a system designed to protect against [[Damp (structural)|moisture]], which provides the benefit of reducing the chance of harmful [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], [[mildew]] and rotting of wood.\n\nIn addition to building [[temperature]] and moisture control, spray foam insulation is often used to reduce noise. Foam insulation serves as a [[noise barrier|barrier]] to airborne sounds, and reduces [[airborne sound]] transfer through a building's roof, floor and walls compared an uninsulated structure.<ref name=\"swis\">[https://www.mtr.im/services/spray-foam-insulation/ Spray foam insulation benefits]</ref>\n\nIn the United States, homes treated with spray foam insulation often qualify for state and federal tax deductions.<ref name=\"energystar\">[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index Federal Tax Credits for Consumer Energy Efficiency]</ref>\n\nInsulation of all types stops a good deal of energy loss. Some types including spray foams also seal air leaks. Insulation can also save energy in hot climates by reducing air conditioning use.\n\n==Blowing Agent Climate Impact==\nMost closed-cell spray foam is now formed using [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) [[blowing agent]]s that have high global warming potential, partially or completely offsetting the climate benefits of the energy savings they can offer.  In the United States, HFCs are scheduled to be phased out by January, 2021.  A few spray foam suppliers have started supplying spray foam blown with \n[[hydrofluoroolefin]] (HFO) blowing agents without this problem as of early 2017.<ref>\"Next Generation Spray Foams Trickle into the Market,\" Scott Gibson, Green Building Advisor, [http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/green-building-news/next-generation-spray-foams-trickle-market]</ref>\n\n==Health effects==\n{{medical citations needed|date=August 2016}}\nSpray foam insulation is typically [[non-toxic]] only after it has cured. While curing, spray foam emits a gas that causes blurred vision and trouble breathing. Using full face and respiratory protection while applying the product is recommended.\n\n[[Isocyanates]] are powerful irritants to the eyes and gastrointestinal as well as the respiratory tracts. Direct skin contact with isocyanates can also cause marked inflammation. Some people say that their eyes feel like they have sand in them at the onset of problems. Some break out in a rash on their arms, chest, and neck.\n\nOverexposure to isocyanates can sensitize workers, making them subject to asthma attacks if they are exposed again. Respiratory irritation may progress to a chemical bronchitis. Additional exposures can make the onset easier with less isocyanate necessary to start the attack.\n\t\nSporadic cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) have also been reported in workers exposed to isocyanates. The symptoms may seem like the flu, with fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Other symptoms may include a dry cough, chest tightness, and difficult breathing. Individuals with chronic HP often experience progressively more difficult breathing, fatigue, and weight loss. Individuals with acute HP typically develop symptoms 4\u20136 hours after exposure.<ref name=\"toolbase\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Building insulation materials]]\n*[[Insulation (list of insulation material)]]\n*[[R-value (insulation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Building materials]]\n[[Category:Building insulation materials]]\n[[Category:Sustainable building]]\n[[Category:Thermal protection]]\n[[Category:Energy conservation]]\n[[Category:Heat transfer]]\n[[Category:Packaging]]\nalso reffer [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/69303/3/Khazabi_Mustafa_201506_PhD_thesis.pdf]\n", "text_old": "{{unbalanced|article about a commercial product's advantages and disadvantages|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Found foam insulation.jpg|thumb|Spray foam insulation extruding from a duct.]]\n'''Spray foam''' is a chemical product created by two materials, [[isocyanate]] and [[polyol]] resin, which react when mixed with each other and expand up to 30-60 times its liquid volume after it is sprayed in place.

The book describes the [[German Empire|German]] soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these [[Soldier|soldiers]] upon returning home from the front.\n\nThe novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'' (1930), were among the books banned and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Eksteins\n  | first = Modris\n  | title = All Quiet on the Western Front and the Fate of a War\n  | journal = Journal of Contemporary History\n  | volume = 15\n  | issue = 2\n  | page = 353\n  | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]]\n  | date = April 1980\n  | doi = 10.1177/002200948001500207 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was adapted again in 1979 by [[Delbert Mann]], this time as [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|a television film]] starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]].\n\n==Title and translation==\nThe English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''. The literal translation of \"Im Westen nichts Neues\" is \"Nothing New In the West,\" with \"West\" being the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the novel.\n\n[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation rendered the phrase as \"there was nothing new to report on the Western Front\" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:\n\n<blockquote>\nAlthough it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe phrase \"all quiet on the Western Front\" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/all+quiet+on+the+Western+Front|title=all quiet on the Western Front|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book tells the story of Paul B\u00e4umer, who belongs to a group of German soldiers on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. The patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek had led the whole class to volunteer for military service shortly after the start of [[World War I]].  He didn't have any experience when going into the war but he still went in with an open mind and a kind heart. Paul lived with his father, mother, and sister in a charming German village, and attended school.  His class was \"scattered over the platoons amongst [[Frisians|Frisian]] fishermen, peasants, and labourers.\" B\u00e4umer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, M\u00fcller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, \"This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"DestroyedByWar\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYPUw18AC&pg=PA48&dq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}</ref> The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail.\n\nThe battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for B\u00e4umer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. \"We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.\"\n\nPaul's visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does \"not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world.\"  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him \"stupid and distressing\" questions about his war experiences, not understanding \"that a man cannot talk of such things.\"  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their \"own little sector\" of the war but nothing of the big picture.\n\nIndeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, \"Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it.\"  In the end, he concludes that he \"ought never to have come [home] on leave.\"\n\nPaul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.\nThey are then sent on what Paul calls a \"good job.\" They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.\nPaul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.\n\nBy now, the war is nearing its end and the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.\n\nIn October 1918, Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: \"All quiet on the Western Front.\" Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, \"as though almost glad the end had come.\"\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that \"[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"Destroyer\">{{cite book|URL=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYZALI010199PUw18AC&pg=PA48&sq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}</ref> This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]\n\n===Albert Kropp===\nKropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a [[amputation|leg amputation]]. Both he and B\u00e4umer end up spending time in a [[Catholic]] hospital together, B\u00e4umer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie and a lack of a revolver. Kropp and B\u00e4umer part ways when B\u00e4umer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was \"very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with.\"<ref>Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front</ref>\n\n===Haie Westhus===\nHaie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humour. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)\u2014the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelsto\u00df (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.\n\n===Friedrich M\u00fcller===\nM\u00fcller is 19 and one of B\u00e4umer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he \"mutters propositions in physics\". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a \"light pistol\" (flare gun). As he was dying \"quite conscious and in terrible pain\", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.\n\n===Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky===\nKat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler ([[shoemaker]]) in civilian life; he is older than Paul B\u00e4umer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, B\u00e4umer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.\n\nKat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. B\u00e4umer describes Kat as possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]. One night, B\u00e4umer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.\n\nKat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes B\u00e4umer indifferent as to whether he survives the war or not, yet certain that he can face the rest of his life without fear. \"Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear.\"\n\n=== Tjaden ===\n{{Redirect|Tjaden|the architect|Olive Frances Tjaden}}\nOne of B\u00e4umer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelsto\u00df (thanks to his strict \"disciplinary actions\"), he manages to forgive Himmelsto\u00df later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as \"thin as a rake\". He appears in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]''.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Kantorek===\nKantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, M\u00fcller, and Behm. Behaving \"in a way that cost [him] nothing,\" Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages B\u00e4umer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.\n\nKantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelst\u00e4dt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.\n\n===Peter Leer===\nLeer is an intelligent soldier in B\u00e4umer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. B\u00e4umer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying \"Leer is an old hand at the game\". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, \"What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?\"<ref>''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam & Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), p. 240.</ref>\n\n===Bertinck===\nLieutenant Bertinck is the leader of B\u00e4umer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. In the beginning of the book, he permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who allowed them only their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.\n\nWhen he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.\n\n===Himmelstoss===\nCorporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelsto\u00df in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them \"hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough\" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.\n\nHimmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul B\u00e4umer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to B\u00e4umer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelsto\u00df later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for B\u00e4umer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.\n\n===Detering===\nDetering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, \"It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war,\" when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of their misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.\n\n===Josef Hamacher===\nHamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a \"Special Permit,\" certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.\n\n===Franz Kemmerich===\nA young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, B\u00e4umer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, M\u00fcller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.\n\n===Joseph Behm===\nA student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around no man's land, it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.\n\n==Publication and reception==\nFrom November 10 to December 9, 1928, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was published in serial form in ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in [[World War I]] had waned more than 10 years after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors\u2014soldiers and civilians alike\u2014and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.\n\nWith ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, \"destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells.\" Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging [[Nazi Party]] and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' became one of the first [[degenerate art|degenerate books]] to be publicly burnt;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/remarque-publishes-all-quiet-on-the-western-front|title=Nov 10, 1928: Remarque publishes All Quiet on the Western Front|work=[[History.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> in 1930, screenings of the [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|Academy Award-winning film based on the book]] were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.<ref name=SI>{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, objections to Remarque's portrayal of the World War I German army personnel were not limited to those of the Nazis in 1933. Dr. Karl Kroner ([[:de:Karl Kroner|de]]) was concerned about Remarque's depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: \u201cPeople abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?\u201d<ref name=\"clardy\">{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615102102/http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 15, 2013|title=All Quiet on the Western Front: Reception|author=Patrick Clardy|work=Yale Modernism Lab|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"barker\">{{cite book|first1=Christine R.|last1=Barker|first2=Rex William|last2=Last|title=Erich Maria Remarque|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nA fellow patient of Remarque's in the military hospital in [[Duisburg]] objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: \u201cThere were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.\u201d<ref name=\"barker\"/>\n\nThese criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time. This perspective is crucial to understanding the true effects of World War I. The evidence can be seen in the lingering depression that Remarque and many of his friends and acquaintances were suffering a decade later.<ref name=\"clardy\"/>\n\nIn contrast, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was trumpeted by [[pacifists]] as an anti-war book.<ref name=\"barker\"/> Remarque makes a point in the opening statement that the novel does not advocate any political position, but is merely an attempt to describe the experiences of the soldier.<ref>{{cite book|first=Hans|last=Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=uk&id=sPH4NyyUlmAC&dq=0-87249-740-2&q=night+in+lisbon#v=snippet&q=night%20in%20lisbon&f=false|title=Understanding Erich Maria Remarque|location=Columbia, SC|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1991}}</ref>\n\nThe main artistic criticism was that it was a mediocre attempt to cash in on public sentiment.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The enormous popularity the work received was a point of contention for some literary critics, who scoffed at the fact that such a simple work could be so earth-shattering.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Much of this literary criticism came from [[Salomo Friedlaender]], who wrote a book ''Hat Erich Maria Remarque wirklich gelebt?'' \"Did Erich Maria Remarque really live?\" (under pen name Mynona), which was, in its turn, criticized in: ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?'' \"Did Mynona really live?\" by [[Kurt Tucholsky]].<ref>Kurt Tucholsky (under pen name Ignaz Wrobel), [http://www.textlog.de/tucholsky-mynona-wirklich.html ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?''], ''Die Weltb\u00fchne'', December 31, 1929, No. 1, p. 15</ref> Friedlaender's criticism was mainly personal in nature\u2014he attacked Remarque as being ego-centric and greedy.

The book describes the [[German Empire|German]] soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these [[Soldier|soldiers]] upon returning home from the front.\n\nThe novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'' (1930), were among the books banned and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Eksteins\n  | first = Modris\n  | title = All Quiet on the Western Front and the Fate of a War\n  | journal = Journal of Contemporary History\n  | volume = 15\n  | issue = 2\n  | page = 353\n  | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]]\n  | date = April 1980\n  | doi = 10.1177/002200948001500207 }}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was adapted again in 1979 by [[Delbert Mann]], this time as [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|a television film]] starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]].\n\n==Title and translation==\nThe English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''. The literal translation of \"Im Westen nichts Neues\" is \"Nothing New In the West,\" with \"West\" being the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the novel.\n\n[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation rendered the phrase as \"there was nothing new to report on the Western Front\" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:\n\n<blockquote>\nAlthough it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe phrase \"all quiet on the Western Front\" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/all+quiet+on+the+Western+Front|title=all quiet on the Western Front|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book tells the story of Paul B\u00e4umer, who belongs to a group of German soldiers on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. The patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek had led the whole class to volunteer for military service shortly after the start of [[World War I]].  He didn't have any experience when going into the war but he still went in with an open mind and a kind heart. Paul lived with his father, mother, and sister in a charming German village, and attended school.  His class was \"scattered over the platoons amongst [[Frisians|Frisian]] fishermen, peasants, and labourers.\" B\u00e4umer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, M\u00fcller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, \"This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"DestroyedByWar\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYPUw18AC&pg=PA48&dq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}</ref> The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail.\n\nThe battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for B\u00e4umer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. \"We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.\"\n\nPaul's visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does \"not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world.\"  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him \"stupid and distressing\" questions about his war experiences, not understanding \"that a man cannot talk of such things.\"  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their \"own little sector\" of the war but nothing of the big picture.\n\nIndeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, \"Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it.\"  In the end, he concludes that he \"ought never to have come [home] on leave.\"\n\nPaul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.\nThey are then sent on what Paul calls a \"good job.\" They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.\nPaul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.\n\nBy now, the war is nearing its end and the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.\n\nIn October 1918, Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: \"All quiet on the Western Front.\" Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, \"as though almost glad the end had come.\"\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that \"[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\"<ref name=\"Destroyer\">{{cite book|URL=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYZALI010199PUw18AC&pg=PA48&sq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}</ref> This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]\n\n===Albert Kropp===\nKropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a [[amputation|leg amputation]]. Both he and B\u00e4umer end up spending time in a [[Catholic]] hospital together, B\u00e4umer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie and a lack of a revolver. Kropp and B\u00e4umer part ways when B\u00e4umer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was \"very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with.\"<ref>Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front</ref>\n\n===Haie Westhus===\nHaie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humour. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)\u2014the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelsto\u00df (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.\n\n===Friedrich M\u00fcller===\nM\u00fcller is 19 and one of B\u00e4umer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he \"mutters propositions in physics\". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a \"light pistol\" (flare gun). As he was dying \"quite conscious and in terrible pain\", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.\n\n===Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky===\nKat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler ([[shoemaker]]) in civilian life; he is older than Paul B\u00e4umer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, B\u00e4umer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.\n\nKat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. B\u00e4umer describes Kat as possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]. One night, B\u00e4umer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.\n\nKat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes B\u00e4umer indifferent as to whether he survives the war or not, yet certain that he can face the rest of his life without fear. \"Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear.\"\n\n=== Tjaden ===\n{{Redirect|Tjaden|the architect|Olive Frances Tjaden}}\nOne of B\u00e4umer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelsto\u00df (thanks to his strict \"disciplinary actions\"), he manages to forgive Himmelsto\u00df later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as \"thin as a rake\". He appears in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]''.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Kantorek===\nKantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, M\u00fcller, and Behm. Behaving \"in a way that cost [him] nothing,\" Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages B\u00e4umer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.\n\nKantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelst\u00e4dt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.\n\n===Peter Leer===\nLeer is an intelligent soldier in B\u00e4umer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. B\u00e4umer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying \"Leer is an old hand at the game\". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, \"What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?\"<ref>''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam & Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), p. 240.</ref>\n\n===Bertinck===\nLieutenant Bertinck is the leader of B\u00e4umer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. In the beginning of the book, he permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who allowed them only their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.\n\nWhen he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.\n\n===Himmelstoss===\nCorporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelsto\u00df in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them \"hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough\" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, B\u00e4umer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.\n\nHimmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul B\u00e4umer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to B\u00e4umer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelsto\u00df later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for B\u00e4umer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.\n\n===Detering===\nDetering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, \"It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war,\" when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of their misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.\n\n===Josef Hamacher===\nHamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a \"Special Permit,\" certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.\n\n===Franz Kemmerich===\nA young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, B\u00e4umer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, M\u00fcller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.\n\n===Joseph Behm===\nA student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around [[no-man's-land]], it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.\n\n==Publication and reception==\nFrom November 10 to December 9, 1928, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was published in serial form in ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in [[World War I]] had waned more than 10 years after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors\u2014soldiers and civilians alike\u2014and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.\n\nWith ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, \"destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells.\" Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging [[Nazi Party]] and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' became one of the first [[degenerate art|degenerate books]] to be publicly burnt;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/remarque-publishes-all-quiet-on-the-western-front|title=Nov 10, 1928: Remarque publishes All Quiet on the Western Front|work=[[History.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> in 1930, screenings of the [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|Academy Award-winning film based on the book]] were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.<ref name=SI>{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, objections to Remarque's portrayal of the World War I German army personnel were not limited to those of the Nazis in 1933. Dr. Karl Kroner ([[:de:Karl Kroner|de]]) was concerned about Remarque's depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War.

It is {{Convert|2.3|km}} inland in the non coastal zone and is at an elevation of {{Convert|140|m}}. Ahu Vai Teka is at a distance of {{Convert|706.8|m}} from Ahu Kavi which is considered as part of the Ahu Akivi-Ahu Kavi complex.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\nFrom Hanga Roa, an inland road leads to the site via the volcanic cone of [[Terevaka]] ({{Convert|510|m}} peak level). The coast road is via [[Playa Anakena]]. On this road there are many moi statues lying scattered and un restored. There are paths branching off to [[Puna Pau]], which is a quarry of low volcanic crater with red coloured rocks known as [[scoria]], which has been used to carve 70 of the \"top hat\" of the statues known as [[pukao]] which could be cylindrical top knot of hair or grass hat or turban. Further on, the site of Ahu Akivi is reached.{{Sfn|Graham|2003|p=537}} The site is located to the Northeast of [[Hanga Roa]],{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}} the capital city of Easter Island, about {{Convert|10|km}} to its north.<ref name=Easter/>\n \nThe Rano Raraku quarry from where the statues were made is at least {{Convert|15|km}} away and free access is through the land route held by the clans.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\n==History==\nAhu Akivi is part of the Ahu Akivi-Vai Teka complex which was built up by the Rapa Nui people in two phases. In the first phase, during the 16th century a central rectangular platform was created on a leveled surface. It  had wings projecting to the north and the south directions. An approach ramp was also part of this platform which led to the ceremonial plaza stretching {{Convert|25|m}} towards the west of the central platform. A cremation ground existed behind the central platform. The second phase of construction was elaborately planned and implemented in the early years of the 17th century when the platform was modified, a ramp was created, seven statues of equal size were erected. Another crematorium was also built. A cave in which people used to reside was also used as tomb during historic times.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\nThe other Ahu in the complex is the [[Ahu Vai Teka]], which is a much smaller platform of {{Convert|16|m}} length made up of rough lava stone blocks. There is no statue now, though one is believed to have existed initially. Both the ahus were believed to have been aligned astronomically with respect to the Sun. Both are located in the territory of the Miru, the highest ranking clan and the western confederacy, and  both were contemporary. It is also conjectured that the seven statues were placed at Ahu Akivi at least 150 years before the first Europeans found the island when the clan was functional at that time. It is also evident that their culture existed for 250\u2013300 years with economic prosperity with political stability.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\nIn 1955, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] recruited American archaeologist [[William Mulloy]] and his Chilean associate, Gonzalo Figueroa Garc\u00eda-Huidobro, who restored the statues to their original position; they had found them in knocked down condition in 1960.<ref name=Stones/> Mulloy's work on the Akivi-Vaiteka Complex was supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and by grants from the [[University of Wyoming]], the [[University of Chile]] and the [[World Monument Fund|International Fund for Monuments]]. Ahu Akivi also gives its name to one of the seven regions of [[Rapa Nui National Park]].<ref name=Stones/>\n\n==Legend==\nThe statues on the island invariably faced the village as a protective mana, but in the case of the Ahu Akivi statues they face towards the sea. There is a legend narrated for this positioning of the seven statues. It is conjectured that the [[Rapanui people]] did it to propitiate the sea to help the navigators. However, according to an oral tradition, Hotu Matu\u2019s priest had a dream in which the King's soul flew across the ocean when the Rapa Nui island was seen by him. He then sent scouts navigating across the sea to locate the island and to find people to settle there. Seven of these scouts stayed back on the island waiting for the king to arrive. These seven are represented by the seven stone statues erected in their honour.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}<ref name=Easter/>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Easterstatues.jpg|right|thumb|Closer view of Ahu Akivi statues]]\nThe architectural features of an Ahu platform were discerned by archaeologists, depending on its length under five categories. These are: A central platform of varying length; platform made of crude masonry in its rear wall or with fine masonry in the rear wall; with or without wings; with one or more statues; a red scoria top knot (headgear), ramp, a crematoriums plaza pavement, crafted front retaining wall, a cornice made of red scoria. In the case of the Ahu Akivi all these features have been noted except that the rear part of the platform is made of crude masonry wall.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}} Another feature of the foundation of the platform is that the stones used to make it are not from the island but were brought as ballast in the 19th century in a ship.<ref name=Easter/>\n\nApart from the above, archeologists also unearthed stone disks, small statues, and fish hooks made of stones and bones indicative of burial ceremonies that were performed at the site.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}\n\nThe seven moai statues are located with absolute astronomical precision. Thus, the sacred observatory and sanctuary with all the seven moai look exactly towards the point where the sun sets during the equinox and which also aligns with the Moon. Each one is of {{Convert|16|ft}} height and weighs about 18 tons,{{Sfn|Maras|2010|p=25}} and its length is {{Convert|70|m}}.<ref name=Easter/>\n\nDuring the excavations done here, the archaeologists also found tree root [[Mold (fungus)|moulds]], indicative of vegetative cover in the past.{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}}\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1960, when the American archaeologist and his associate carried out restoration, it took them one month to rise and fix the first moai in place. They used a stone ramp and two wooden levers to carry out this operation. However, they took less than a week to raise the seventh one.<ref name=Akivi>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/explore/ahuakivi.html|title= Ahu Akivi|accessdate=13 August 2013|publisher=NOVA Online and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Organization}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rapa Nui National Park]]\n*[[Moai]]\n*[[Easter Island]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last1= Flenley |first1=John |last2= Bahn |first2=Paul |title=The Enigmas of Easter Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1xCKNncacEC&pg=PA250|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=29 May 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-158791-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Graham |first=Melissa |title=Rough Guide to Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKkqxfIGRQC&pg=PA537|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-062-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Kirch |first=Patrick Vinton |title=Island Societies: Archaeological Approaches to Evolution and Transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA73|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30189-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Maras |first=Drew Ryan |title=Open Your Eyes: To 2012 and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bH_99uFKPLMC&pg=PA25|date=May 2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-8245-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1= Peregrine |first1=Peter Neal |last2= Ember |first2=Melvin |title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 3: East Asia and Oceania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xu_Q0WGdw7YC&pg=PA51|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46257-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Spitzer |first=Daniel |title=Let's Go Chile 2nd Edition: Including Easter Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0J_bhLkXIkC&pg=PA498|date=13 December 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-33560-1|ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mulloy, W.T. 1968.

The coast road is via [[Playa Anakena]]. On this road there are many moi statues lying scattered and un restored. There are paths branching off to [[Puna Pau]], which is a quarry of low volcanic crater with red coloured rocks known as [[scoria]], which has been used to carve 70 of the \"top hat\" of the statues known as [[pukao]] which could be cylindrical top knot of hair or grass hat or turban. Further on, the site of Ahu Akivi is reached.{{Sfn|Graham|2003|p=537}} The site is located to the Northeast of [[Hanga Roa]],{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}} the capital city of Easter Island, about {{Convert|10|km}} to its north.<ref name=Easter/>\n \nThe Rano Raraku quarry from where the statues were made is at least {{Convert|15|km}} away and free access is through the land route held by the clans.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\n==History==\nAhu Akivi is part of the Ahu Akivi-Vai Teka complex which was built up by the Rapa Nui people in two phases. In the first phase, during the 16th century a central rectangular platform was created on a leveled surface. It  had wings projecting to the north and the south directions. An approach ramp was also part of this platform which led to the ceremonial plaza stretching {{Convert|25|m}} towards the west of the central platform. A cremation ground existed behind the central platform. The second phase of construction was elaborately planned and implemented in the early years of the 17th century when the platform was modified, a ramp was created, seven statues of equal size were erected. Another crematorium was also built. A cave in which people used to reside was also used as tomb during historic times.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\nThe other Ahu in the complex is the [[Ahu Vai Teka]], which is a much smaller platform of {{Convert|16|m}} length made up of rough lava stone blocks. There is no statue now, though one is believed to have existed initially. Both the ahus were believed to have been aligned astronomically with respect to the Sun. Both are located in the territory of the Miru, the highest ranking clan and the western confederacy, and  both were contemporary. It is also conjectured that the seven statues were placed at Ahu Akivi at least 150 years before the first Europeans found the island when the clan was functional at that time. It is also evident that their culture existed for 250\u2013300 years with economic prosperity with political stability.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}\n\nIn 1955, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] recruited American archaeologist [[William Mulloy]] and his Chilean associate, Gonzalo Figueroa Garc\u00eda-Huidobro, who restored the statues to their original position; they had found them in knocked down condition in 1960.<ref name=Stones/> Mulloy's work on the Akivi-Vaiteka Complex was supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and by grants from the [[University of Wyoming]], the [[University of Chile]] and the [[World Monument Fund|International Fund for Monuments]]. Ahu Akivi also gives its name to one of the seven regions of [[Rapa Nui National Park]].<ref name=Stones/>\n\n==Legend==\nThe statues on the island invariably faced the village as a protective mana, but in the case of the Ahu Akivi statues they face towards the sea. There is a legend narrated for this positioning of the seven statues. It is conjectured that the [[Rapanui people]] did it to propitiate the sea to help the navigators. However, according to an oral tradition, Hotu Matu\u2019s priest had a dream in which the King's soul flew across the ocean when the Rapa Nui island was seen by him. He then sent scouts navigating across the sea to locate the island and to find people to settle there. Seven of these scouts stayed back on the island waiting for the king to arrive. These seven are represented by the seven stone statues erected in their honour.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}<ref name=Easter/>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Easterstatues.jpg|right|thumb|Closer view of Ahu Akivi statues]]\nThe architectural features of an Ahu platform were discerned by archaeologists, depending on its length under five categories. These are: A central platform of varying length; platform made of crude masonry in its rear wall or with fine masonry in the rear wall; with or without wings; with one or more statues; a red scoria top knot (headgear), ramp, a crematoriums plaza pavement, crafted front retaining wall, a cornice made of red scoria. In the case of the Ahu Akivi all these features have been noted except that the rear part of the platform is made of crude masonry wall.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}} Another feature of the foundation of the platform is that the stones used to make it are not from the island but were brought as ballast in the 19th century in a ship.<ref name=Easter/>\n\nApart from the above, archeologists also unearthed stone disks, small statues, and fish hooks made of stones and bones indicative of burial ceremonies that were performed at the site.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}\n\nThe seven moai statues are located with absolute astronomical precision. Thus, the sacred observatory and sanctuary with all the seven moai look exactly towards the point where the sun sets during the equinox and which also aligns with the Moon. Each one is of {{Convert|16|ft}} height and weighs about 18 tons,{{Sfn|Maras|2010|p=25}} and its length is {{Convert|70|m}}.<ref name=Easter/>\n\nDuring the excavations done here, the archaeologists also found tree root [[Mold|moulds]], indicative of vegetative cover in the past.{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}}\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1960, when the American archaeologist and his associate carried out restoration, it took them one month to rise and fix the first moai in place. They used a stone ramp and two wooden levers to carry out this operation. However, they took less than a week to raise the seventh one.<ref name=Akivi>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/explore/ahuakivi.html|title= Ahu Akivi|accessdate=13 August 2013|publisher=NOVA Online and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Organization}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rapa Nui National Park]]\n*[[Moai]]\n*[[Easter Island]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last1= Flenley |first1=John |last2= Bahn |first2=Paul |title=The Enigmas of Easter Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1xCKNncacEC&pg=PA250|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=29 May 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-158791-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Graham |first=Melissa |title=Rough Guide to Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKkqxfIGRQC&pg=PA537|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-062-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Kirch |first=Patrick Vinton |title=Island Societies: Archaeological Approaches to Evolution and Transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA73|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30189-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Maras |first=Drew Ryan |title=Open Your Eyes: To 2012 and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bH_99uFKPLMC&pg=PA25|date=May 2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-8245-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1= Peregrine |first1=Peter Neal |last2= Ember |first2=Melvin |title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 3: East Asia and Oceania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xu_Q0WGdw7YC&pg=PA51|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46257-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last= Spitzer |first=Daniel |title=Let's Go Chile 2nd Edition: Including Easter Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0J_bhLkXIkC&pg=PA498|date=13 December 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-33560-1|ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mulloy, W.T. 1968.
