Its name is [[Latin]] for [[T-square|normal]], referring to a [[surface normal|right angle]], and is variously considered to represent a [[Ruler|rule]], a [[carpenter's square]], a [[set square]] or a [[spirit level|level]]. It remains one of the [[88 modern constellations]].\n\nFour of Norma's brighter stars\u2014Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta\u2014make up a square in the field of faint stars. [[Gamma2 Normae|Gamma<sup>2</sup> Normae]] is the brightest star with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.0. [[Mu Normae]] is one of the most [[luminosity|luminous]] stars known, with a luminosity between a quarter million and one million times that of the Sun. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. The [[Milky Way]] passes through Norma, and the constellation contains eight [[open cluster]]s visible to observers with binoculars. The constellation also hosts Abell&nbsp;3627, also called the [[Norma Cluster]], one of the most massive [[galaxy cluster]]s known.\n\n==History==\nNorma was introduced in 1751\u201352 by [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] with the French name ''l\u2019\u00c9querre et la R\u00e8gle'', \"the Square and Rule\",<ref name=ridpathlac>{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title=Lacaille\u2019s Southern Planisphere of 1756 | work= Star Tales |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]] |publisher=Self-published | accessdate= 19 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Lacaille, Nicolas-Louis |year=1756|title= Relation abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-esp\u00e9rance | journal = M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences| page=519\u2013 [589]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f787 |language=French}}</ref> after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] ordered [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]]; Richardson refused and resigned effective immediately. Nixon then ordered [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William Ruckelshaus]] to fire Cox; Ruckelshaus refused, and also resigned. Nixon then ordered the third-most-senior official at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]], to fire Cox. Bork considered resigning{{Source?}}, but instead carried out the dismissal as Nixon asked. \n\nThe political and public reactions to Nixon's actions were negative and highly damaging to the president. The [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon]] began 10 days later, on October 30, 1973. [[Leon Jaworski]] was appointed as the new special prosecutor on November 1, 1973,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=19731101&id=q00iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k6wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2082,4677|title=Attorney General, Prosecutor Picked|work=[[The Argus-Press]]|date=November 1, 1973|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> and on November 14, 1973, United States District Judge [[Gerhard Gesell]] ruled that the dismissal had been illegal.<ref name= noble/><ref>''[[Ralph Nader|Nader]] v.

The appointment was created as a career reserved position in the Justice department, meaning it came under the authority of the attorney general who could only remove the special prosecutor \"for cause\", e.g., gross improprieties or malfeasance in office. Richardson had, in his confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate, promised not to use his authority to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor, unless for cause.<ref name=\"Discovery\">{{cite AV media|date=1994 |title=Watergate|volume=Volume 2: The Conspiracy Crumbles.

On Friday, October 19, 1973, Nixon offered what was later known as the [[Stennis Compromise]]&nbsp;\u2013 asking the infamously [[deaf|hard-of-hearing]] Senator [[John C. Stennis]] of [[Mississippi]] to review and summarize the tapes for the special prosecutor's office.

I was completely numb. At the time, I was dating Dennis Rodman. He was such a fun person to be around, and we went out every night. I remember thinking, this is my out. I'm just going to have fun, and I'm not going to worry about anything. Right after my mom and sister died, I flew to Las Vegas and Dennis and I got married. I guess I was trying to cling to whatever I had. I'd lost my mom and my sister; I didn't want to lose anyone else. We were married for about five months. When I started going through some really hard times with Dennis, I became addicted to feeling that pain instead of dealing with my feelings about my mom and sister. But at some point, I realized I had to stop blaming him. So I got out of my marriage and started reading a lot of self-help books and watching Oprah [Winfrey]. And one day Oprah said, ''In order to heal, you have to feel.'' At that moment I realized I wasn't letting myself feel what I needed to.<ref name=Glamour /></blockquote>\n\nOn November 22, 2003, Electra married [[Dave Navarro]], lead guitarist for the rock band [[Jane's Addiction]].

I was completely numb. At the time, I was dating Dennis Rodman. He was such a fun person to be around, and we went out every night. I remember thinking, this is my out. I'm just going to have fun, and I'm not going to worry about anything. Right after my mom and sister died, I flew to Las Vegas and Dennis and I got married. I guess I was trying to cling to whatever I had. I'd lost my mom and my sister; I didn't want to lose anyone else. We were married for about five months. When I started going through some really hard times with Dennis, I became addicted to feeling that pain instead of dealing with my feelings about my mom and sister. But at some point, I realized I had to stop blaming him. So I got out of my marriage and started reading a lot of self-help books and watching Oprah [Winfrey]. And one day Oprah said, ''In order to heal, you have to feel.'' At that moment I realized I wasn't letting myself feel what I needed to.<ref name=Glamour /></blockquote>\n\nOn November 22, 2003, Electra married [[Dave Navarro]], lead guitarist for the rock band [[Jane's Addiction]].

The Games combine summer and winter Olympic events.\n\nThe event is covered mostly by Barbara Warblers, a stork, and \"anchorturtle\" Henry Hummel. The [[100-meter dash]] is covered in the style of a [[drag racing|drag race]] by Jackie Fuelit.\n\nUnlike the real Olympics, continents are represented rather than countries. The continents featured are North America, South America, [[Eurasia]], Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Eurasia represents the [[USSR]], whereas Europe represents Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe only mention of areas other than continents are the New York City Rats soccer team, Dean Wilson being from California, a Central American marathon runner named Pep\u00e9 Repanosa, an [[Acapulco]] cliff diver named \"Primo Cabeza\", marathon runner Terry Hornsby being from [[Boulder, Colorado]], Ren\u00e9 Fromage being from France, and Kurt W\u00fcfner appearing at the [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] event right before a [[Scandinavia]]n is given a gold medal.\n\nAlthough many of the segments stand alone, there are some recurring events and important characters. The largest such story is the coverage of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], where competitors Ren\u00e9 Fromage and Kit Mambo are the favorites to win. Both are determined to win \u2013 Fromage having devoted his entire life to the marathon, Mambo determined to make a name for herself \u2013 they find themselves surprised when their minds wander to thoughts of mutual admiration and then to love, culminating in the pair holding hands for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line together.  Another important story is that of Kurt W\u00fcffner, a West German [[dachshund]] [[skiing|skier]], and his disappearance to [[Shangri-la|Dogra-la]] during a mountain climbing expedition shortly after the [[slalom skiing|slalom]] event.\n\nA minor story features an [[American alligator|alligator]] named Bolt Jenkins. He was \"born as a handbag\" and told he would never walk again. A song during his story reveals that he lives in the [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]. After seeing a frog named Boris Amphibiensky break the world record for the [[high jump]], Jenkins has an epiphany, and becomes determined to break the record. Jenkins goes on to set world records in the high jump, the [[pole vault]], and later the [[100-meter dash]]. Jenkins sacrifices his gold medal in the hundred meter dash to an African competitor and favorite whom Jenkins considers to be his superior.\n\nSome events are only referenced rather than being covered. In the song \"We've Made It to the Top\", various events are shown that are otherwise not covered:\n*[[Hammer Throw]]\n*[[Shot put]]\n*[[Javelin throw|Javelin]]\n*[[Cycling]]\n*[[Relay Racing]]\n*[[Discus]]\n*[[Field hockey]]\n\nAlso referenced but not covered:\n*[[Boxing]]- only a highlight reel is provided after the match, despite being previewed as \"coming up after the basketball game\"\n*[[Speed Skating]]- previewed, but not actually shown\n*[[Water Polo]]- mentioned as happening earlier in the week\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gilda Radner]] as Barbra Warblers / Brenda Springer / Cora Lee Perrier / Tatyana Tushenko / Dorrie Turnell / The Contessa\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Rugs Turkell / Joey Gongolong / Art Antica\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Keen Hacksaw / Mayor of Animalympic Island / Burnt Woody / Mark Spritz\n* Michael Fremer as Henry Hummel / Ren\u00e9 Fromage / Kit Mambo / Bolt Jenkins / Kurt Wuffner / Dean Wilson / Mele / Count Maurice Boar-Deaux / Jackie Fuelit / Bear McLane / Guy Lafluke / Bjorn Freeborg / Mamo Ululu\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Animalympics/|title=Animalympics|work=Behind the Voice Actors|date=September 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Animalympics'' was commissioned by [[NBC]] in 1978, as the network intended [[Lisberger Studios]] to create it as two hour-long specials to be paired alongside coverage of both the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] then held in [[Moscow]]. But after the [[Soviet Union]] had [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|invaded and gained control of Afghanistan]], then [[United States]] President [[Jimmy Carter]] decided to [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott the Moscow Summer Olympics]].

The Games combine summer and winter Olympic events.\n\nThe event is covered mostly by Barbara Warblers, a stork, and \"anchorturtle\" Henry Hummel. The [[100-meter dash]] is covered in the style of a [[drag racing|drag race]] by Jackie Fuelit.\n\nUnlike the real Olympics, continents are represented rather than countries. The continents featured are North America, South America, [[Eurasia]], Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Eurasia represents the [[USSR]], whereas Europe represents Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe only mention of areas other than continents are the New York City Rats soccer team, Dean Wilson being from California, a Central American marathon runner named Pep\u00e9 Repanosa, an [[Acapulco]] cliff diver named \"Primo Cabeza\", marathon runner Terry Hornsby being from [[Boulder, Colorado]], Ren\u00e9 Fromage being from France, and Kurt W\u00fcfner appearing at the [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] event right before a [[Scandinavia]]n is given a gold medal.\n\nAlthough many of the segments stand alone, there are some recurring events and important characters. The largest such story is the coverage of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], where competitors Ren\u00e9 Fromage and Kit Mambo are the favorites to win. Both are determined to win \u2013 Fromage having devoted his entire life to the marathon, Mambo determined to make a name for herself \u2013 they find themselves surprised when their minds wander to thoughts of mutual admiration and then to love, culminating in the pair holding hands for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line together.  Another important story is that of Kurt W\u00fcffner, a West German [[dachshund]] [[skiing|skier]], and his disappearance to [[Shangri-la|Dogra-la]] during a mountain climbing expedition shortly after the [[slalom skiing|slalom]] event.\n\nA minor story features an [[American alligator|alligator]] named Bolt Jenkins. He was \"born as a handbag\" and told he would never walk again. A song during his story reveals that he lives in the [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]. After seeing a frog named Boris Amphibiensky break the world record for the [[high jump]], Jenkins has an epiphany, and becomes determined to break the record. Jenkins goes on to set world records in the high jump, the [[pole vault]], and later the [[100-meter dash]]. Jenkins sacrifices his gold medal in the hundred meter dash to an African competitor and favorite whom Jenkins considers to be his superior.\n\nSome events are only referenced rather than being covered. In the song \"We've Made It to the Top\", various events are shown that are otherwise not covered:\n*[[Hammer Throw]]\n*[[Shot put]]\n*[[Javelin throw|Javelin]]\n*[[Cycling]]\n*[[Relay Racing]]\n*[[Discus]]\n*[[Field hockey]]\n\nAlso referenced but not covered:\n*[[Boxing]]- only a highlight reel is provided after the match, despite being previewed as \"coming up after the basketball game\"\n*[[Speed Skating]]- previewed, but not actually shown\n*[[Water Polo]]- mentioned as happening earlier in the week\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gilda Radner]] as Barbra Warblers / Brenda Springer / Cora Lee Perrier / Tatyana Tushenko / Dorrie Turnell / The Contessa\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Rugs Turkell / Joey Gongolong / Art Antica\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Keen Hacksaw / Mayor of Animalympic Island / Burnt Woody / Mark Spritz\n* Michael Fremer as Henry Hummel / Ren\u00e9 Fromage / Kit Mambo / Bolt Jenkins / Kurt Wuffner / Dean Wilson / Mele / Count Maurice Boar-Deaux / Jackie Fuelit / Bear McLane / Guy Lafluke / Bjorn Freeborg / Mamo Ululu\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Animalympics/|title=Animalympics|work=Behind the Voice Actors|date=September 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Animalympics'' was commissioned by [[NBC]] in 1978, as the network intended [[Lisberger Studios]] to create it as two hour-long specials to be paired alongside coverage of both the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] then held in [[Moscow]].

The schooner ''Priscilla C. Ferguson'' was acquired by a group headed by A. F. W.

To replace the 24 pound rifled gun that the privateer's crew had spiked,<ref name = \"DCS\"/> the navy armed the ''Beauregard'' with a single 30 pound rifle and two 12 pound [[howitzers]].<ref name = \"DUS\"/>  The ship was allocated to the [[East Gulf Blockading Squadron]], then commanded by Flag Officer [[William McKean]].

It is a carnivorous [[reptile]] that lives along slow-moving rivers, lakes, seasonally [[flooded savanna]]s of the [[Amazon basin]], and in other freshwater habitats of South America. It is a quite large species, growing to at least {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and possibly up to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, which makes it the third largest reptile in the [[Neotropical realm]], behind the [[American crocodile]] and the critically endangered [[Orinoco crocodile]].<ref>[http://www.iucncsg.org/content_images/attachments/species_descriptions/Black%20Caiman.pdf Black Caiman (''Melanosuchus niger'')].

In some individuals, the dark coloration can appear almost black. It has grey to brown banding on the lower jaw. Juveniles have a more vibrant coloration compared to adults with prominent white to pale yellow banding on the flanks that remains present well into adulthood, at least more when compared to other species. The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is quite different from other [[caiman]]s but the [[bony ridge]] that occurs in other caimans is present. The head is large and heavy, an advantage in catching larger prey.\n\nThe black caiman is the largest predator in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] [[ecosystem]], preying on a variety of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.<ref name=\"umich1\"/> It is a [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]] and [[apex predator]], potentially capable of taking any animal within its range, including other predators.<ref name=\"dinosaurcorporation1\">[http://www.dinosaurcorporation.com/caimanskull.html Black Caiman, Black Caiman Skull]. Dinosaurcorporation.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-23.</ref> Few ecological studies have been carried out on the species, but the black caiman has its own [[ecological niche]] that enables coexistence without too much competition. As the largest predator in the ecosystem, it may also be a [[keystone species]], playing an important role of maintaining the structure of the ecosystem.<ref name=\"umich1\"/> Reproduction takes place in the [[dry season]]. Females build a nest mound with an egg chamber, protecting the eggs from predators. Hatchlings form groups called pods, guarded by the presence of the female. These pods may contain individuals from other nests. Once common, it was hunted to near extinction primarily for its commercially valuable hide. It is now making a comeback, listed as [[Conservation Dependent]].<ref name=IUCN/> Overall a little-known species, it was not researched in any detail until the 1980s, when the leather-trade had already taken its toll.<ref name=Crocodilian>[http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_mnig.htm Crocodilian Species \u2013 Black Caiman ''(Melanosuchus niger'')].

The skin coloration helps with [[camouflage]] during its [[nocturnal]] hunts, but may also help absorb heat (see ''[[thermoregulation]]''). The lower jaw has grey banding (brown in older animals), and pale yellow or white bands are present across the flanks of the body, although these are much more prominent in juveniles. This banding fades only gradually as the animal matures. The bony ridge extending from above the eyes down the snout, as seen in other caiman, is present. The eyes are large, as befits its largely nocturnal activity, and brown in colour. Mothers on guard near their nests are tormented by blood-sucking flies that gather around their vulnerable eyes, leaving them bloodshot.\n\nThe black caiman is structurally dissimilar to other caiman species, particularly in the shape of the skull. Compared to other caimans, it has distinctly larger eyes. Although the snout is relatively narrow, the skull (given the species' considerably larger size) is much larger overall than other caimans. Black caimans are relatively more robust than other crocodilians of comparable length. There appears to be varying skull morphology in this species depending on the age and particular individual animal, which is not uncommon in other modern crocodilians, and by gender, with adult males typically having much more massive skulls relative to their size than like-age females. Due to the differences, males have a stronger bite force and likely exploit a different, and larger, prey base than females.<ref>Foth, C., Bona, P., & Desojo, J. B. (2015).

Similar to other large crocodilians, black caimans have even been observed catching and eating smaller species, such as the [[spectacled caiman]] and sometimes [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalizing]] smaller individuals of their own kind. Hatchlings mostly eat small fish, frogs, and invertebrates such as crustaceans and insects, but with time and size graduate to eating larger [[fish]], including [[piranha]]s, [[catfish]], and [[perch]], which remain a significant food source for all black caimans. Dietary studies have focused on young caimans (due both to their often being more common than large adults and to their being easier to handle), the largest specimen examined for stomach contents in one study being only {{convert|1.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} notably under sexually mature size, which is at a minimum {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in smaller females.

They lay up to 65 eggs (though usually somewhere between 30 and 60), which hatch in about six weeks, at the beginning of the wet season, when newly flooded marshes provide ideal habitat for the juveniles once hatched.<ref name= Crocodilian/> The eggs are quite large, averaging {{convert|144|g|oz|abbr=on}} in weight.<ref name= CSG/> Unguarded clutches (when the mother goes off to hunt) are readily devoured by a wide array of animals, regularly including mammals such as [[South American coati]]s (''Nasua nasua'') or large rodents, egg-preying snakes and birds such as [[heron]]s and [[New World vulture|vultures]]. Occasionally predators are caught and killed by the mother caiman.<ref name= Crocodilian/> Hatching is said to occur between 42 and 90 days after the eggs are laid.<ref name= Crocodilian/> It is well documented that, as with other crocodilians, caimans frequently move their young from the nest in their mouths after hatching (whence the erroneous belief that they eat their young), and transport them to a safe pool. The mother will assist chirping, unhatched young to break out of the leathery eggs, by delicately breaking the eggs between her teeth. She will try to look after her young for several months but the baby caimans are largely independent and most do not survive to maturity. Baby black caimans are subject to predation even more regularly after they hatch, facing many of the same [[Mesopredator release hypothesis|mesopredators]], as well any other crocodilian (including those of their own species), large snake or large, carnivorous [[fish]] that they encounter. Predation is so common that black caimans count on their young to survive via safety in numbers.<ref name= Crocodilian/> The female black caiman only breeds once every 2 to 3 years.\n\n===Interspecific predatory relationships===\nMany predators, including various fish, mammal, reptile and even amphibian species, feed on caiman eggs and hatchlings. The black caiman shares its habitat with at least 3 other semi-amphibious animals considered apex predators and is usually able to co-exist with them by focusing on different prey and micro-habitats. These are [[giant otter]]s which are social and are obligate aquatic foragers and piscivorans, [[green anaconda]]s which are slow, infrequent feeders mostly on medium-sized mammals and reptiles and [[jaguar]]s, which are the most terrestrial of these and focus their diet mainly on relatively larger mammals and reptiles. Black caimans eat more or less all the same prey as the other species. They are possibly the most opportunistic but, despite being the largest predator of the area, can metabolically live off of their food longer and thus may not need to hunt as frequently. Usually, each predator avoids encounters with adults of the others but battles, which can be lost by nearly any side, may rarely occur. More so than even otters and anaconda, jaguars and black caiman arguably sit atop this food chain. Once the black caiman attains a length of a few feet, it has few natural predators. Large [[Eunectes|anacondas]] may take an occasional young caiman of this species. The [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), being a known predator of all other caiman species, is the only primary predatory threat to black caimans, with several records of predation on young black caimans and eggs and a single reported instance of an adult male black caiman, measuring {{convert|3.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, having fallen prey to a large jaguar. However, very large black caimans, {{convert|4.3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} or more in length, have no natural predators, as is true of other similarly-sized crocodilian species given the size, weight, thick hide and immense strength and may, in rare instances, themselves prey upon jaguars.<ref name= Bioone/><ref>Somaweera, R., Brien, M., & Shine, R.

Cherrytree Books.</ref>\n\n==Conservation status and threats==\nHumans hunt black caimans for leather or meat. This species was classified as Endangered in the 1970s due to the high demand for its well-marked skin. The trade in black caiman leather peaked from the 1950s to 1970s, when the smaller but much more common [[spectacled caiman]] (''Caiman crocodilus'') became the more commonly hunted species. Local people still trade black caiman skins and meat today at a small scale but the species has rebounded overall from the overhunting in the past.<ref name= CSG/> That black caimans lay, on average, around 40 eggs has helped them recover to some degree.<ref name= CSG/> Perhaps an equal continuing threat is habitat destruction, since development and clear-cutting is now epidemic in South America. Spectacled caimans have now filled the niche of crocodilian predator of fish in many areas. Due to their greater numbers and faster reproductive abilities, the Spectacled populations are locally outcompeting black caimans, although the larger species dominates in a one-on-one basis.<ref name= Crocodilian/> Persistent management is needed to control caiman-hunting and is quite difficult to enforce effectively.<ref name= CSG/> After the depletion of the black caiman population, [[piranha]]s and [[capybara]]s, having lost perhaps their primary predator, reached unnaturally high numbers. This has, in turn, led to increased agricultural and livestock losses.<ref name= Crocodilian/>\n\nCompounding the conservation issues it faces, this species occasionally preys on humans.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2010/08/biologa-atacada-por-jacare-na-amazonia-luta-pela-preservacao-da-especie.html ''Jornal Hoje \u2013 Bi\u00f3loga atacada por jacar\u00e9 na Amaz\u00f4nia luta pela preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie''].

In some individuals, the dark coloration can appear almost black. It has grey to brown banding on the lower jaw.

The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is quite different from other [[caiman]]s but the [[bony ridge]] that occurs in other caimans is present. The head is large and heavy, an advantage in catching larger prey.\n\nThe black caiman is the largest predator in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] [[ecosystem]], preying on a variety of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.<ref name=\"umich1\"/> It is a [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]] and [[apex predator]], potentially capable of taking any animal within its range, including other predators.<ref name=\"dinosaurcorporation1\">[http://www.dinosaurcorporation.com/caimanskull.html Black Caiman, Black Caiman Skull].

As the largest predator in the ecosystem, it may also be a [[keystone species]], playing an important role of maintaining the structure of the ecosystem.<ref name=\"umich1\"/> Reproduction takes place in the [[dry season]]. Females build a nest mound with an egg chamber, protecting the eggs from predators. Hatchlings form groups called pods, guarded by the presence of the female. These pods may contain individuals from other nests. Once common, it was hunted to near extinction primarily for its commercially valuable hide. It is now making a comeback, listed as [[Conservation Dependent]].<ref name=IUCN/> Overall a little-known species, it was not researched in any detail until the 1980s, when the leather-trade had already taken its toll.<ref name=Crocodilian>[http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_mnig.htm Crocodilian Species \u2013 Black Caiman ''(Melanosuchus niger'')].

The skin coloration helps with [[camouflage]] during its [[nocturnal]] hunts, but may also help absorb heat (see ''[[thermoregulation]]''). The lower jaw has grey banding (brown in older animals), and pale yellow or white bands are present across the flanks of the body, although these are much more prominent in juveniles. This banding fades only gradually as the animal matures. The bony ridge extending from above the eyes down the snout, as seen in other caiman, is present. The eyes are large, as befits its largely nocturnal activity, and brown in colour. Mothers on guard near their nests are tormented by blood-sucking flies that gather around their vulnerable eyes, leaving them bloodshot.\n\nThe black caiman is structurally dissimilar to other caiman species, particularly in the shape of the skull. Compared to other caimans, it has distinctly larger eyes. Although the snout is relatively narrow, the skull (given the species' considerably larger size) is much larger overall than other caimans. Black caimans are relatively more robust than other crocodilians of comparable length. There appears to be varying skull morphology in this species depending on the age and particular individual animal, which is not uncommon in other modern crocodilians, and by gender, with adult males typically having much more massive skulls relative to their size than like-age females. Due to the differences, males have a stronger bite force and likely exploit a different, and larger, prey base than females.<ref>Foth, C., Bona, P., & Desojo, J. B. (2015).

Large prey that cannot be swallowed whole are often stored so the flesh will rot enough to allow the caiman to take bites out of the flesh.\n[[Image:Melanosuchus niger RDS Uacari.jpg|thumb|Adult]]\n\n===Reproduction===\nAt the end of the dry season, females build a [[nest]] of [[soil]] and vegetation, which is about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} across and {{convert|0.75|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide. They lay up to 65 eggs (though usually somewhere between 30 and 60), which hatch in about six weeks, at the beginning of the wet season, when newly flooded marshes provide ideal habitat for the juveniles once hatched.<ref name= Crocodilian/> The eggs are quite large, averaging {{convert|144|g|oz|abbr=on}} in weight.<ref name= CSG/> Unguarded clutches (when the mother goes off to hunt) are readily devoured by a wide array of animals, regularly including mammals such as [[South American coati]]s (''Nasua nasua'') or large rodents, egg-preying snakes and birds such as [[heron]]s and [[New World vulture|vultures]]. Occasionally predators are caught and killed by the mother caiman.<ref name= Crocodilian/> Hatching is said to occur between 42 and 90 days after the eggs are laid.<ref name= Crocodilian/> It is well documented that, as with other crocodilians, caimans frequently move their young from the nest in their mouths after hatching (whence the erroneous belief that they eat their young), and transport them to a safe pool. The mother will assist chirping, unhatched young to break out of the leathery eggs, by delicately breaking the eggs between her teeth. She will try to look after her young for several months but the baby caimans are largely independent and most do not survive to maturity. Baby black caimans are subject to predation even more regularly after they hatch, facing many of the same [[Mesopredator release hypothesis|mesopredators]], as well any other crocodilian (including those of their own species), large snake or large, carnivorous [[fish]] that they encounter. Predation is so common that black caimans count on their young to survive via safety in numbers.<ref name= Crocodilian/> The female black caiman only breeds once every 2 to 3 years.\n\n===Interspecific predatory relationships===\nMany predators, including various fish, mammal, reptile and even amphibian species, feed on caiman eggs and hatchlings. The black caiman shares its habitat with at least 3 other semi-amphibious animals considered apex predators and is usually able to co-exist with them by focusing on different prey and micro-habitats. These are [[giant otter]]s which are social and are obligate aquatic foragers and piscivorans, [[green anaconda]]s which are slow, infrequent feeders mostly on medium-sized mammals and reptiles and [[jaguar]]s, which are the most terrestrial of these and focus their diet mainly on relatively larger mammals and reptiles. Black caimans eat more or less all the same prey as the other species. They are possibly the most opportunistic but, despite being the largest predator of the area, can metabolically live off of their food longer and thus may not need to hunt as frequently. Usually, each predator avoids encounters with adults of the others but battles, which can be lost by nearly any side, may rarely occur. More so than even otters and anaconda, jaguars and black caiman arguably sit atop this food chain. Once the black caiman attains a length of a few feet, it has few natural predators. Large [[Eunectes|anacondas]] may take an occasional young caiman of this species. The [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), being a known predator of all other caiman species, is the only primary predatory threat to black caimans, with several records of predation on young black caimans and eggs and a single reported instance of an adult male black caiman, measuring {{convert|3.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, having fallen prey to a large jaguar. However, very large black caimans, {{convert|4.3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} or more in length, have no natural predators, as is true of other similarly-sized crocodilian species given the size, weight, thick hide and immense strength and may, in rare instances, themselves prey upon jaguars.<ref name= Bioone/><ref>Somaweera, R., Brien, M., & Shine, R.

This species was classified as Endangered in the 1970s due to the high demand for its well-marked skin. The trade in black caiman leather peaked from the 1950s to 1970s, when the smaller but much more common [[spectacled caiman]] (''Caiman crocodilus'') became the more commonly hunted species. Local people still trade black caiman skins and meat today at a small scale but the species has rebounded overall from the overhunting in the past.<ref name= CSG/> That black caimans lay, on average, around 40 eggs has helped them recover to some degree.<ref name= CSG/> Perhaps an equal continuing threat is habitat destruction, since development and clear-cutting is now epidemic in South America. Spectacled caimans have now filled the niche of crocodilian predator of fish in many areas. Due to their greater numbers and faster reproductive abilities, the Spectacled populations are locally outcompeting black caimans, although the larger species dominates in a one-on-one basis.<ref name= Crocodilian/> Persistent management is needed to control caiman-hunting and is quite difficult to enforce effectively.<ref name= CSG/> After the depletion of the black caiman population, [[piranha]]s and [[capybara]]s, having lost perhaps their primary predator, reached unnaturally high numbers. This has, in turn, led to increased agricultural and livestock losses.<ref name= Crocodilian/>\n\nCompounding the conservation issues it faces, this species occasionally preys on humans.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2010/08/biologa-atacada-por-jacare-na-amazonia-luta-pela-preservacao-da-especie.html ''Jornal Hoje \u2013 Bi\u00f3loga atacada por jacar\u00e9 na Amaz\u00f4nia luta pela preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie''].
