Changes to the scenes included the replacement of many characters with zombies. The ride reopened with the new laser quest element at the start of the 2003 season.\n\nThe Swamp finale is also the only scene to have been removed in its entirety in the 2003 refurbishment. It was replaced by a scene set in a basement, with moving zombie targets. The surviving original scenes are now significantly changed from their original design.\n\nThe ride received a new zoned soundtrack in 2018, along with altered UV strobe lighting and repaired props. The Big Spider now appears from the darkness instead of being fully lit and the Splitface no longer has a generic red light. \n\n==Scarefest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nFor the 2008 and 2009 annual Halloween 'Scarefest' events held at Alton Towers, the ride became host to \"Duel: Live!\" This attraction featured live actors situated in different scenes around the ride, to scare riders while in their cars. The laser guns and all the LEDs were switched off, so that riders were not distracted by the shooting and focused on the ride. The music was replaced throughout the ride, with a different, more atmospheric piece used instead of the usual Duel theme.\n\nDuel Live made use of the original outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar to what it was in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.\n\nIn 2008 Scarefest, Duel ran as normal during the morning and afternoon, before switching over to Duel Live after 3:00PM with the standard Duel theme restricted to the finale. It featured approximately four live actors on ride. The format changed for 2009 in which Duel Live ran all day, with about eight different actors on ride. When Alton Towers released details for the 2010 Scarefest event, it was notable that Duel Live was absent from the attractions line-up. Instead, the attraction was renamed \"Skelvin's Haunted Adventure\" for the 2010 event, and it was based around the park's Halloween mascots, particularly the character 'Skelvin'.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.altontowers.com/theme-park/fun-rides/duel/ Duel at the official Alton Towers website]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_71b0KCHoe0 Full recording of The Haunted House in 1992/93]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNE8g8mdn4 Dark Rides documentary with the original designers]\n\n{{coord|52.98897|-1.884314|display=title}}\n\n{{Alton Towers}}\n{{British dark rides}}\n{{John Wardley}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duel (Ride)}}\n[[Category:Haunted attractions (simulated)]]\n[[Category:Dark rides]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides by name]]\n[[Category:Animatronic attractions]]\n[[Category:Alton Towers]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Mack Rides]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Rides designed by John Wardley]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox attraction\n| name                = ''Duel \u2013 The Haunted House Strikes Back''\n| logo                = <!--Use ONLY the filename, not a full [[File:]] link-->\n| logo_width          = <!--Default is 250px-->\n| image               = Duel Facade.JPG\n| imagedimensions     = <!--Default is 250px-->\n| caption             = \n| location            = Alton Towers Resort<!--Must not be linked.-->\n| section             = [[Alton Towers Resort#Gloomy Wood|Gloomy Wood]]<!--Should be linked.-->\n| status              = Open\n| cost                = \n| soft_opened         = \n| opened              = 1992 (as The Haunted House)<br>2003 (as Duel)\n| closed              = \n| previousattraction  =\n| replacement         = <!--If there is an appropriate article, this should be linked.-->\n| coordinates         = <!--Use ONLY if attraction is at one park.

Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

Extensive archaeological evidence shows commerce, agriculture, and hunting at Paquim\u00e9 and [[Cuarenta Casas]] (''Forty Houses'').\n\n[[La Cueva de las Ventanas]] (''The Cave of Windows''), a series of cliff dwellings along an important trade route, and Las Jarillas Cave scrambled along the canyons of the Sierra Madre in Northwestern Chihuahua date between AD 1205 and 1260 and belong to the [[Paquim\u00e9]] culture. Cuarenta Casas is thought to have been a branch settlement from Paquim\u00e9 to protect the trade route from attack. Archaeologists believe the civilization began to decline during the 13th century and by the 15th century the inhabitants of Paquim\u00e9 sought refuge in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] while others are thought to have emigrated north and joined the [[Ancestral Pueblo peoples]]. According to anthropologist current natives tribes ([[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], [[Mayo people|Mayo]], [[Opata people|Opata]], and [[Tarahumara]]) are descendants of the Casas Grandes culture.\n\nDuring the 14th century in the northeastern part of the state nomad tribes by the name of [[Jornado]] hunted [[bison]] along the [[Rio Grande]]; they left numerous rock paintings throughout the northeastern part of the state. When the Spanish explorers reached this area they found their descendants, [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]] and [[Manso Indians|Manso]] tribes. In the southern part of the state, in a region known as [[Aridoamerica]], [[Chichimeca]] people survived by hunting, gathering, and farming between AD 300 and 1300. The Chichimeca are the ancestors of the [[Tepehu\u00e1n people]].\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain}}\nNueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) was the first province of northern [[New Spain]] to be explored and settled by the Spanish. Around 1528, a group of Spaniard explorers, led by [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca|\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], first entered the territory of what is now Chihuahua. The conquest of the territory lasted nearly one century and encountered fierce resistance from the [[Conchos people|Conchos]] tribe, but the desire of the [[Spanish Crown]] to transform the region into a bustling mining center led to a strong strategy to control the area.\n\n[[File:Deza y Ulloa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa]] the founder of [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]]]\nIn 1562 [[Francisco de Ibarra]] headed a personal expedition in search of the mythical cities of [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|C\u00edbola]] and [[Quivira]]; he traveled through the present-day state of Chihuahua. [[Francisco de Ibarra]] is thought to have been the first European to see the ruins of Paquim\u00e9. In 1564 [[Rodrigo de R\u00edo de Loza]], a lieutenant under Francisco de Ibarra, stayed behind after the expedition and found gold at the foot of the mountains of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]; he founded the first Spanish city in the region, [[Santa B\u00e1rbara, Chihuahua|Santa B\u00e1rbara]] in 1567 by bringing 400 European families to the settlement. A few years later in 1569 Franciscan missionaries led by [[Fray Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez]] from the coast of Sinaloa and the state of Durango founded the first mission in the state in Valle de San Bartolom\u00e9 (present-day Valle de Allende). Fray Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez evangelized the native population until 1581. Between 1586 and 1588 an epidemic caused a temporary exodus of the small population in the territory of Nueva Vizcaya.\n\nSanta B\u00e1rbara became the launching place for expeditions into [[New Mexico]] by Spanish conquistadors like [[Antonio de Espejo]], [[Gaspar Casta\u00f1o]], [[Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez de Uma\u00f1a]], [[Francisco Leyba de Bonilla]], and [[Vicente de Zald\u00edvar]]. Several expeditions were led to find a shorter route from Santa B\u00e1rbara to New Mexico. In April 1598, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] found a short route from Santa B\u00e1rbara to New Mexico which came to be called [[El Paso del Norte]] (The Northern Pass). The discovery of El Paso del Norte was important for the expansion of [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]] (The Inner Land Royal Road) to link Spanish settlements in New Mexico to Mexico City; El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated transport of settlers and supplies to New Mexico and [[Camargo, Chihuahua|Camargo]].\n\n[[File:Acueducto Chihuahua - 02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An 18th century colonial aqueduct built in Chihuahua City]]\nIn 1631 [[Juan Rangel de Biezma]] discovered a rich vein of silver and subsequently established San Jos\u00e9 del [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]] near the site. Parral remained an important economic and cultural center for the next 300 years. On December 8, 1659 Fray Garc\u00eda de San Francisco founded the mission of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del R\u00edo del Norte and founded the town El Paso del Norte (present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]) in 1667.\n\nThe Spanish society that developed in the region replaced the sparse population of indigenous peoples. The absence of servants and workers forged the spirit of northern people as self-dependent, creative people that defended their European heritage. In 1680 settlers from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico sought refuge in El Paso del Norte for twelve years after fleeing the attacks from Pueblo tribes, but returned to Santa Fe in 1692 after Diego de Vargas recaptured the city and vicinity. In 1709, [[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa]] founded the state capital [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua City]]; shortly after, the city became the headquarters for the regional mining offices of the Spanish crown known as 'Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cu\u00e9llar' in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cueva Enr\u00edquez]], Duke of Alburquerque and the Marquee of Cu\u00e9llar.\n\n===Mexican War of Independence===\n{{Main|Mexican War of Independence}}\n[[File:ChihHidalgo1.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A mural of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in the [[Government Palace of Chihuahua]] by [[Aar\u00f3n Pi\u00f1a Mora]]]]\nDuring the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato|Dolores]], [[Guanajuato]] on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the \"Grito de Dolores\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Fern\u00e1ndez Tejedo, Isabel |author2=Carmen Nava Nava |year=2001 |chapter=Images of Independence in the Nineteenth Century: The ''Grito de Dolores'', History and Myth |editor=William H.

Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, [[Mexico City]], but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. Hidalgo reached [[Saltillo]], [[Coahuila]] where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco Javier Venegas, marqu\u00e9s de la Reuni\u00f3n y de Nueva Espa\u00f1a|Francisco Venegas]] in return for Hidalgo's surrender.

The military entered as a third party. The elections for the first regular legislature were disputed, and it was not until May 1, 1826, that the body was installed. The liberals gained control and the opposition responded by fomenting a conspiracy. This was promptly stopped with the aid of informers, and more strenuous measures were taken against the conservatives. Extra powers were conferred on the Durango governor, Santiago Baca Ortiz, deputy to the first national congress, and leader of the liberal party.<ref name=\"The History Company\">History Of The North Mexican States And Texas, Vol. II 1801&ndash;1889, San Francisco, The History Company, Publishers, 1889, Chapter 24</ref>\n\n===Gonz\u00e1lez's rebellion===\nOpponents continued to plot against the new government. In March 1827, Lieutenant J.M. Gonz\u00e1lez proclaimed himself comandante general, arrested the governor, and dissolved the legislature. General Parras was sent to suppress the movement. Comandante general J. J. Ayestar\u00e1n was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]]. When elections failed, the government intervened in favor of the [[Yorkino]] party, which had elected [[Vicente Guerrero]] to the presidency.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nBecause of the general instability of the federal government during 1828, the installation of the new legislature did not take place until the middle of the following year. It was quickly dissolved by Governor [[Santiago de Baca Ortiz]], who replaced it with a more pronounced Yorkino type. When Guerrero's liberal administration was overthrown in December, Gaspar de Ochoa aligned with [[Anastasio Bustamante]], and in February 1830, organized an opposition group that arrested the new governor, F. Elorriaga, along with other prominent Yorkinos. He then summoned the legislature, which had been dissolved by Baca. The civil and military authorities were now headed by J. A. Pescador and [[Sim\u00f3n Ochoa]].<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Vicente Guerrero===\nThe general features of the preceding occurrence applied also to Chihuahua, although in a modified form. The first person elected under the new constitution of 1825 was [[Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonzalez]], who being in [[Sonora]], was induced to remain there. [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Arc\u00e9]] took his place as ruler in Chihuahua. In 1829, Gonz\u00e1lez became general commander of Chihuahua, when his term of office on the west coast expired. Arc\u00e9 was less of a [[yorkino]] than his confr\u00e8re of Durango. Although unable to resist the popular demand for the expulsion of the Spaniards, he soon quarreled with the legislature, which declared itself firmly for [[Vicente Guerrero|Guerrero]], and announcing his support of [[Anastasio Bustamante|Bustamante]]'s revolution, he suspended, in March 1830, eight members of that body, the vice-governor, and several other officials, and expelled them from the state. The course thus outlined was followed by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Isidro Madero]], who succeeded in 1830, associated with [[J. J. Calvo]] as general commander, stringent laws being issued against [[secret societies]], which were supposed to be the main spring to the anti-clerical feeling among liberals.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Durango and Bustamante===\nThe anti-clerical feeling was widespread, and [[Durango]] supported the initial reaction against the government at Mexico. In May 1832, [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]], a rising officer, supported the restoration of President [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza|Pedraza]]. On July 20, Governor Elorriaga was reinstated, and Baca along with the legislative minority were brought back to form a new legislature, which met on September 1. Chihuahua showed no desire to imitate the revolutionary movement and Urrea prepared to invade the state. Comandante-general J.J.Calvo threatened to retaliate, and a conflict seemed imminent. The entry of [[General Santa Anna]] into Mexico brought calm, as the leaders waited for clarity.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Santa Anna===\n[[File:Oleo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.PNG|left|thumb|175px|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]]]\nBishop [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Laureano de Zubir\u00eda]] of Durango was banished for resisting the law relating to priests and other encroachments on the church; another joined the western states in a short lived coalition for sustaining the federal system. Chihuahua adopted the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]] in July 1834 while President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] was in power. Because the plan was not enforced, commanding officer, Colonel [[J.I. Guti\u00e9rrez]], declared the term of the legislature and governor expired on September 3.\n\nAt a convention of citizens called to select a new provisional ruler, Guti\u00e9rrez obtained the vote, with [[P. J. Escalante]] for his deputy, and a council to guide the administration.<ref name=\"The History Company\" /> [[General Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] ordered the reinstatement of Mendarozqueta as comandante general. Guti\u00e9rrez yielded, but Escalante refused to surrender office, demonstrations of support ensued, but Escalante yielded when troops were summoned from [[Zacatecas]]. A new election brought a new legislature, and conforming governors. In September 1835 [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] a federalist army officer came into power.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nComandante general Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez, was nominated governor and military command was given to Colonel J.J. Calvo, whose firmness had earned well-merited praise. The state was in the midst of a war with the [[Apache]]s, which became the focus of all their energy and resources. After a review of the situation, Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez declared that the interests of the territory would be best served by uniting the civil and military power, at least while the campaign lasted. He resigned under opposition, but was renominated in 1837.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Chihuahua 1846-1848.svg|thumb|left|200px|Battles of [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Chihuahua]]\nThe state seemed at relative calm compared to the rest of the country due to its close ties to the United States until 1841. In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and steps were taken to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844. Continuing to anticipate a war, the state legislature on July 11, 1846 by decree enlisted 6,000 men to serve along the border; during that time [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] quickly rose to power by portraying zealous anti-American rhetoric. Tr\u00edas took the opportunity to dedicate important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities in preparation to defend the state; he used all the money he received to equip and organize a large volunteer militia. \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas took measures for state self-dependence in regards to state militia due to the diminishing financial support from the federal government.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nThe United States Congress declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846 after only having a few hours to debate. Although President Jos\u00e9 Mariano Paredes' issuance of a manifesto on May 23 is sometimes considered the declaration of war, Mexico officially declared war by Congress on July 7. After the American invasion of New Mexico, Chihuahua sent 12,000 men led by Colonel Vidal to the border to stop the American military advance into the state. The Mexican forces being impatient to confront the American forces passed beyond El Paso del Norte about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north along the Rio Grande. The first battle that Chihuahua fought was the battle of El Bracito; the Mexican forces consisting of 500 cavalry and 70 infantry confronted a force of 1,100\u20131,200 Americans on December 25, 1846. The battle ended badly by the Mexican forces that were then forced to retreat back into the state of Chihuahua. By December 27, 1846, the American forces occupied El Paso del Norte. General Doniphan maintained camp in El Paso del Norte awaiting supplies and artillery which he received in February 1847.\n\nOn February 8, 1847, Doniphan continued his march with 924 men mostly from Missouri; he accompanied a train of 315 wagons of a large commercial caravan heading to the state capital. Meanwhile, the Mexican forces in the state had time to prepare a defense against the Americans. About {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of the capital where two mountain ranges join from east to west is the only pass into the capital; known as Sacramento Pass, this point is now part of present-day [[Chihuahua City]]. The [[Battle of the Sacramento River|Battle of Sacramento]] was the most important battle fought in the state of Chihuahua because it was the sole defense for the state capital. The battle ended quickly because of some devastating defensive errors from the Mexican forces and the ingenious strategic moves by the American forces. After their loss at the Battle of Sacramento, the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated south, leaving the city to American occupation. Almost 300 Mexicans were killed in the battle, as well as almost 300 wounded. The Americans also confiscated large amounts of Mexican supplies and took 400 Mexican soldiers prisoners of war. American forces maintained an occupation of the state capital for the rest of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n[[File:Batalla de Sacramento.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Battle of the Sacramento River]]]]\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Rosales|Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales]] was the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.<ref name=\"Mexican_states\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states.htm#Chihuahua|title=Mexican States A-J|accessdate=January 15, 2011|author=Ben Cahoon|publisher=worldstatesmen.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122103343/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states.htm#Chihuahua|archivedate=January 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the American occupation of the state, the number of Indian attacks was drastically reduced, but in 1848 the attacks resumed to such a degree that the Mexican officials had no choice but to resume military projects to protect Mexican settlements in the state.<ref name=\"The History Company\" /><ref name=\"indi2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seminolenation-indianterritory.org/seminole_in_mexico.htm|title=Seminole in Mexico|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Seminole Nation, I.

After the occupation the people of the state were worried about the potential attack from the hostile indigenous tribes north of the Rio Grande; as a result a decree on July 19, 1848, the state established 18 military colonies along the Rio Grande. The new military colonies were to replace the presidios as population centers to prevent future invasions by indigenous tribes; these policies remained prominent in the state until 1883. Eventually the state replaced the old state security with a state policy to form militias organized with every Mexican in the state capable to serve between the ages of 18 and 55 to fulfill the mandate of having six men defending for every 1000 residents. [[File:Mesilla Chih Outline MaxSize.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Mesilla Valley|La Mesilla]], a large area that was claimed by the state of Chihuahua.]]\n\n=== La Mesilla ===\nThe frontier counties of the state along the border with the United States expected federal protection from the federal government under [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera|Herrera]] and [[Mariano Arista|Arista]], but were soon disappointed by the federal government's decision to deploy military forces to other areas of the country due to internal challenges in the state of [[Jalisco]]. [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] led a rebellion to successfully depose the unpopular conservative Governor Cordero at the end of 1852.\n\nDespite the efforts of strong political forces led by \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas in the state could not stop President Santa Anna from selling [[Mesilla Valley|La Mesilla]] as part of the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on December 30, 1853 for 15 million USD. It was then ratified in the United States on April 25, 1854 and signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]], with final approval action taken by Mexico on June 8, 1854.  The citizens of the area held strong anti-American sentiments and raided American settlers and travelers across the area.\n\n===The Reform War and the French Intervention===\n{{main| Reform War| French Intervention}}\n[[File:PalGobJuarez.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A mural by Pi\u00f1a in the Government Palace, honouring the liberators [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\nThe state united behind the [[Plan of Ayutla]] and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the [[Reform War]] with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General [[Cajen]] briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders [[Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]]. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in ''La Batalla del Gallo''. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]] of Durango and  [[J.E. Mu\u00f1oz]] of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree.  The state elected General [[Luis Terrazas]], a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.[[File:Casa de Juarez - Chihuahua, Chihuahua - 02.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Museo Casa Ju\u00e1rez]], a 19th-century building in downtown Chihuahua city, that served as the ''de facto'' National Palace of Mexico.]]\n\nIn consequence to the Reform War, the federal government was bankrupt and could not pay its foreign debts to Spain, England, and France.  On July 17, 1861, President Ju\u00e1rez decreed a moratorium on payment to foreign debtors for a period of two years. Spain, England, and France did not accept the moratorium by Mexico; they united at the Convention of the Triple Alliance on October 31, 1861 in which they agreed to take possession of several custom stations within Mexico as payment. A delegation of the Triple Alliance arrived in Veracruz in December 1861. President Ju\u00e1rez immediately sent his Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Manuel Doblado]], who is able to reduce the debts through the [[Pacto de Soledad]] (Soledad Pact). General [[Juan Prim]] of Spain persuaded the English delegation to accept the terms of the Pacto de Soledad, but the French delegation refused.\n\nThe liberal political forces maintained strong control over the state government until shortly after the [[French Intervention]] which turned the tables in favor to the conservative forces once again. The intervention had serious repercussions for the state of Chihuahua. President Ju\u00e1rez, in an effort to organize a strong defense against the French, decreed a list of national guard units that every state had to contribute to the Ministry of War and the Navy; Chihuahua was responsible for inducting 2,000 men. Regaining power, Governor [[Luis Terrazas]] assigned the First Battalion of Chihuahua for integration into the national army led by General [[Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega]]; the battalion was deployed to Puebla. After the defeat of the army in Puebla, the Ju\u00e1rez administration was forced to abandon Mexico City; the president retreated further north seeking refuge in the state of Chihuahua.\n\nUnder threat from the conservative forces, Governor Terrazas was deposed, and the state legislature proclaimed martial law in the state in April 1864 and established [[Jes\u00fas Jos\u00e9 Casavantes]] as the new governor. In response, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]] decided to march to Chihuahua with presidential support. Meanwhile, Maximilian von Habsburg, a younger brother of the Emperor of Austria, was proclaimed Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Mexico on April 10, 1864 with the backing of Napoleon III and a group of Mexican conservatives. Before President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] was forced to flee, Congress granted him an emergency extension of his presidency, which would go into effect in 1865 when his term expired, and last until 1867. At the same time, the state liberals and conservatives compromised to allow the popular [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] take the governorship; by this time the French forces had taken control over the central portions of the country and were making preparations to invade the northern states.\n\n[[File:Chihuahua 1862-1867-en.svg|300px|left|thumb|Overview of military actions]]\nThe French forces tried to subdue and capture the liberal government based in [[Saltillo]]. On September 21, 1864, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni and Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega lost against the French forces at the Battle of Estanzuelas; the supreme government led by President Ju\u00e1rez was forced to evacuate the city of [[Saltillo]] and relocate to Chihuahua.  Ju\u00e1rez stopped in [[Ciudad Jim\u00e9nez]],  [[Valle de Allende]], and [[Parral, Chihuahua|Hidalgo de Parral]], in turn.  He decreed Parral the capital of Mexico from October 2\u20135, 1864.<ref>[http://inegi.gob.mx/geo/default.aspx Secci\u00f3n en INEGI Estado Chihuahua, municipio Hidalgo del Parral, localidad 0001 Enero 7 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824154827/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/geo/default.aspx |date=August 24, 2007 }}</ref> Perceiving the threat from the advancing French forces, the president continued his evacuation through [[Camargo (Chihuahua)|Santa Rosal\u00eda de Camargo]], [[Santa Cruz de Rosales]], and finally [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]. On October 12, 1864, the people of the state gave President Ju\u00e1rez an overwhelmingly supportive reception, led by Governor \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas.  On October 15, 1864 the city of Chihuahua was declared the temporary capital of Mexico.\n\nAfter running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango, General [[Agust\u00edn Enrique Brincourt]] made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua. On July 8, 1865 Brincourt crossed the [[Nazas River]] in northern Durango, heading toward Chihuahua. On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of R\u00edo Florido into Ciudad Jim\u00e9nez; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral. Brincourt continued through Santa Rosal\u00eda de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. President Ju\u00e1rez remained in the state capital until August 5, 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte (present-day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city. On the same day, the President named General [[Manuel Ojinaga]] the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces. Meanwhile, General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. At the Battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces. On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital.  Brincourt designated [[Tom\u00e1s Zuloaga]] as Prefect of Chihuahua.<ref name=\"MEXHIS\">{{cite book\n|last=Riva Palacios\n|first=Vicente\n|title= Revoluci\u00f3n :  M\u00e9xico \u00e1 trav\u00e9s de los siglos: historia general y completa del desenvolvimiento social, pol\u00edtico, religioso, militar, art\u00edstico, cient\u00edfico y literario de M\u00e9xico desde a antig\u00fcedad m\u00e1s remota hasta la \u00e9poca actual\n|year=1940\n|publisher= University of California Libraries (G.

General [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]] ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City. General Brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state, but his request was denied.  After the death of General Ojinaga, the Republican government declared General Villagran in charge of the fight against the Imperial forces. The French left the state on October 29, 1865. President Ju\u00e1rez returned to Chihuahua City on November 20, 1865 and remained in the city until December 9, 1865 when he returned to El Paso del Norte. Shortly after the president left Chihuahua City, [[Luis Terrazas|Terrazas]] was restored as governor of the state on December 11, 1865.\n\nMaximilian was deeply dissatisfied with General Bazaine's decision to abandon the state capital of Chihuahua and immediately ordered [[Agust\u00edn B. Billaut]] to recapture the city. On December 11, 1865, Billaut with a force of 500 men took control of the city. By January 31, 1866 Billaut was ordered to leave Chihuahua, but he left behind 500 men to maintain control. At the zenith of their power, the imperialist forces controlled all but four states in Mexico; the only states to maintain strong opposition to the French were: Guerrero, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California.<ref name=\"Resistance_states\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://mexicanhistory.org/French.htm\n |title       = French intervention and the Second Mexican Empire 1864&ndash;1867\n |accessdate  = January 16, 2011\n |publisher   = MexicanHistory.org\n |location    = MexicanHistory.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081800/http://mexicanhistory.org/French.htm\n |archivedate = July 27, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ChihuahuaZocalo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Plaza de Armas and the [[Cathedral of Chihuahua|Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla and St Francis of Assisi]]]]President Ju\u00e1rez once again based his government in the state of Chihuahua and it served as the center for the resistance against the French invasion throughout Mexico. On March 25, 1866, a battle ensued in the Plaza de Armas in the center of Chihuahua City between the French imperial forces that were guarding the plaza and the Republican forces led by General Terrazas. Being completely caught off guard, the French imperial forces sought refuge by bunkering themselves in the [[Cathedral of Chihuahua|Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla, and St Fancis of Assisi]] and made it almost impossible to penetrate their defenses. General Terrazas then decided to fire a heavy artillery barrage with 8&nbsp;kg cannonballs. The first cannon fired hit a bell in the tower of the church, instantly breaking it in half; soon after, 200 men of the imperial army forces surrendered. The republican forces had recovered control over the state capital. The bell in the church was declared a historical monument and can be seen today in the Cathedral. By April 1866, the state government had established a vital trading route from Chihuahua City to San Antonio, Texas; the government began to replenish their supplies and reinforce their fight against the Imperial forces.\n\nGeneral Aguirre moved to the deserts of the southeastern portion of the state and defeated the French forces in Parral, led by Colonel Cottret. By the middle of 1866, the state of Chihuahua was declared free of enemy control; Parral was the last French stronghold within the state.  On June 17, 1866, President Ju\u00e1rez arrived in Chihuahua City and remained in the capital until December 10, 1866. During his two years in the state of Chihuahua, President Ju\u00e1rez passed ordinances regarding the rights of adjudication of property and nationalized the property of the clergy. The distance of the French forces and their allies allowed the Ministry of War, led by General Negrete, to reorganize the state's national guard into the Patriotic Battalion of Chihuahua, which was deployed to fight in the battle of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] against the French. After a series of major defeats and an escalating threat from Prussia, France began pulling troops out of Mexico in late 1866. Disillusioned with the liberal political views of Maximilian, the Mexican conservatives abandoned him, and in 1867 the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated. Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court; despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence. Maximilian was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.\n\n===Ju\u00e1rez Government===\n[[File:Monumento a Benito Juarez Cd Juarez.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Monument to Benito Ju\u00e1rez in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua]]\nPresident Benito Ju\u00e1rez was re-elected in the general election of 1867 in which he received strong liberal support, especially in Chihuahua. Luis Terrazas was confirmed by the people of Chihuahua to be governor of the state. But soon after the election, President Ju\u00e1rez had another crisis on his hands; the Ju\u00e1rez administration was suspected to be involved in the assassination of the military chief Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni executed by General Canto in August 1868. General Canto turned himself over to [[Donato Guerra]]. Canto was sentenced to death, but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment. The sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government. In response, the Ju\u00e1rez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights, but the governor of Chihuahua did not support this action. Hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of 1871 which was perceived to be fraudulent. A new popular leader arose among the rebels, Porfirio D\u00edaz. The federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in Durango an Chihuahua. On July 18, 1872, President Ju\u00e1rez died from a heart attack; soon after, many of his supporters ceased the fighting. Peace returned to Chihuahua and the new government was led by Governor Antonio Ochoa (formerly a co-owner of the [[Batopilas, Chihuahua|Batopilas]] silver mines) in 1873 after Luis Terrazas finished his term in 1872.\n\nBut the peace in the state did not last long, the elections of 1875 caused new hostilities. \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas led a new movement against the government in June 1875 and maintained control over the government until September 18, 1875 when [[Donato Guerra]] the orchestrator of the Revolution of the North was captured.  Donato Guerra was assassinated in a suburb of Chihuahua City where he was incarcerated for conspiring with  \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas. During October 1875 several locations were controlled by rebel forces, but the government finally regained control on November 25, 1875.\n\n===Porfiriato===\n[[File:Porfirio Diaz in uniform.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Porfirio D\u00edaz in military uniform]]After the death of the president Benito Ju\u00e1rez in 1872, the first magistracy of the country was occupied by the vice-president Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada, who called for new elections. Two candidates were registered; Lerdo de Tejada and General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], one of the heroes of the [[Battle of Puebla]] which had taken place on May 5, 1862. Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio D\u00edaz rebelled against President Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada. The [[Plan of Tuxtepec]] defended the \"No Re-election\" principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio D\u00edaz; Governor [[Antonio Ochoa]] was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio D\u00edaz then helped Tr\u00edas regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio D\u00edaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877.\nDuring the first years of the [[Porfiriato]] (Porfirio D\u00edaz Era), the D\u00edaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte. [[File:PalAlvarado.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Palacio de Alvarado is the house of [[Pedro Alvarado Torres]], one of the richest silver barons of Mexico during the Porfiriato.]]The officials in Mexico City reduced the price of corn from six cents to two cents a pound. The northern portion of the state continued to decline economically which led to another revolt led by G. Casavantes in August 1879; Governor Tr\u00edas was accused of misappropriation of funds and inefficient administration of the state. Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing Governor Tr\u00edas to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Trevi\u00f1o; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Tr\u00edas. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and water rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled. Despite the difficulties at the beginning, D\u00edaz was able to secure and stabilize the state, which earned the confidence and support of the people.\nDuring the 1880s, the D\u00edaz administration consolidated several government agencies throughout Mexico to control credit and currency by the creation of the Institution of Credit and Currency. Because D\u00edaz had created such an effective centralized government, he was able to concentrate decision making and maintain control over the economic instability.<ref name=\"skidmore\">{{cite book\n|last=Skidmore\n|first=Thomas\n|author2=Peter H.

During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The D\u00edaz administration helped Governor [[Luis Terrazas]] by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad J\u00faarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cities of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels. By the end of the Terrazas term, the state experienced an increase in commerce, mining, and banking. When the banks were nationalized, Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico.\n\nUnder Governor Miguel Ahumada, the education system in the state was unified and brought under tighter control by the state government, and the metric system was standardized throughout the state to replace the colonial system of weights and measures. On September 16, 1897, the Civilian Hospital of Chihuahua was inaugurated in Chihuahua City and became known among the best in the country. In 1901 the Heroes Theater (Teatro de los H\u00e9roes) opened in Chihuahua City. On August 18, 1904, Governor Terrazas was replaced by Governor Enrique C. Creel. From 1907 to 1911, the Creel administration succeeded in advancing the state's legal system, modernizing the mining industry, and raising public education standards. In 1908 the Chihuahuan State Penitentiary was built, and the construction on the first large scale dam project was initiated on the Chuviscar River. During the same time, the streets of Chihuahua City were paved and numerous monuments were built in Chihuahua City and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\n\n===Mexican Revolution===\n[[File:Angel chihuahua.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|The government palace built during the early 20th century now a museum.]]\nD\u00edaz created an effective centralized government that helped concentrate wealth and political power among the elite upper class, mostly [[Criollo people|criollo]]. The economy was characterized by the construction of factories, roads, dams, and better farms. The D\u00edaz administration passed new land laws that virtually unraveled all the rights previously recognized and the land reforms passed by President Benito Ju\u00e1rez. No peasant or farmer could claim the land he occupied without formal legal title.\n\n[[File:Quinta Carolina Main House.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Quinta Carolina is an hacienda owned by the Terrazas family.]]\nA handful of families owned large estates (known as [[hacienda]]s) and controlled the greater part of the land across the state while the vast majority of Chihuahuans were landless. The state economy was largely defined by ranching and mining. At the expense of the [[working class]], the D\u00edaz administration promoted economic growth by encouraging investment from foreign companies from the United Kingdom, France, [[Imperial Germany]] and the United States.  The [[proletariat]] was often exploited, and found no legal protection or political recourse to redress injustices.<ref>{{cite book | title = The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 15th Edition | article = Porfirio D\u00edaz | year = 1993 | pages = 70}}</ref>\n\nDespite the internal stability (known as the ''paz porfiriana''), modernization, and economic growth in Mexico during the Porfiriato from 1876 to 1910, many across the state became deeply dissatisfied with the political system.  When D\u00edaz first ran for office, he committed to a strict \u201cNo Re-election\u201d policy in which he disqualified himself to serve consecutive terms. Eventually backtracking on many of his initial political positions D\u00edaz became a de facto dictator.  D\u00edaz became increasingly unpopular due to brutal suppression of political dissidents by using the [[Rurales]] and manipulating the elections to solidify his political machine. The working class was frustrated with the D\u00edaz regime due to the corruption of the political system that had increased the inequality between the rich and poor.  The peasants felt disenfranchised by the policies that promoted the unfair distribution of land where 95% of the land was owned by the top 5%.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crow | first = John A. | title = The Epic of Latin America | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1992 | location = Berkeley, CA | pages = [https://archive.org/details/epicoflatinameri00crow/page/673 673] | isbn = 0-520-07723-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/epicoflatinameri00crow/page/673 }}</ref>\n\nThe end of the ''Porfiriato'' came in 1910 with the beginning of the Mexican Revolution.

Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] with D\u00edaz. It required that D\u00edaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the United States and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called \"Orozquistas\"\u2014also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")\u2014after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions. The rural working class, which had supported Madero, now took up arms against him in support of Orozco.\n\nIn March 1912, in Chihuahua, Gen. Pascual Orozco revolted. Immediately President Francisco Madero commanded Gen. Victoriano Huerta of the Federal Army, to put down the Orozco revolt. The governor of Chihuahua mobilized the state militia led by Colonel Pancho Villa to supplement General Huerta. By June, Villa notified Huerta that the Orozco revolt had been put down and that the militia would consider themselves no longer under Huerta's command and would depart. Huerta became furious and ordered that Villa be executed. Ra\u00fal Madero, Madero's brother, intervened to save Villa's life.

Soon after the assassination of President Madero, Carranza returned to Mexico to fight Huerta, but with only a handful of comrades. However, by 1913 his forces had swelled into an army of thousands, called the [[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]] (Northern Division). Villa and his army, along with [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], united with Carranza to fight against Huerta. In March 1914 Carranza traveled to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which served as rebellion's capital for the remainder of the struggle with Huerta. In April 1914 U.S. opposition to Huerta had reached its peak, blockading the regime's ability to resupply from abroad. Carranza trying to keep his nationalistic credentials threatened war with the United States.

After Carranza took control in 1914, Villa and other revolutionaries who opposed him met at what was called the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]]. The convention deposed Carranza in favor of [[Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez]]. In the winter of 1914 Villa's and Zapata's troops entered and occupied Mexico City. Villa was forced from the city in early 1915 and attacked the forces of Gen. Obreg\u00f3n at the [[Battle of Celaya]] and was badly defeated in the bloodiest battle of the revolution, with thousands dead. With the defeat of Villa, Carranza seized power. A short time later the United States recognized Carranza as president of Mexico. Even though Villa's forces were badly depleted by his loss at Celaya, he continued his fight against the Carranza government. Finally, in 1920, Obreg\u00f3n\u2014who had defeated him at Celaya\u2014finally reached an agreement with Villa end his rebellion.\n\nPublic opinion pressured the U.S. government to bring Villa to justice for the raid on [[Columbus, New Mexico]]; U.S. President Wilson sent Gen. [[John J.

After nearly a year of pursuing Villa, American forces returned to the United States. The American intervention had been limited to the western sierras of Chihuahua. Villa had the advantage of intimately knowing the inhospitable terrain of the Sonoran Desert and the almost impassable Sierra Madre mountains and always managed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers.

The area is landlocked by the states of [[Sonora]] to the west, [[Sinaloa]] to the south-west, [[Durango]] to the south, and [[Coahuila]] to the east, and by the U.S. states of [[Texas]] to the northeast and [[New Mexico]] to the north. The state is made up of three geologic regions: Mountains, Plains-Valleys, and Desert, which occur in large bands from west to east. Because of the different geologic regions there are contrasting climates and ecosystems.\n\n[[File:CERRO DE MOHINORA.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Cerro Mohinora]] is the highest point in Chihuahua]]\nThe main mountain range in the state is the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] reaching a maximum altitude of 10,826&nbsp;ft (3,300&nbsp;m) known as [[Cerro Mohinora]]. Mountains account for one third of the state's surface area which include large coniferous forests. The climate in the mountainous regions varies. Chihuahua has more forests than any other state in Mexico making the area a bountiful source of wood; the mountainous areas are rich in minerals important to Mexico's mining industry. Precipitation and temperature in the mountainous areas depends on the elevation. Between the months of November and March snow storms are possible in the lower elevations and are frequent in the higher elevations. There are several watersheds located in the Sierra Madre Occidental all of the water that flows through the state; most of the rivers finally empty into the [[R\u00edo Grande]]. Temperatures in some canyons in the state reach over {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the summer while the same areas rarely drop below {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the winter. Microclimates found in the heart of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state could be considered tropical, and wild tropical plants have been found in some canyons.  ''La Barranca del Cobre'', or [[Copper Canyon]], a spectacular canyon system larger and deeper than the [[Grand Canyon]]; the canyon also contains Mexico's two tallest waterfalls: [[Basaseachic Falls]] and [[Piedra Volada]]. There are two national parks found in the mountainous area of the state: [[Cumbres de Majalca National Park]] and [[Basaseachic Falls National Park]].\n\n[[File:Satellite Chihuahua.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of the state of Chihuahua shows the varying terrain from the green alpine mountains in the southwest, to the steppe highlands in the center, to the desert in the east.]]\n[[File:Cascada Basaseachi.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Basaseachic Falls]] in [[Copper Canyon]].]]\nThe plains at the foot of the Sierra Madre Occidental is an elongated mesa known as [[Altiplanicie Mexicana]] that exhibits a steppe climate and serves as a transition zone from the mountain climate in the western part of the state to the desert climate in the eastern side of the state. The steppe zone accounts for a third of the state's area, and it experiences pronounced dry and wet seasons. The pronounced rainy season in the steppe is usually observed in the months of July, August, and September. The steppe also encounters extreme temperatures that often reach over {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the winter. The steppe zone is an important agriculture zone due to an extensive development of canals exploiting several rivers that flow down from the mountains. The steppe zone is the most populated area of the state.\n\nThe most important river in the state is [[R\u00edo Conchos]] which is the largest tributary to the [[R\u00edo Grande]] from the Mexican side; the river descends from the zenith of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the southwest part of the state and winds through the center of the state where the water is exploited in the steppe zone and it eventually empties into the R\u00edo Grande in the small desert town of [[Ojinaga]].\n\nThe desert zone also accounts for about a third of the state's surface area. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] is an international biome that also extends into the neighboring Mexican state of [[Coahuila]] and into the U.S. states of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]. The desert zone is mainly of flat topography with some small mountain ranges that run north to south. The desert in the state varies slightly with a small variant in climate. The lower elevations of the desert zone are found in the north along the Rio Grande which experience hotter temperatures in the summer and winter while the southern portion of the desert zone experiences cooler temperatures due to its higher elevation. The Samalayuca dunes cover an area of about 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; it is an impressive site of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] and is a protected area by the state due to unique species of plants and animals.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Namurachi Canyon.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Nam\u00farachi]] is in the semi-arid zone.]]\nThe climate in the state depends mainly in the elevation of the terrain. According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] the state has five major climate zones. The [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] dominates the western part of the state; there are two main climates in this area:  [[Oceanic climate|Subtropical Highland]] (Cfb) and [[Humid Subtropical]] (Cwa). There are some microclimates in the state due to the varying topology mostly found in the western side of the state. The two best known microclimates are: [[Tropical savanna climate]] (Aw) in deep canyons located in the extreme southern part of the state; [[Continental Mediterranean climate]] (Dsb) in the extremely high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Satellite image to the right shows the vegetation is much greener in the west because of the cooler temperatures and larger amounts of precipitation as compared to the rest of the state.\n\nIn the far eastern part of the state the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] dominates due to low precipitation and extremely high temperatures; some areas of the eastern part of the state are so dry no vegetation is found like the [[Samalayuca Dune Fields|Sand Dunes of Samalayuca]]. There are two distinctive climate zones found in the eastern part of the state: Hot Desert (BWh) and Cool Desert (BWk) which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; this zone is the [[Steppe]] characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones.[[File:Climate Zones of Chihuahua.png|thumb|left|200px|'''''K\u00f6ppen Climate Zones'''''\n{|\n|- valign=top |\n|\n{{legend|#1C4827|[[Oceanic climate|Subtropical Highland Cfb]]}}\n{{legend|#296D3C|[[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical Cwa]]}}\n{{legend|#AAD699|[[Semi-arid climate|Steppe BSk]]}}\n{{legend|#D7BF99|[[Desert climate|Cool Desert BWk]]}}\n{{legend|#F4F3B2|[[Desert climate|Hot Desert BWh]]}}\n| width=6 |\n|}\n]]\n\n[[File:Chihuahua Steppe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Altiplanicie Mexicana]] during the monsoon season.]]\n[[File:Miviajeachihuahua.JPG|thumbnail|200px|[[Chihuahua white pine]]s amid snow.]]\n[[File:Dunas samalayuca.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Samalayuca Dunes|Dunas de Samalayuca]] a state protected area south of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].]]\n*Subtropical Highland ([[Oceanic climate|Cfb]]) most common at elevations above {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level; this climate zone has warm summers reaching a maximum temperature of {{convert|28|C|F|1}}and summer lows of {{convert|10|C|F|1}}.

The congress is composed of 33 deputies, of which 22 are directly elected to represent each of the 22 districts in the state. In addition 11 deputies are elected by system of proportional representation through a list of registered political party members. Deputies are elected every three years and cannot be reelected consecutively.\n\nThe judicial branch is led by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice which is constituted of 15 magistrate judges. The judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state congress. The executive branch is headed by the governor of the state, who is elected for one term of six years on the fourth day of October every election year. Governors are not eligible to be reelected due to constitutional one-term limitation.\n\nThe state is represented at the federal level in the [[Congress of the Union]] by three senators and nine deputies (representatives).

Archaeologists believe the civilization began to decline during the 13th century and by the 15th century the inhabitants of Paquim\u00e9 sought refuge in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] while others are thought to have emigrated north and joined the [[Ancestral Pueblo peoples]]. According to anthropologist current natives tribes ([[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], [[Mayo people|Mayo]], [[Opata people|Opata]], and [[Tarahumara]]) are descendants of the Casas Grandes culture.\n\nDuring the 14th century in the northeastern part of the state nomad tribes by the name of [[Jornado]] hunted [[bison]] along the [[Rio Grande]]; they left numerous rock paintings throughout the northeastern part of the state. When the Spanish explorers reached this area they found their descendants, [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]] and [[Manso Indians|Manso]] tribes. In the southern part of the state, in a region known as [[Aridoamerica]], [[Chichimeca]] people survived by hunting, gathering, and farming between AD 300 and 1300. The Chichimeca are the ancestors of the [[Tepehu\u00e1n people]].\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main article|Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain}}\nNueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) was the first province of northern [[New Spain]] to be explored and settled by the Spanish. Around 1528, a group of Spaniard explorers, led by [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca|\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], first entered the territory of what is now Chihuahua. The conquest of the territory lasted nearly one century and encountered fierce resistance from the [[Conchos people|Conchos]] tribe, but the desire of the [[Spanish Crown]] to transform the region into a bustling mining center led to a strong strategy to control the area.\n\n[[File:Deza y Ulloa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa]] the founder of [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]]]\nIn 1562 [[Francisco de Ibarra]] headed a personal expedition in search of the mythical cities of [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|C\u00edbola]] and [[Quivira]]; he traveled through the present-day state of Chihuahua. [[Francisco de Ibarra]] is thought to have been the first European to see the ruins of Paquim\u00e9. In 1564 [[Rodrigo de R\u00edo de Loza]], a lieutenant under Francisco de Ibarra, stayed behind after the expedition and found gold at the foot of the mountains of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]; he founded the first Spanish city in the region, [[Santa B\u00e1rbara, Chihuahua|Santa B\u00e1rbara]] in 1567 by bringing 400 European families to the settlement. A few years later in 1569 Franciscan missionaries led by [[Fray Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez]] from the coast of Sinaloa and the state of Durango founded the first mission in the state in Valle de San Bartolom\u00e9 (present-day Valle de Allende). Fray Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez evangelized the native population until 1581. Between 1586 and 1588 an epidemic caused a temporary exodus of the small population in the territory of Nueva Vizcaya.\n\nSanta B\u00e1rbara became the launching place for expeditions into [[New Mexico]] by Spanish conquistadors like [[Antonio de Espejo]], [[Gaspar Casta\u00f1o]], [[Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez de Uma\u00f1a]], [[Francisco Leyba de Bonilla]], and [[Vicente de Zald\u00edvar]]. Several expeditions were led to find a shorter route from Santa B\u00e1rbara to New Mexico. In April 1598, [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]] found a short route from Santa B\u00e1rbara to New Mexico which came to be called [[El Paso del Norte]] (The Northern Pass). The discovery of El Paso del Norte was important for the expansion of [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]] (The Inner Land Royal Road) to link Spanish settlements in New Mexico to Mexico City; El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated transport of settlers and supplies to New Mexico and [[Camargo, Chihuahua|Camargo]].\n\n[[File:Acueducto Chihuahua - 02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An 18th century colonial aqueduct built in Chihuahua City]]\nIn 1631 [[Juan Rangel de Biezma]] discovered a rich vein of silver and subsequently established San Jos\u00e9 del [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]] near the site. Parral remained an important economic and cultural center for the next 300 years. On December 8, 1659 Fray Garc\u00eda de San Francisco founded the mission of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del R\u00edo del Norte and founded the town El Paso del Norte (present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]) in 1667.\n\nThe Spanish society that developed in the region replaced the sparse population of indigenous peoples. The absence of servants and workers forged the spirit of northern people as self-dependent, creative people that defended their European heritage. In 1680 settlers from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico sought refuge in El Paso del Norte for twelve years after fleeing the attacks from Pueblo tribes, but returned to Santa Fe in 1692 after Diego de Vargas recaptured the city and vicinity. In 1709, [[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa]] founded the state capital [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua City]]; shortly after, the city became the headquarters for the regional mining offices of the Spanish crown known as 'Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cu\u00e9llar' in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cueva Enr\u00edquez]], Duke of Alburquerque and the Marquee of Cu\u00e9llar.\n\n===Mexican War of Independence===\n{{Main article|Mexican War of Independence}}\n[[File:ChihHidalgo1.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A mural of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in the [[Government Palace of Chihuahua]] by [[Aar\u00f3n Pi\u00f1a Mora]]]]\nDuring the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato|Dolores]], [[Guanajuato]] on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the \"Grito de Dolores\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Fern\u00e1ndez Tejedo, Isabel |author2=Carmen Nava Nava |year=2001 |chapter=Images of Independence in the Nineteenth Century: The ''Grito de Dolores'', History and Myth |editors=William H.

Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, [[Mexico City]], but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. Hidalgo reached [[Saltillo]], [[Coahuila]] where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco Javier Venegas, marqu\u00e9s de la Reuni\u00f3n y de Nueva Espa\u00f1a|Francisco Venegas]] in return for Hidalgo's surrender.

The military entered as a third party. The elections for the first regular legislature were disputed, and it was not until May 1, 1826, that the body was installed. The liberals gained control and the opposition responded by fomenting a conspiracy. This was promptly stopped with the aid of informers, and more strenuous measures were taken against the conservatives. Extra powers were conferred on the Durango governor, Santiago Baca Ortiz, deputy to the first national congress, and leader of the liberal party.<ref name=\"The History Company\">History Of The North Mexican States And Texas, Vol. II 1801&ndash;1889, San Francisco, The History Company, Publishers, 1889, Chapter 24</ref>\n\n===Gonz\u00e1lez's rebellion===\nOpponents continued to plot against the new government. In March 1827, Lieutenant J.M. Gonz\u00e1lez proclaimed himself comandante general, arrested the governor, and dissolved the legislature. General Parras was sent to suppress the movement. Comandante general J. J. Ayestar\u00e1n was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]]. When elections failed, the government intervened in favor of the [[Yorkino]] party, which had elected [[Vicente Guerrero]] to the presidency.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nBecause of the general instability of the federal government during 1828, the installation of the new legislature did not take place until the middle of the following year. It was quickly dissolved by Governor [[Santiago de Baca Ortiz]], who replaced it with a more pronounced Yorkino type. When Guerrero's liberal administration was overthrown in December, Gaspar de Ochoa aligned with [[Anastasio Bustamante]], and in February 1830, organized an opposition group that arrested the new governor, F. Elorriaga, along with other prominent Yorkinos. He then summoned the legislature, which had been dissolved by Baca. The civil and military authorities were now headed by J. A. Pescador and [[Sim\u00f3n Ochoa]].<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Vicente Guerrero===\nThe general features of the preceding occurrence applied also to Chihuahua, although in a modified form. The first person elected under the new constitution of 1825 was [[Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonzalez]], who being in [[Sonora]], was induced to remain there. [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Arc\u00e9]] took his place as ruler in Chihuahua. In 1829, Gonz\u00e1lez became general commander of Chihuahua, when his term of office on the west coast expired. Arc\u00e9 was less of a [[yorkino]] than his confr\u00e8re of Durango. Although unable to resist the popular demand for the expulsion of the Spaniards, he soon quarreled with the legislature, which declared itself firmly for [[Vicente Guerrero|Guerrero]], and announcing his support of [[Anastasio Bustamante|Bustamante]]'s revolution, he suspended, in March 1830, eight members of that body, the vice-governor, and several other officials, and expelled them from the state. The course thus outlined was followed by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Isidro Madero]], who succeeded in 1830, associated with [[J. J. Calvo]] as general commander, stringent laws being issued against [[secret societies]], which were supposed to be the main spring to the anti-clerical feeling among liberals.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Durango and Bustamante===\nThe anti-clerical feeling was widespread, and [[Durango]] supported the initial reaction against the government at Mexico. In May 1832, [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]], a rising officer, supported the restoration of President [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza|Pedraza]]. On July 20, Governor Elorriaga was reinstated, and Baca along with the legislative minority were brought back to form a new legislature, which met on September 1. Chihuahua showed no desire to imitate the revolutionary movement and Urrea prepared to invade the state. Comandante-general J.J.Calvo threatened to retaliate, and a conflict seemed imminent. The entry of [[General Santa Anna]] into Mexico brought calm, as the leaders waited for clarity.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Santa Anna===\n[[File:Oleo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.PNG|left|thumb|175px|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]]]\nBishop [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Laureano de Zubir\u00eda]] of Durango was banished for resisting the law relating to priests and other encroachments on the church; another joined the western states in a short lived coalition for sustaining the federal system. Chihuahua adopted the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]] in July 1834 while President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] was in power. Because the plan was not enforced, commanding officer, Colonel [[J.I. Guti\u00e9rrez]], declared the term of the legislature and governor expired on September 3.\n\nAt a convention of citizens called to select a new provisional ruler, Guti\u00e9rrez obtained the vote, with [[P. J. Escalante]] for his deputy, and a council to guide the administration.<ref name=\"The History Company\" /> [[General Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] ordered the reinstatement of Mendarozqueta as comandante general. Guti\u00e9rrez yielded, but Escalante refused to surrender office, demonstrations of support ensued, but Escalante yielded when troops were summoned from [[Zacatecas]]. A new election brought a new legislature, and conforming governors. In September 1835 [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] a federalist army officer came into power.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nComandante general Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez, was nominated governor and military command was given to Colonel J.J. Calvo, whose firmness had earned well-merited praise. The state was in the midst of a war with the [[Apache]]s, which became the focus of all their energy and resources. After a review of the situation, Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez declared that the interests of the territory would be best served by uniting the civil and military power, at least while the campaign lasted. He resigned under opposition, but was renominated in 1837.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n{{Main article|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Chihuahua 1846-1848.svg|thumb|left|200px|Battles of [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Chihuahua]]\nThe state seemed at relative calm compared to the rest of the country due to its close ties to the United States until 1841. In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and steps were taken to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844. Continuing to anticipate a war, the state legislature on July 11, 1846 by decree enlisted 6,000 men to serve along the border; during that time [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] quickly rose to power by portraying zealous anti-American rhetoric. Tr\u00edas took the opportunity to dedicate important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities in preparation to defend the state; he used all the money he received to equip and organize a large volunteer militia. \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas took measures for state self-dependence in regards to state militia due to the diminishing financial support from the federal government.<ref name=\"The History Company\" />\n\nThe United States Congress declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846 after only having a few hours to debate. Although President Jos\u00e9 Mariano Paredes' issuance of a manifesto on May 23 is sometimes considered the declaration of war, Mexico officially declared war by Congress on July 7. After the American invasion of New Mexico, Chihuahua sent 12,000 men led by Colonel Vidal to the border to stop the American military advance into the state. The Mexican forces being impatient to confront the American forces passed beyond El Paso del Norte about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north along the Rio Grande. The first battle that Chihuahua fought was the battle of El Bracito; the Mexican forces consisting of 500 cavalry and 70 infantry confronted a force of 1,100\u20131,200 Americans on December 25, 1846. The battle ended badly by the Mexican forces that were then forced to retreat back into the state of Chihuahua. By December 27, 1846, the American forces occupied El Paso del Norte. General Doniphan maintained camp in El Paso del Norte awaiting supplies and artillery which he received in February 1847.\n\nOn February 8, 1847, Doniphan continued his march with 924 men mostly from Missouri; he accompanied a train of 315 wagons of a large commercial caravan heading to the state capital. Meanwhile, the Mexican forces in the state had time to prepare a defense against the Americans. About {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of the capital where two mountain ranges join from east to west is the only pass into the capital; known as Sacramento Pass, this point is now part of present-day [[Chihuahua City]]. The [[Battle of the Sacramento River|Battle of Sacramento]] was the most important battle fought in the state of Chihuahua because it was the sole defense for the state capital. The battle ended quickly because of some devastating defensive errors from the Mexican forces and the ingenious strategic moves by the American forces. After their loss at the Battle of Sacramento, the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated south, leaving the city to American occupation. Almost 300 Mexicans were killed in the battle, as well as almost 300 wounded. The Americans also confiscated large amounts of Mexican supplies and took 400 Mexican soldiers prisoners of war. American forces maintained an occupation of the state capital for the rest of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n[[File:Batalla de Sacramento.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Battle of the Sacramento River]]]]\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.\u2013Mexican border of the Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among the people of the state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Rosales|Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales]] was the last battle of the Mexican\u2013American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.<ref name=\"Mexican_states\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states.htm#Chihuahua|title=Mexican States A-J|accessdate=January 15, 2011|author=Ben Cahoon|publisher=worldstatesmen.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122103343/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states.htm#Chihuahua|archivedate=January 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the American occupation of the state, the number of Indian attacks was drastically reduced, but in 1848 the attacks resumed to such a degree that the Mexican officials had no choice but to resume military projects to protect Mexican settlements in the state.<ref name=\"The History Company\" /><ref name=\"indi2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seminolenation-indianterritory.org/seminole_in_mexico.htm|title=Seminole in Mexico|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Seminole Nation, I.

After the occupation the people of the state were worried about the potential attack from the hostile indigenous tribes north of the Rio Grande; as a result a decree on July 19, 1848, the state established 18 military colonies along the Rio Grande. The new military colonies were to replace the presidios as population centers to prevent future invasions by indigenous tribes; these policies remained prominent in the state until 1883. Eventually the state replaced the old state security with a state policy to form militias organized with every Mexican in the state capable to serve between the ages of 18 and 55 to fulfill the mandate of having six men defending for every 1000 residents. [[File:Mesilla Chih Outline MaxSize.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Mesilla Valley|La Mesilla]], a large area that was claimed by the state of Chihuahua.]]\n\n=== La Mesilla ===\nThe frontier counties of the state along the border with the United States expected federal protection from the federal government under [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera|Herrera]] and [[Mariano Arista|Arista]], but were soon disappointed by the federal government's decision to deploy military forces to other areas of the country due to internal challenges in the state of [[Jalisco]]. [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] led a rebellion to successfully depose the unpopular conservative Governor Cordero at the end of 1852.\n\nDespite the efforts of strong political forces led by \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas in the state could not stop President Santa Anna from selling [[Mesilla Valley|La Mesilla]] as part of the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on December 30, 1853 for 15 million USD. It was then ratified in the United States on April 25, 1854 and signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]], with final approval action taken by Mexico on June 8, 1854.  The citizens of the area held strong anti-American sentiments and raided American settlers and travelers across the area.\n\n===The Reform War and the French Intervention===\n{{main article| Reform War| French Intervention}}\n[[File:PalGobJuarez.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A mural by Pi\u00f1a in the Government Palace, honouring the liberators [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\nThe state united behind the [[Plan of Ayutla]] and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the [[Reform War]] with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General [[Cajen]] briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders [[Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]]. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in ''La Batalla del Gallo''. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]] of Durango and  [[J.E. Mu\u00f1oz]] of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree.  The state elected General [[Luis Terrazas]], a liberal leader, as governor; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861.[[File:Casa de Juarez - Chihuahua, Chihuahua - 02.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Museo Casa Ju\u00e1rez]], a 19th-century building in downtown Chihuahua city, that served as the ''de facto'' National Palace of Mexico.]]\n\nIn consequence to the Reform War, the federal government was bankrupt and could not pay its foreign debts to Spain, England, and France.  On July 17, 1861, President Ju\u00e1rez decreed a moratorium on payment to foreign debtors for a period of two years. Spain, England, and France did not accept the moratorium by Mexico; they united at the Convention of the Triple Alliance on October 31, 1861 in which they agreed to take possession of several custom stations within Mexico as payment. A delegation of the Triple Alliance arrived in Veracruz in December 1861. President Ju\u00e1rez immediately sent his Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Manuel Doblado]], who is able to reduce the debts through the [[Pacto de Soledad]] (Soledad Pact). General [[Juan Prim]] of Spain persuaded the English delegation to accept the terms of the Pacto de Soledad, but the French delegation refused.\n\nThe liberal political forces maintained strong control over the state government until shortly after the [[French Intervention]] which turned the tables in favor to the conservative forces once again. The intervention had serious repercussions for the state of Chihuahua. President Ju\u00e1rez, in an effort to organize a strong defense against the French, decreed a list of national guard units that every state had to contribute to the Ministry of War and the Navy; Chihuahua was responsible for inducting 2,000 men. Regaining power, Governor [[Luis Terrazas]] assigned the First Battalion of Chihuahua for integration into the national army led by General [[Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega]]; the battalion was deployed to Puebla. After the defeat of the army in Puebla, the Ju\u00e1rez administration was forced to abandon Mexico City; the president retreated further north seeking refuge in the state of Chihuahua.\n\nUnder threat from the conservative forces, Governor Terrazas was deposed, and the state legislature proclaimed martial law in the state in April 1864 and established [[Jes\u00fas Jos\u00e9 Casavantes]] as the new governor. In response, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni]] decided to march to Chihuahua with presidential support. Meanwhile, Maximilian von Habsburg, a younger brother of the Emperor of Austria, was proclaimed Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Mexico on April 10, 1864 with the backing of Napoleon III and a group of Mexican conservatives. Before President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] was forced to flee, Congress granted him an emergency extension of his presidency, which would go into effect in 1865 when his term expired, and last until 1867. At the same time, the state liberals and conservatives compromised to allow the popular [[\u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas]] take the governorship; by this time the French forces had taken control over the central portions of the country and were making preparations to invade the northern states.\n\n[[File:Chihuahua 1862-1867-en.svg|300px|left|thumb|Overview of military actions]]\nThe French forces tried to subdue and capture the liberal government based in [[Saltillo]]. On September 21, 1864, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni and Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega lost against the French forces at the Battle of Estanzuelas; the supreme government led by President Ju\u00e1rez was forced to evacuate the city of [[Saltillo]] and relocate to Chihuahua.  Ju\u00e1rez stopped in [[Ciudad Jim\u00e9nez]],  [[Valle de Allende]], and [[Parral, Chihuahua|Hidalgo de Parral]], in turn.  He decreed Parral the capital of Mexico from October 2\u20135, 1864.<ref>[http://inegi.gob.mx/geo/default.aspx Secci\u00f3n en INEGI Estado Chihuahua, municipio Hidalgo del Parral, localidad 0001 Enero 7 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824154827/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/geo/default.aspx |date=August 24, 2007 }}</ref> Perceiving the threat from the advancing French forces, the president continued his evacuation through [[Camargo (Chihuahua)|Santa Rosal\u00eda de Camargo]], [[Santa Cruz de Rosales]], and finally [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]. On October 12, 1864, the people of the state gave President Ju\u00e1rez an overwhelmingly supportive reception, led by Governor \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas.  On October 15, 1864 the city of Chihuahua was declared the temporary capital of Mexico.\n\nAfter running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango, General [[Agust\u00edn Enrique Brincourt]] made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua. On July 8, 1865 Brincourt crossed the [[Nazas River]] in northern Durango, heading toward Chihuahua. On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of R\u00edo Florido into Ciudad Jim\u00e9nez; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral. Brincourt continued through Santa Rosal\u00eda de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. President Ju\u00e1rez remained in the state capital until August 5, 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte (present-day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city. On the same day, the President named General [[Manuel Ojinaga]] the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces. Meanwhile, General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. At the Battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces. On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital.  Brincourt designated [[Tom\u00e1s Zuloaga]] as Prefect of Chihuahua.<ref name=\"MEXHIS\">{{cite book\n|last=Riva Palacios\n|first=Vicente\n|title= Revoluci\u00f3n :  M\u00e9xico \u00e1 trav\u00e9s de los siglos: historia general y completa del desenvolvimiento social, pol\u00edtico, religioso, militar, art\u00edstico, cient\u00edfico y literario de M\u00e9xico desde a antig\u00fcedad m\u00e1s remota hasta la \u00e9poca actual\n|year=1940\n|publisher= University of California Libraries (G.

General [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]] ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City. General Brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state, but his request was denied.  After the death of General Ojinaga, the Republican government declared General Villagran in charge of the fight against the Imperial forces. The French left the state on October 29, 1865. President Ju\u00e1rez returned to Chihuahua City on November 20, 1865 and remained in the city until December 9, 1865 when he returned to El Paso del Norte. Shortly after the president left Chihuahua City, [[Luis Terrazas|Terrazas]] was restored as governor of the state on December 11, 1865.\n\nMaximilian was deeply dissatisfied with General Bazaine's decision to abandon the state capital of Chihuahua and immediately ordered [[Agust\u00edn B. Billaut]] to recapture the city. On December 11, 1865, Billaut with a force of 500 men took control of the city. By January 31, 1866 Billaut was ordered to leave Chihuahua, but he left behind 500 men to maintain control. At the zenith of their power, the imperialist forces controlled all but four states in Mexico; the only states to maintain strong opposition to the French were: Guerrero, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California.<ref name=\"Resistance_states\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://mexicanhistory.org/French.htm\n |title       = French intervention and the Second Mexican Empire 1864&ndash;1867\n |accessdate  = January 16, 2011\n |publisher   = MexicanHistory.org\n |location    = MexicanHistory.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081800/http://mexicanhistory.org/French.htm\n |archivedate = July 27, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ChihuahuaZocalo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Plaza de Armas and the [[Cathedral of Chihuahua|Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla and St Francis of Assisi]]]]President Ju\u00e1rez once again based his government in the state of Chihuahua and it served as the center for the resistance against the French invasion throughout Mexico. On March 25, 1866, a battle ensued in the Plaza de Armas in the center of Chihuahua City between the French imperial forces that were guarding the plaza and the Republican forces led by General Terrazas. Being completely caught off guard, the French imperial forces sought refuge by bunkering themselves in the [[Cathedral of Chihuahua|Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla, and St Fancis of Assisi]] and made it almost impossible to penetrate their defenses. General Terrazas then decided to fire a heavy artillery barrage with 8&nbsp;kg cannonballs. The first cannon fired hit a bell in the tower of the church, instantly breaking it in half; soon after, 200 men of the imperial army forces surrendered. The republican forces had recovered control over the state capital. The bell in the church was declared a historical monument and can be seen today in the Cathedral. By April 1866, the state government had established a vital trading route from Chihuahua City to San Antonio, Texas; the government began to replenish their supplies and reinforce their fight against the Imperial forces.\n\nGeneral Aguirre moved to the deserts of the southeastern portion of the state and defeated the French forces in Parral, led by Colonel Cottret. By the middle of 1866, the state of Chihuahua was declared free of enemy control; Parral was the last French stronghold within the state.  On June 17, 1866, President Ju\u00e1rez arrived in Chihuahua City and remained in the capital until December 10, 1866. During his two years in the state of Chihuahua, President Ju\u00e1rez passed ordinances regarding the rights of adjudication of property and nationalized the property of the clergy. The distance of the French forces and their allies allowed the Ministry of War, led by General Negrete, to reorganize the state's national guard into the Patriotic Battalion of Chihuahua, which was deployed to fight in the battle of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] against the French. After a series of major defeats and an escalating threat from Prussia, France began pulling troops out of Mexico in late 1866. Disillusioned with the liberal political views of Maximilian, the Mexican conservatives abandoned him, and in 1867 the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated. Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court; despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence. Maximilian was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.\n\n===Ju\u00e1rez Government===\n[[File:Monumento a Benito Juarez Cd Juarez.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Monument to Benito Ju\u00e1rez in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua]]\nPresident Benito Ju\u00e1rez was re-elected in the general election of 1867 in which he received strong liberal support, especially in Chihuahua. Luis Terrazas was confirmed by the people of Chihuahua to be governor of the state. But soon after the election, President Ju\u00e1rez had another crisis on his hands; the Ju\u00e1rez administration was suspected to be involved in the assassination of the military chief Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni executed by General Canto in August 1868. General Canto turned himself over to [[Donato Guerra]]. Canto was sentenced to death, but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment. The sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government. In response, the Ju\u00e1rez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights, but the governor of Chihuahua did not support this action. Hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of 1871 which was perceived to be fraudulent. A new popular leader arose among the rebels, Porfirio D\u00edaz. The federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in Durango an Chihuahua. On July 18, 1872, President Ju\u00e1rez died from a heart attack; soon after, many of his supporters ceased the fighting. Peace returned to Chihuahua and the new government was led by Governor Antonio Ochoa (formerly a co-owner of the [[Batopilas, Chihuahua|Batopilas]] silver mines) in 1873 after Luis Terrazas finished his term in 1872.\n\nBut the peace in the state did not last long, the elections of 1875 caused new hostilities. \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas led a new movement against the government in June 1875 and maintained control over the government until September 18, 1875 when [[Donato Guerra]] the orchestrator of the Revolution of the North was captured.  Donato Guerra was assassinated in a suburb of Chihuahua City where he was incarcerated for conspiring with  \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas. During October 1875 several locations were controlled by rebel forces, but the government finally regained control on November 25, 1875.\n\n===Porfiriato===\n[[File:Porfirio Diaz in uniform.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Porfirio D\u00edaz in military uniform]]After the death of the president Benito Ju\u00e1rez in 1872, the first magistracy of the country was occupied by the vice-president Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada, who called for new elections. Two candidates were registered; Lerdo de Tejada and General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], one of the heroes of the [[Battle of Puebla]] which had taken place on May 5, 1862. Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio D\u00edaz rebelled against President Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada. The [[Plan of Tuxtepec]] defended the \"No Re-election\" principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio D\u00edaz; Governor [[Antonio Ochoa]] was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio D\u00edaz then helped Tr\u00edas regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio D\u00edaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877.\nDuring the first years of the [[Porfiriato]] (Porfirio D\u00edaz Era), the D\u00edaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte. [[File:PalAlvarado.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Palacio de Alvarado is the house of [[Pedro Alvarado Torres]], one of the richest silver barons of Mexico during the Porfiriato.]]The officials in Mexico City reduced the price of corn from six cents to two cents a pound. The northern portion of the state continued to decline economically which led to another revolt led by G. Casavantes in August 1879; Governor Tr\u00edas was accused of misappropriation of funds and inefficient administration of the state. Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing Governor Tr\u00edas to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Trevi\u00f1o; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Tr\u00edas. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and water rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled. Despite the difficulties at the beginning, D\u00edaz was able to secure and stabilize the state, which earned the confidence and support of the people.\nDuring the 1880s, the D\u00edaz administration consolidated several government agencies throughout Mexico to control credit and currency by the creation of the Institution of Credit and Currency. Because D\u00edaz had created such an effective centralized government, he was able to concentrate decision making and maintain control over the economic instability.<ref name=\"skidmore\">{{cite book\n|last=Skidmore\n|first=Thomas\n|author2=Peter H.

During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The D\u00edaz administration helped Governor [[Luis Terrazas]] by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad J\u00faarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cities of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels. By the end of the Terrazas term, the state experienced an increase in commerce, mining, and banking. When the banks were nationalized, Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico.\n\nUnder Governor Miguel Ahumada, the education system in the state was unified and brought under tighter control by the state government, and the metric system was standardized throughout the state to replace the colonial system of weights and measures. On September 16, 1897, the Civilian Hospital of Chihuahua was inaugurated in Chihuahua City and became known among the best in the country. In 1901 the Heroes Theater (Teatro de los H\u00e9roes) opened in Chihuahua City. On August 18, 1904, Governor Terrazas was replaced by Governor Enrique C. Creel. From 1907 to 1911, the Creel administration succeeded in advancing the state's legal system, modernizing the mining industry, and raising public education standards. In 1908 the Chihuahuan State Penitentiary was built, and the construction on the first large scale dam project was initiated on the Chuviscar River. During the same time, the streets of Chihuahua City were paved and numerous monuments were built in Chihuahua City and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\n\n===Mexican Revolution===\n[[File:Angel chihuahua.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|The government palace built during the early 20th century now a museum.]]\nD\u00edaz created an effective centralized government that helped concentrate wealth and political power among the elite upper class, mostly [[Criollo people|criollo]]. The economy was characterized by the construction of factories, roads, dams, and better farms. The D\u00edaz administration passed new land laws that virtually unraveled all the rights previously recognized and the land reforms passed by President Benito Ju\u00e1rez. No peasant or farmer could claim the land he occupied without formal legal title.\n\n[[File:Quinta Carolina Main House.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Quinta Carolina is an hacienda owned by the Terrazas family.]]\nA handful of families owned large estates (known as [[hacienda]]s) and controlled the greater part of the land across the state while the vast majority of Chihuahuans were landless. The state economy was largely defined by ranching and mining. At the expense of the [[working class]], the D\u00edaz administration promoted economic growth by encouraging investment from foreign companies from the United Kingdom, France, [[Imperial Germany]] and the United States.  The [[proletariat]] was often exploited, and found no legal protection or political recourse to redress injustices.<ref>{{cite book | title = The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 15th Edition | article = Porfirio D\u00edaz | year = 1993 | pages = 70}}</ref>\n\nDespite the internal stability (known as the ''paz porfiriana''), modernization, and economic growth in Mexico during the Porfiriato from 1876 to 1910, many across the state became deeply dissatisfied with the political system.  When D\u00edaz first ran for office, he committed to a strict \u201cNo Re-election\u201d policy in which he disqualified himself to serve consecutive terms. Eventually backtracking on many of his initial political positions D\u00edaz became a de facto dictator.  D\u00edaz became increasingly unpopular due to brutal suppression of political dissidents by using the [[Rurales]] and manipulating the elections to solidify his political machine. The working class was frustrated with the D\u00edaz regime due to the corruption of the political system that had increased the inequality between the rich and poor.  The peasants felt disenfranchised by the policies that promoted the unfair distribution of land where 95% of the land was owned by the top 5%.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crow | first = John A. | title = The Epic of Latin America | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1992 | location = Berkeley, CA | pages = [https://archive.org/details/epicoflatinameri00crow/page/673 673] | isbn = 0-520-07723-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/epicoflatinameri00crow/page/673 }}</ref>\n\nThe end of the ''Porfiriato'' came in 1910 with the beginning of the Mexican Revolution.

Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] with D\u00edaz. It required that D\u00edaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the United States and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called \"Orozquistas\"\u2014also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")\u2014after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions. The rural working class, which had supported Madero, now took up arms against him in support of Orozco.\n\nIn March 1912, in Chihuahua, Gen. Pascual Orozco revolted. Immediately President Francisco Madero commanded Gen. Victoriano Huerta of the Federal Army, to put down the Orozco revolt. The governor of Chihuahua mobilized the state militia led by Colonel Pancho Villa to supplement General Huerta. By June, Villa notified Huerta that the Orozco revolt had been put down and that the militia would consider themselves no longer under Huerta's command and would depart.

Soon after the assassination of President Madero, Carranza returned to Mexico to fight Huerta, but with only a handful of comrades. However, by 1913 his forces had swelled into an army of thousands, called the [[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]] (Northern Division). Villa and his army, along with [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], united with Carranza to fight against Huerta. In March 1914 Carranza traveled to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which served as rebellion's capital for the remainder of the struggle with Huerta. In April 1914 U.S. opposition to Huerta had reached its peak, blockading the regime's ability to resupply from abroad. Carranza trying to keep his nationalistic credentials threatened war with the United States.

After Carranza took control in 1914, Villa and other revolutionaries who opposed him met at what was called the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]]. The convention deposed Carranza in favor of [[Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez]]. In the winter of 1914 Villa's and Zapata's troops entered and occupied Mexico City. Villa was forced from the city in early 1915 and attacked the forces of Gen. Obreg\u00f3n at the [[Battle of Celaya]] and was badly defeated in the bloodiest battle of the revolution, with thousands dead. With the defeat of Villa, Carranza seized power. A short time later the United States recognized Carranza as president of Mexico. Even though Villa's forces were badly depleted by his loss at Celaya, he continued his fight against the Carranza government. Finally, in 1920, Obreg\u00f3n\u2014who had defeated him at Celaya\u2014finally reached an agreement with Villa end his rebellion.\n\nPublic opinion pressured the U.S. government to bring Villa to justice for the raid on [[Columbus, New Mexico]]; U.S. President Wilson sent Gen. [[John J.

After nearly a year of pursuing Villa, American forces returned to the United States. The American intervention had been limited to the western sierras of Chihuahua. Villa had the advantage of intimately knowing the inhospitable terrain of the Sonoran Desert and the almost impassable Sierra Madre mountains and always managed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers.

The area is landlocked by the states of [[Sonora]] to the west, [[Sinaloa]] to the south-west, [[Durango]] to the south, and [[Coahuila]] to the east, and by the U.S. states of [[Texas]] to the northeast and [[New Mexico]] to the north. The state is made up of three geologic regions: Mountains, Plains-Valleys, and Desert, which occur in large bands from west to east. Because of the different geologic regions there are contrasting climates and ecosystems.\n\n[[File:CERRO DE MOHINORA.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Cerro Mohinora]] is the highest point in Chihuahua]]\nThe main mountain range in the state is the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] reaching a maximum altitude of 10,826&nbsp;ft (3,300&nbsp;m) known as [[Cerro Mohinora]]. Mountains account for one third of the state's surface area which include large coniferous forests. The climate in the mountainous regions varies. Chihuahua has more forests than any other state in Mexico making the area a bountiful source of wood; the mountainous areas are rich in minerals important to Mexico's mining industry. Precipitation and temperature in the mountainous areas depends on the elevation. Between the months of November and March snow storms are possible in the lower elevations and are frequent in the higher elevations. There are several watersheds located in the Sierra Madre Occidental all of the water that flows through the state; most of the rivers finally empty into the [[R\u00edo Grande]]. Temperatures in some canyons in the state reach over {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the summer while the same areas rarely drop below {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the winter. Microclimates found in the heart of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state could be considered tropical, and wild tropical plants have been found in some canyons.  ''La Barranca del Cobre'', or [[Copper Canyon]], a spectacular canyon system larger and deeper than the [[Grand Canyon]]; the canyon also contains Mexico's two tallest waterfalls: [[Basaseachic Falls]] and [[Piedra Volada]]. There are two national parks found in the mountainous area of the state: [[Cumbres de Majalca National Park]] and [[Basaseachic Falls National Park]].\n\n[[File:Satellite Chihuahua.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of the state of Chihuahua shows the varying terrain from the green alpine mountains in the southwest, to the steppe highlands in the center, to the desert in the east.]]\n[[File:Cascada Basaseachi.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Basaseachic Falls]] in [[Copper Canyon]].]]\nThe plains at the foot of the Sierra Madre Occidental is an elongated mesa known as [[Altiplanicie Mexicana]] that exhibits a steppe climate and serves as a transition zone from the mountain climate in the western part of the state to the desert climate in the eastern side of the state. The steppe zone accounts for a third of the state's area, and it experiences pronounced dry and wet seasons. The pronounced rainy season in the steppe is usually observed in the months of July, August, and September. The steppe also encounters extreme temperatures that often reach over {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in the winter. The steppe zone is an important agriculture zone due to an extensive development of canals exploiting several rivers that flow down from the mountains. The steppe zone is the most populated area of the state.\n\nThe most important river in the state is [[R\u00edo Conchos]] which is the largest tributary to the [[R\u00edo Grande]] from the Mexican side; the river descends from the zenith of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the southwest part of the state and winds through the center of the state where the water is exploited in the steppe zone and it eventually empties into the R\u00edo Grande in the small desert town of [[Ojinaga]].\n\nThe desert zone also accounts for about a third of the state's surface area. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] is an international biome that also extends into the neighboring Mexican state of [[Coahuila]] and into the U.S. states of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]. The desert zone is mainly of flat topography with some small mountain ranges that run north to south. The desert in the state varies slightly with a small variant in climate. The lower elevations of the desert zone are found in the north along the Rio Grande which experience hotter temperatures in the summer and winter while the southern portion of the desert zone experiences cooler temperatures due to its higher elevation. The Samalayuca dunes cover an area of about 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; it is an impressive site of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] and is a protected area by the state due to unique species of plants and animals.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Namurachi Canyon.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Nam\u00farachi]] is in the semi-arid zone.]]\nThe climate in the state depends mainly in the elevation of the terrain. According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] the state has five major climate zones. The [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] dominates the western part of the state; there are two main climates in this area:  [[Oceanic climate|Subtropical Highland]] (Cfb) and [[Humid Subtropical]] (Cwa). There are some microclimates in the state due to the varying topology mostly found in the western side of the state. The two best known microclimates are: [[Tropical savanna climate]] (Aw) in deep canyons located in the extreme southern part of the state; [[Continental Mediterranean climate]] (Dsb) in the extremely high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Satellite image to the right shows the vegetation is much greener in the west because of the cooler temperatures and larger amounts of precipitation as compared to the rest of the state.\n\nIn the far eastern part of the state the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] dominates due to low precipitation and extremely high temperatures; some areas of the eastern part of the state are so dry no vegetation is found like the [[Samalayuca Dune Fields|Sand Dunes of Samalayuca]]. There are two distinctive climate zones found in the eastern part of the state: Hot Desert (BWh) and Cool Desert (BWk) which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; this zone is the [[Steppe]] characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones.[[File:Climate Zones of Chihuahua.png|thumb|left|200px|'''''K\u00f6ppen Climate Zones'''''\n{|\n|- valign=top |\n|\n{{legend|#1C4827|[[Oceanic climate|Subtropical Highland Cfb]]}}\n{{legend|#296D3C|[[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical Cwa]]}}\n{{legend|#AAD699|[[Semi-arid climate|Steppe BSk]]}}\n{{legend|#D7BF99|[[Desert climate|Cool Desert BWk]]}}\n{{legend|#F4F3B2|[[Desert climate|Hot Desert BWh]]}}\n| width=6 |\n|}\n]]\n\n[[File:Chihuahua Steppe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Altiplanicie Mexicana]] during the monsoon season.]]\n[[File:Miviajeachihuahua.JPG|thumbnail|200px|[[Chihuahua white pine]]s amid snow.]]\n[[File:Dunas samalayuca.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Samalayuca Dunes|Dunas de Samalayuca]] a state protected area south of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].]]\n*Subtropical Highland ([[Oceanic climate|Cfb]]) most common at elevations above {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level; this climate zone has warm summers reaching a maximum temperature of {{convert|28|C|F|1}}and summer lows of {{convert|10|C|F|1}}.

The government is centrally located in the state capital [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua City]].\n\nThe legislative branch consists of an elected assembly of representatives to form the state congress. The congress is composed of 33 deputies, of which 22 are directly elected to represent each of the 22 districts in the state. In addition 11 deputies are elected by system of proportional representation through a list of registered political party members. Deputies are elected every three years and cannot be reelected consecutively.\n\nThe judicial branch is led by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice which is constituted of 15 magistrate judges. The judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state congress. The executive branch is headed by the governor of the state, who is elected for one term of six years on the fourth day of October every election year. Governors are not eligible to be reelected due to constitutional one-term limitation.\n\nThe state is represented at the federal level in the [[Congress of the Union]] by three senators and nine deputies (representatives).

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general. Studying M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts of [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]], Clarke points out that there is also an \"in-house\" perspective on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, which shows that he interacted with his former wife turned ''bhik\u1e63un\u012b'' frequently<!--107, 109--> to mentor her.<!--113--> Shortly after Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became ordained under the Buddha, he met his former wife Bhadra, who had joined an order of [[History of nudity#India|naked ascetics]] led by [[Purana Kassapa|Nirgrantha P\u016bra\u1e47a]] ({{lang-pi |P\u016bra\u1e47a Kassapa}}). She was regularly targeted for rape by her fellow ascetics, however.

By receiving food from these donors, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was considered a [[field of merit]] for them, or, in other words, an opportunity for them to make merit and \"vanquish their bad [[karma in Buddhism|karma]]\".<!--57--> In one case, he sought out a very poor woman who was at the end of her life, just to give her an opportunity to give a little.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures. She replied she also did not care for such matters, whereupon he revealed that he was her future husband.{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}} Both versions agree that the two agreed to marry and to live celibately, to the chagrin of Pippali's parents.{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}\n\nPippali is depicted in the P\u0101li version as very wealthy, using much perfume and possessing much land and chariots.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} Later, in the P\u0101li version, Pippali and Bhadra saw animals eating each other on the fertile fields as they were plowed by their workers.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

{"title_page": "Rob Davis (comics)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014}}\n'''Rob Davis''' is a British [[comics]] artist, writer, and editorial illustrator located in [[Blandford Forum]], Dorset. British comics magazines and features to which he has contributed include ''Roy of the Rovers'', ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]''.  He has also created the graphic novels ''Don Quixote'' (based on Cervantes' [[Don Quixote|novel of the same name]]) and an original story, ''The Motherless Oven''.\n\n==Profile==\nDavis' first strips were seen in the self-published ''Slang'' comic, which he published with Sean Longcroft. Davis' first professional work was on the football comic \"Roy of the Rovers\" relaunch as a monthly title in 1993. The original title was concluded in March 1993 with Roy Race having crashed his private helicopter, readers were left not knowing if he was alive or dead. In September 1993, Roy awoke from a coma to find his famous left foot amputated after the crash. The new Roy was 'Delroy' of the Rovers, Paul \"Delroy\" Ntende, a ragamuffin who played for Nigeria. The new approach by Davis and editor, Stuart Green, was committed to the Kick Racism Out of Football Campaign. Davis also designed posters for the campaign featuring Delroy and Rocky. The strip itself dealt with issues of racism in the game, among other subjects. Green and Davis introduced many other innovations. Among these, he split the history of Roy Race into three generations of Race: grandfather, father and son. In addition to the monthly stories in Roy of the Rovers, Davis drew another Roy strip in ''Shoot'' magazine as a two-page spread every week. Many of the changes made during Green and Davis' tenure on the strip were dropped in later revamps of the magazine.\n\nDavis went to work for ''2000AD'', drawing \"Judge Dredd Lawman of the Future\", a more child-friendly Judge Dredd spin-off based on the 1996 film. Davis then became disenchanted with comics and pursued a career as an illustrator before returning as a comics writer on \"Bus Stop\", \"The Woman Who Sold the World\" and \"The Widow's Curse\", published in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. He worked on a number of other stories for ''Doctor Who Magazine'' solely as an artist, rather than a writer.\n\nDavis submitted a four-page comic strip to a 2010 graphic short story competition sponsored by ''The Observer''. The submission, entitled \"How I Built My Father\" failed to win, it generated interest and Davis returned to comics with another short strip for the anthology ''Solipsistic Pop''.\n\nIn 2011, Davis conceived of the idea of a collaborative graphic novel which would showcase the talent of the UK comics scene, made up of chapters by many creators. The result was ''Nelson'', co-edited with [[Woodrow Phoenix]]. Phoenix and Davis guided a team of 54 creators to produce 54 chapters of a single story about a woman named Nell. As a storytelling experiment, it won huge critical acclaim. ''The Observer'' newspaper awarded it its Graphic Novel of The Month, November 2011. The Times newspaper awarded it Best Graphic Novel of 2011, it was nominated for an Eisner Award and was voted Book of The Year in the British Comic Awards 2012.\n\nHe then began work on a graphic novel adaptation of ''Don Quixote'', which he made in two parts. The first volume was published in 2011 by SelfMadeHero and featured in many best of the yearlists. Davis released the second volume in 2013.  ''The Complete Don Quixote''  ({{ISBN|978-1906838317}}) contains both parts. The collected was nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2014.\n\n''The Motherless Oven'', a surreal coming of age story based on \"How I Built My Father\", was published by SelfMadeHero in 2014. It won the British Comics Award for best book and was nominated for the Best Graphic Album \u2013 New [[Eisner Award]]. A sequel, entitled ''The Can Opener's Daughter'', was published in December 2016, while a third volume ''The Book of Forks'' was published in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selfmadehero.com/news/2016/11/launching-at-gosh-comics-the-can-openers-daughter-by-rob-davis/|title=Launching at Gosh!

{"title_page": "Robert Jackson (surgeon)", "text_new": "[[File:Robert Jackson (surgeon).jpg|thumb|Robert Jackson]]\n'''Robert Jackson''' M.D. (1750\u20131827) was a Scottish physician-surgeon, reformer, and inspector-general of army hospitals.\n\n==Life==\nHe was born at [[Stonebyres]], near the [[Falls of Clyde (waterfalls)|Falls of Clyde]], he was the son of a small farmer. After schooling at [[Wandon]] and [[Crawford, South Lanarkshire|Crawford]] he was apprenticed for three years to a surgeon at [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]], and in 1768 joined the medical classes at Edinburgh. Supporting himself by going twice on a whaling voyage as surgeon, he finished his studies without graduating, and went to [[Jamaica]], where he acted as assistant to a doctor at [[Savanna-la-mer]] from 1774 to 1780. He next made his way to [[New York (state)|New York]], with the intention of joining the state volunteers; but he was eventually received by the colonel of a Scottish regiment (the 71st) as ensign, with the duties of hospital-mate.{{sfn|Creighton|1892}}\n\nHe arrived at [[Greenock]] in 1782, and travelled to London on foot. He left early in 1783 on a journey on foot through France, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, and landed on his return at [[Southampton]] with four shillings in his pocket. He walked to London, and thence, in January 1784, to [[Perth, Perthshire|Perth]] where the 71st regiment was stationed. Coming at length to Edinburgh he remained two or three months, and married the daughter of Dr. Stephenson, and the niece of an officer whom he had known in New York. His wife's fortune placed him in easy circumstances, and he spent the next year in Paris, attending hospitals and studying languages (including Arabic), and then went to [[Leyden]], where he passed an examination for M.D. in 1786.{{sfn|Creighton|1892}}\n\nJackson settled as a physician at [[Stockton-on-Tees]], and remained there seven years. When war broke out in 1793, he was appointed surgeon to the 3rd regiment (Buffs), on the strength of a book which he had published on West Indian fevers.

Twenty-five years later, it was announced that the planned route for the [[U.S. Route 422|Pottstown Expressway]] was to go through the Audubon property. Camiel was credited with / blamed for applying political pressure to reroute the superhighway around the bird sanctuary:\n\n<blockquote>Central to the arguments concerning politicians appears to be the controversial \"Camiel Loop.\" [Montgomery County Planning Commission associate director] Plutte said that the cost of rerouting the Pottstown Expressway around the home of Peter J. Camiel caused the price of the highway to jump from $5 million to $8 million, and most recently to more than $10 million in the past six months. As the highway leaves the connection with Betzwood Bridge and aims northwest toward Pottstown, it veers sharply south [''sic'' west], down and around Camiel's farm, \"Fatland.\" The parabolic dip in the road mean several miles of additional roadway, roadway that Pottstown was denied. Plutte said the Camiel loop was installed to avert a \"potential challenge\" arising out of an environmental study. Camiel's farm is near the Audubon Sanctuary, which according to original plans, would have had to surrender land to the highway crews. Federal funds, which pay for 70 per cent of the Pottstown Expressway, could be jeopardized by the taking of the park land, Plutte said.<ref>William G. Reinecke, \"Pottstown expressway link blocked; Construction may start in 1989,\" ''The Pottstown Mercury'', September 23, 1976, p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhether Camiel acted from selfish or selfless motives (or a combination of both), the rerouting of the Pottstown Expressway spared Mill Grove &ndash; now a [[National Historic Landmark]] &ndash; and minimized the adverse effect on Fatland.

Twenty-five years later, it was announced that the planned route for the [[U.S. Route 422|Pottstown Expressway]] was to go through the Audubon property. Camiel was credited with / blamed for applying political pressure to reroute the superhighway around the bird sanctuary:\n\n<blockquote>Central to the arguments concerning politicians appears to be the controversial \"Camiel Loop.\" [Montgomery County Planning Commission associate director] Plutte said that the cost of rerouting the Pottstown Expressway around the home of Peter J. Camiel caused the price of the highway to jump from $5 million to $8 million, and most recently to more than $10 million in the past six months. As the highway leaves the connection with Betzwood Bridge and aims northwest toward Pottstown, it veers sharply south [''sic'' west], down and around Camiel's farm, \"Fatland.\" The parabolic dip in the road mean several miles of additional roadway, roadway that Pottstown was denied. Plutte said the Camiel loop was installed to avert a \"potential challenge\" arising out of an environmental study. Camiel's farm is near the Audubon Sanctuary, which according to original plans, would have had to surrender land to the highway crews. Federal funds, which pay for 70 per cent of the Pottstown Expressway, could be jeopardized by the taking of the park land, Plutte said.<ref>William G. Reinecke, \"Pottstown expressway link blocked; Construction may start in 1989,\" ''The Pottstown Mercury'', September 23, 1976, p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhether Camiel acted from selfish or selfless motives (or a combination of both), the rerouting of the Pottstown Expressway spared Mill Grove &ndash; now a [[National Historic Landmark]] &ndash; and minimized the adverse effect on Fatland. The Camiels owned the property for 44 years, and were buried together in its private cemetery.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=118909314 Peter J.

The Treffry family had landholdings but their predominant interest was in businesses centred on the port of Fowey, of which they were the leading citizens.<ref name = Goring/>\n\n==Career==\nBy 1524 he had been appointed a tax collector for Cornwall and in 1529 was selected as the senior of the two [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s for the borough of [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]]. He probably sat for Bodmin again in June 1536 and may well have represented the town in 1539 and 1542, the records however being lost.<ref name = Goring/>\n\nHis arrival on the national scene led to a court appointment as a [[Gentleman Usher]] of the Chamber by 1533. In that year he was made a [[justice of the peace]] for Cornwall and Collector of Customs for Plymouth and Fowey, giving up the latter post in 1541.<ref name = Goring/>\n\nThe south Cornish coast being vulnerable to attack from the sea, the government started building the artillery fort called [[St Mawes Castle]], where he was named as Captain in 1541 and supervised the completion of the works. Not only did he have to meet part of the cost himself but for the war against France in 1544 had also to finance both a contingent of soldiers for the army and the equipping of a ship, the ''Falcon Lisle'', for the navy. In addition he had to raise funds for ransoming his son, who had been taken prisoner by the enemy.<ref name = Goring/>\n\nHis fortunes took a turn for the worse when King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] died in July 1553. After he attended a general meeting of Cornwall notables at which the [[Protestant]] [[Lady Jane Grey]] was proclaimed queen, he was stripped of his positions by the government of the [[Catholic]] successor, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. He lost St Mawes Castle, in which he had been living, and his seat on the [[commission of the peace]]. Although he remained a Protestant, the government did later give him some responsibilities for coastal defence.<ref name = Goring/>\n\nIt is possible he was one of the MPs elected for Cornwall in 1554 but  is more likely to have been another Thomas Treffry, not a legitimate son of his, who had sat for Bodmin in 1545. When Mary was succeeded by the Protestant Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] in 1559, he was restored to his position as a county magistrate.<ref name = Goring/>\n\nHe died on either 24 or 31 January 1564 and was buried in the church of Fowey, with a memorial also being erected in the church of [[St Kew]].<ref name = Goring/>\n[[File:Place, Place Road, Fowey - geograph.org.uk - 661246.jpg|thumb|Place House and Fowey church]]\n\n==Family==\nBy a settlement dated 29 September 1505, he married Elizabeth, daughter of John II Killigrew (died 1536), of [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]],<ref name = Goring/> and his wife Jane, daughter of John Petit, of Ardevora, and his wife Margaret Trenowyth.\n\nTheir son and heir was John (died 1590), who married first Jane, daughter of the MP [[Reginald Mohun (died 1567)|Reginald Mohun]] and his wife Joan Trevanion, and secondly in 1558 Emmeline (died 1604), daughter of John Tresithney and his wife Joan Treffry.
