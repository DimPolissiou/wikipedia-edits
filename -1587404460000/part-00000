{"title_page": "Hermann Schaaffhausen", "text_new": "[[Image:Hermann Schaafhausen.jpg|thumb|Hermann Schaaffhausen]]\n'''Hermann Schaaffhausen''' (19 July 1816, [[Koblenz]] \u2013 26 January 1893, Bonn) was a German anatomist, anthropologist, and paleoanthropologist.\n\n==Biography==\n\nHermann Schaaffhausen was the son of Josef Hubert Schaaffhausen and Anna Maria Wachendorf.  He studied medicine at the [[University of Berlin]] and received his doctorate degree in 1839, and became a Professor of [[Anatomy]] at the [[University of Bonn]].  Schaaffhausen soon became involved in research in physical anthropology and the study of prehistoric humans in Europe.  He is best known for his study of the [[Neanderthal]] fossils (together with [[Johann Carl Fuhlrott|J.C. Fuhlrott]]). He was a member of several scientific societies, including the Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens (Natural History Society of the Rhineland and Westphalia) located in Bonn, the Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande (Association of the Friends of Antiquity in the Rhineland), and was an honorary member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte (German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory).  He became a member of the prestigious Kaiserlichen Leopoldinisch-Carolinischen Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher on 25 November 1873.  Schaafhausen served as co-editor of the influential journal ''Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropologie''.  He was also one of the founders of the Rheinischen Landesmuseums located in Bonn.   In addition to his scientific activities Schaaffhausen served as president of the Vereins der Rettung zur See (Association for Rescue at Sea).\n\nAlthough Darwin's theory of evolution was not yet published, Schaaffhausen discussed the idea of species evolving in an article titled \u201cUeber Best\u00e4ndigkeit und Umwandlung der Arten\u201d (On the Constancy and Transformation of Species) published in the ''Verhandlungen des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens'' (1853) in which he declared that \"the immutability of species...is not proven.\" In the third edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' published in 1861, [[Charles Darwin]] added a ''Historical Sketch'' that acknowledged the ideas of Schaaffhausen.<ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/origin/preface.html \"The Origin of Species\"]. Preface to the Third Edition.</ref>\n\nMany of his most important anthropological papers were collected and published in a book titled ''Anthropologische Studien'' (1885).\n\n== Schaaffhausen and the discovery of Neanderthal Man ==\n\nWorkmen quarrying the Feldhofer Grotte in the Neander Valley, near D\u00fcsseldorf in northern Germany, in 1856 unearthed human bones in the floor of the cave. A local schoolmaster Johann Carl Fuhlrott, who was interested in geology and paleontology, learned of the discovery and went to the site to collect the unusual bones. They consisted of the top portion of a skull, a clavicle and scapula, the right and left ulnae, a radius bone, the left hip bone, and the right and left femora. Fuhlrott was immediately struck by the fact that the bones appeared to be completely fossilized and the geological location of the bones in the cave, both suggesting that the bones were extremely old. Fuhlrott, recognizing the possible scientific significance of the find, brought the bones to Schaaffhausen in Bonn for analysis. Schaaffhausen was impressed by the primitive form of the skull and the evidence for their geological antiquity. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen presented papers on the fossils and the geology of the Feldhofer Cave at a meeting of the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Natur- und Heilkunde (Lower Rhine Society for Natural History and Medical Studies) in Bonn in 1857. Schaaffhausen published a paper on the Neanderthal fossils in the ''Archiv f\u00fcr Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin'' in 1858 and Fuhlrott published a paper in the ''Verhandlungen des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens'' in 1859 describing the geology of the site and how the bones were discovered. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen believed the Neanderthal fossils dated from the Glacial Period when extinct animals such as mammoths and the [[woolly rhinoceros]] still lived in Europe, which would make them among the oldest human remains known. This was before scientists believed humans lived during the Ice Age. Furthermore, Schaaffhausen noted that the Neanderthal skull differed from modern human skulls. He argued that the prominent bony ridges over the eyes and the general shape of the skull indicated that it belonged to a savage and barbarous race of human. Schaaffhausen concluded that the bones belonged to the original wild race of humans that lived in Europe before modern European peoples migrated into Europe in prehistoric times. The fossils generated considerable debate among anthropologists in Germany and abroad. The prominent German anthropologist Rudolf Virchow rejected Schaaffhausen's interpretation of the fossils, considering them the pathological remains of an ancient human. However, in 1864 [[William King (geologist)|William King]], professor of geology at Queens College in Galway, Ireland, presented a paper where he argued the Neanderthal fossils belonged to an extinct species of early human that he named ''Homo neanderthalensis''. Schaaffhausen continued to write on the Neanderthal fossils over the next two decades, comparing the bones with newly discovered Ice Age human fossils from Belgium, the [[Cro-magnon]] fossils from France, and Stone Age human bones from tombs across Europe.\n\n== Publications ==\n* ''\u00dcber Best\u00e4ndigkeit und Umwandlung der Arten''.

Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually, she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique.

Soon afterwards, she had a role in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). This was followed by ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and a leading role in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, \"I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy.\" She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]], and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. [[Don Siegel]], her director on ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), said of her: \"It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She's very, very hard.\"<ref>Patrick McGilligan, ''Clint: The Life and Legend'' (1999), p. 182</ref> At the peak of her success, she replaced [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964).

Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually, she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite \"beautifully constructed feet\" of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle.<ref name=\"MacLaine1996\">{{cite book|last=MacLaine|first=Shirley| title=My Lucky Stars: A Hollywood Memoir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSKjB8WWKoIC |accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=November 1, 1996|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-57233-9}}</ref> Also slowly realizing ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theater.\n\nShe attended [[Washington-Lee High School]], where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions.\n\n==Career==\n===1955\u20131979===\n[[Image:Shirley MacLaine in The Trouble With Harry trailer.jpg|thumb|MacLaine in her debut film ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955)]]\nThe summer before her senior year of high school, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, having minor success in the chorus of ''[[Oklahoma!]]''<ref name=\"sm biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/shirley-maclaine-9393367| title=Shirley MacLaine Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=December 4, 2018}}</ref>   After she graduated, she returned and was in the dancing ensemble of the Broadway production of ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953\u20131954).<ref>{{IBDB name}}</ref> Afterwards she became an understudy to actress [[Carol Haney]] in ''[[The Pajama Game]]''; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine replaced her.<ref>Finstad, Suzanne, ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man'' (2005, NY, Random House) page 106. The exact nature of Haney's injury - a sprain, a torn ligament, a break, a fracture - varies from source to source.</ref> A few months later, with Haney still injured, film producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nMacLaine made her film debut in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), for which she won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress]]. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film ''[[Artists and Models]]'' (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). This was followed by ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and a leading role in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, \"I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy.\" She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]], and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon.

Convicted February 15, 1996 - Armed robbery, attempted murder, possession of a deadly weapon. Sentence: 16 years, eligible for parole in nine. Granted early release in 1998. Returned as inmate #98J448, convicted July 20, 1998, on one count of 2nd degree murder. Sentence: 26 years, eligible for parole in 19.\"\n\nPoet is a [[heroin]] addict imprisoned for armed robbery and attempted murder. He composes and recites free verse poetry and regularly practices and performs in front of other inmates. He gets [[parole]]d early with the help of [[Kareem Sa\u00efd]] and [[Tim McManus]]. His freedom is short-lived, however, as he soon kills a drug dealer who came after him to collect the money he owed. When back in prison, he becomes a full-fledged member of the Homeboy gang, often acting as the second in command to whoever is in charge.\n\n==Season 1==\n\nPoet has a limited role in this season, often reciting poems for the other prisoners during mealtimes. His poems often reflect the social problems and political decisions which adversely affect [[African-American]] men and their wider communities, as well as everyday life in prison.\n\n==Season 2==\n\nLet back into Emerald City as one of the Homeboys, Poet is enrolled in the [[GED]] program in Oz. [[Tim McManus]], the unit manager of Em City, believes Poet is very talented and gets [[Muslim]] leader [[Kareem Sa\u00efd]] to help publish his work. He dedicates one of these poems to Kareem Said and another to the graduating classmates of his GED class while in prison. Poet does very well in the GED program, finishing at the top of the class even though he is made fun of frequently by [[Kenny Wangler]]. As a result, Poet is paroled early and sells several of his poems as a known author that are published in a book 'Unheard America'. However, Poet is still a heroin addict and spends all his profits on drugs. Drug dealers come after him to collect a debt at one of his book signings during his book promotional tour and he kills one of them in self-defense. However, since Poet was carrying a weapon without a permit and shot the dealer six times while on parole, he is in violation and sent back to Oz for murder-in-the-second-degree to serve twenty-six years.\n\nMcManus and Sa\u00efd are both disappointed and the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] congratulates Poet for messing up and getting sent back to Oz. While back inside as punishment, he must work in the morgue and is only accepted by [[Kenny Wangler]] and [[List of Oz (TV series) characters#Homeboys|Junior Pierce]].\n\n==Season 3==\n\nPoet is now referred to by his birth name of Arnold. Following the orders of [[Kenny Wangler]], their attempt to murder [[Simon Adebisi]] is put on hold under orders from [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] leader [[Antonio Nappa]]. Feeling guilty for wasting Said's efforts to have him paroled, a contrite Poet asks Said for permission to begin writing poetry again. Said gives Poet his blessing, but after Muslim [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]] beats Poet's friend and fellow homeboy, [[Kenny Wangler]], in boxing Poet publicly recites a sarcastic poem about Said's new relationship with a white woman. Because Said's behaviour has now become a public humiliation to the Muslims, he is eventually deposed and replaced by [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]].\n\nMeanwhile, when Wangler leaves temporarily to attend his girlfriend's funeral, Adebisi makes a deal with current Italian head [[Chucky Pancamo]] to take Wangler's spot in the drug trade. With the help of the Latinos, Adebisi burns Poet and Pierce with hot soup, putting them out of commission for a few weeks. When released from the infirmary, Poet and Pierce both have white spots all over their skin since the burn wounds burned off part of their flesh and caused a temporary change in complexion. Poet jokingly remarks \"I might be able to get a cab now\" since his skin for the time being appears whiter.\n\nIn Unit B, they tell Wangler that Adebisi must die but they are temporarily dissuaded when they learn that Adebisi is going to get [[Tim McManus]] replaced by an [[African American]] unit manager.\n\n==Season 4 Part I==\n\nPoet, Wangler, and Pierce are transferred back into Em City after Adebisi makes a request to Warden Glynn. Inside they torment a new inmate named [[Guillaume Tarrant]]. Adebisi puts a smuggled gun under Tarrant's bed, and the young man murders Wangler, Pierce, and a C.O., before turning the gun on himself. Poet is very upset that his best friends have died and Adebisi then suggests that Poet join him to take down all the white inmates. Poet remains loyal and as a result, when an [[African American]] named [[Martin Querns]] is hired in Tim McManus' position, things look up for Adebisi and his followers; they may do whatever they wish as long as there is no violence in Em City.\n\nSeveral transfers are made; mainly white and Latino inmates and guards being traded for blacks. Poet is asked to supervise [[Desmond Mobay]], a [[Jamaica]]n inmate wanting into the drug trade whom Adebisi does not trust. Poet and Supreme Allah are named trustees after the Italian and Latino inmates are transferred out of Em City. Poet becomes disgusted with what has happened in Em City under Adebisi's leadership (He is most disgusted by Adebisi's sexual behavior towards young black inmates) and secretly assists Sa\u00efd in taking him down. Homeboy member [[Leroy Tidd]] notices this and warns Adebisi, who decides to lie low until Sa\u00efd actually reveals what he is doing. Querns is fired and Adebisi dies when trying to kill Sa\u00efd, so Poet has now become the leader of the Homeboys by default.\n\n==Season 4 Part II==\n\nWhen a news crew comes to Oz, Poet makes statements that convince them that Oz is full of corruption. When inmate Burr Redding arrives, the older man informs Poet that he has been doing \"a shit job\" and convinces him to hand over leadership of the Homeboys. Unfazed, Poet willingly serves as Redding's lieutenant and sets up an attempted murder on Supreme Allah, who has been expelled from the Homeboys. Poet schedules a visit with [[Tug Daniels]], the brother of Supreme Allah's murder victim, and smuggles a knife made from a sharpened toothbrush into the visiting room. Allah narrowly survives Tug's attack, however; Daniels is sentenced to prison for attempted murder, and [[Warden Leo Glynn]] sends Poet, protesting his innocence, into solitary confinement as punishment for assisting Daniels.\n\nWhen Daniels arrives at Oz, he assists Poet and Redding in a plan to murder all the Italian and Latino inmates. However, a worried [[Augustus Hill]] tips off the authorities, the S.O.R.T. team is swiftly mobilized and the Homeboys plans are ruined, with Hill then expelled from the Homeboys. When Tug Daniels is later discovered to be conspiring with Supreme Allah against Redding, Poet pays off the guards to allow Redding to stage a [[kangaroo court]] that ends with Daniels' death. Hill approaches Poet with some information pertaining to Supreme Allah's weakness; he is allergic to eggs. In the cafeteria, they mix several eggs into Supreme's food, who then dies swiftly and painfully. Poet then tells Redding about their success, and Redding allows Hill back into the Homeboys.\n\n==Season 5==\n\nEm City is reopened and Poet is one of the Homeboys let back in. The Italians are taken down in a side battle with the Aryans. Redding calls a truce with [[Enrique Morales]] and the Latinos and agrees to work with them. Poet does not really like the Latinos and calls them [[Spic (slur)|spics]] behind their back. In the meantime, Redding gets control of the kitchen and the Italians removed so the Homeboys are now looking better. A guide dog program for the visually impaired then comes to Oz and Poet states his dislike for dogs being around him.\n\nA depressed Hill asks Poet and the Homeboys for some drugs. Hill accidentally snorts a lethal amount of heroin and goes into septic shock. Angry, Redding searches for the men responsible for drugging Hill and Poet is his first accusation. Poet lies, telling Burr to look at his enemies the Italians and Latinos instead of his friends among the Homeboys. Poet then uses Hill's [[overdose]] as an excuse to kill an Italian inmate as a means of drawing suspicion away from himself. With the help of Latino inmate [[Carmen Guerra]], Poet gets [[Agamemnon Busmalis]], a witness with no vested interest to lie about the Italians overdosing Hill. An Italian inmate named [[Salvatore DeSanto]] is falsely accused, and dies from an overdose of [[LSD]] Redding had put in his food. Hill then tells McManus that DeSanto did not give him the drugs and Poet, afraid for his life gets Busmalis to say the Latinos supplied Hill. The Latinos and Homeboys are no longer allied after the accusation is brought up and as a result, Morales now hates the black inmates.\n\nMeanwhile, Poet is paid by prison dentist [[Dr. Tariq Faraj]] to spread the word about a gum transplant that Aryan Brotherhood inmate [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]] receives. Amused by the fact that the gums are from a black man, Poet and [[Ryan O'Reily]] humiliate Robson in the cafeteria asking him first if he wants any \"Chitlins and Gravy\" with his lunch, then they announce that he got a pair of \"ghetto gums\" from the dentist. The Brotherhood is humiliated and kicks Robson out. Desperate to get back in with the Aryans, Robson buys cocaine from Poet, using it to numb the pain as he tries to remove his gums. The cocaine is woefully inadequate as a pain killer.\n\nAs Augustus leaves the hospital and Redding is released from the solitary ward, Poet then begs Hill not to inform on him, to which Hill agrees. Hill dies during an attempt on Redding's life made by the Italians and Latinos, who have reformed their alliance.\n\n==Season 6==\n\nThe Homeboys begin attacking inmates at random since Redding is too badly injured to lead them. Poet and fellow inmate [[Reggie Rawls]], among others, are constantly robbing inmates and trying to sell drugs to get the gang back under control. Redding then tells them they are going to leave the kitchen and work as [[telemarketer]]s. Poet, Rawls, and Kenaniah Maxwell, among others, are reluctant to do so. On the phones, Poet insults a woman for calling him a \"[[List of ethnic slurs|spook]]\" over the phone, and Redding fires him when he refuses to get back to work. The rest of the Homeboys follow Poet. Unknown to Poet, Redding requests that the Italians stop any drug transaction the Homeboys attempt to pull. This goes enforced as one of Poet's connections is run over 37 times by the Italians on orders of [[Chucky Pancamo]]. Poet then asks former [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member Jahfree Neema to lead them who refuses, saying the Homeboys give black people a bad name. Desperate for work, they go to [[Zahir Arif]] who is running the prison printing press.\n\nPoet and Rawls offer to help new inmate Stanley Bukowski sell marijuana, but the Italians discover this and kill Bukowski. Redding destroys the book industry and forces the Homeboys to come back and work as telemarketers. As they come back, Poet is forced to beg his way back in as a worker. Poet, however, saves the Homeboys when he develops a plan to steal [[credit card]] numbers and have his cousin sell them on the street and give the homeboys a cut.\n\nAt the end of the series he is last shown evacuating Oswald with the rest of the prison population. His survival establishes himself as the last of the original members of the Homeboys and one of the few inmates who survived the entire series run and had been in Oz prior to the beginning of the series.\n\n===Murders committed===\n\n* '''Unknown dealer''' - Shot six times while on parole, then got sent back to Oz.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822000745/http://www.hbo.com/oz/cast/character_poet.shtml Official character biography at Oz website]\n\n{{Oz (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arnold Poet Jackson}}\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n[[Category:Fictional bullies|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n[[Category:Fictional inmates in American federal prisons]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n[[Category:Fictional poets|Poet]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug dealers|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n[[Category:Fictional gangsters|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Oz (TV series) characters|Jackson, Arnold \"Poet\"]]\n", "text_old": "{{MI|\n{{Original research|article|date=February 2008}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=February 2008}}\n}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Poet_Oz.JPG|thumb|Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson]] -->'''Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson''', played by [[muMs da Schemer]], is a fictional character in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.\n\n==Character overview==\n\"Prisoner #96J352.

Returned as inmate #98J448, convicted July 20, 1998, on one count of 2nd degree murder. Sentence: 26 years, eligible for parole in 19.\"\n\nPoet is a [[heroin]] addict imprisoned for armed robbery and attempted murder. He composes and recites free verse poetry and regularly practices and performs in front of other inmates. He gets [[parole]]d early with the help of [[Kareem Sa\u00efd]] and [[Tim McManus]]. His freedom is short-lived, however, as he soon kills a drug dealer who came after him to collect the money he owed. When back in prison, he becomes a full-fledged member of the Homeboy gang, often acting as the second in command to whoever is in charge.\n\n==Season 1==\n\nPoet has a limited role in this season, often reciting poems for the other prisoners during mealtimes. His poems often reflect the social problems and political decisions which adversely affect [[African-American]] men and their wider communities, as well as everyday life in prison.\n\n==Season 2==\n\nLet back into Emerald City as one of the Homeboys, Poet is enrolled in the [[GED]] program in Oz. [[Tim McManus]], the unit manager of Em City, believes Poet is very talented and gets [[Muslim]] leader [[Kareem Sa\u00efd]] to help publish his work. He dedicates one of these poems to Kareem Said and another to the graduating classmates of his GED class while in prison. Poet does very well in the GED program, finishing at the top of the class even though he is made fun of frequently by [[Kenny Wangler]]. As a result, Poet is paroled early and sells several of his poems as a known author that are published in a book 'Unheard America'. However, Poet is still a heroin addict and spends all his profits on drugs. Drug dealers come after him to collect a debt at one of his book signings during his book promotional tour and he kills one of them in self-defense. However, since Poet was carrying a weapon without a permit and shot the dealer six times while on parole, he is in violation and sent back to Oz for murder-in-the-second-degree to serve twenty-six years.\n\nMcManus and Sa\u00efd are both disappointed and the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] congratulates Poet for messing up and getting sent back to Oz.

Most of the maintained grammar schools were closed or converted to [[comprehensive schools]] in the 1960s and 1970s, though a few local authorities resisted this move and retained a selective system.\nThere are also a number of isolated grammar schools, which admit the candidates who score highest on their entry tests.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J\u00f6rn-Steffen |last=Pischke |first2=Alan |last2=Manning |title=Comprehensive versus Selective Schooling in England in Wales: What Do We Know? |date=April 2006 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 12176 |doi=10.3386/w12176 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite paper\n |title       = The impact of the structure of secondary education in Slough\n |first1      = Ian\n |last1       = Schagen\n |first2      = Sandy\n |last2       = Schagen\n |date        = November 2001\n |publisher   = [[National Foundation for Educational Research]]\n |url         = http://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/other-publications/downloadable-reports/pdf_docs/slsfinalreport.pdf\n |accessdate  = 2008-03-20\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081003105857/http://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/other-publications/downloadable-reports/pdf_docs/slsfinalreport.pdf\n |archivedate = 2008-10-03\n}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining 163 English state grammar schools are listed here grouped by [[Regions of England|region]] (from north to south) and [[Local Education Authority]].\nThere are no remaining state grammar schools in [[North East England]].\nThe gender indicated is that of the main school (ages 11\u201316).
