Rescue by a German helicopter came a week later, but the chief officer was mistakenly left behind. Due to difficulties with wind, transportation, and communication, the officer was not returned to mainland Yemen until September. He described the island as \"A hellish place, where time stands still, and one can feel completely alone in the world.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri.jpg|Native dwellings (1903)\nFile:View of the 'Strath' and Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri.jpg|View of the 'Strath' and Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri, 1898\n</gallery>\n==Map==\n[[File:Topographic map of Socotra-en.svg|thumb|600px|center|Topographic map of Socotra archipielago; Abd al-Kuri at bottom left]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book|author=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|author-link=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|year=2007|title= Sailing Directions - Enroute |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=gQ-7FF8gp5oC|location=|publisher=ProStar Publications|ref=NGA2007}}\n* {{Cite book|year=1878|title= Nautical magazine, Volume 47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5AEAAAAQAAJ&dq=abd+al+kuri&source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= London|publisher=Brown, Son, and Ferguson|ref=NM1878}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Redman, Nigel|author2=Fanshawe, John|author3=Stevenson, Terry|year=2009|title= Birds of the Horn of Africa: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Socotra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofMlZKqOlisC&dq=abd+al+kuri&source=gbs_navlinks_s|location=|publisher=A&C Black|ref=A&C2009}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Sch\u00fcrmann, H.

Rescue by a German helicopter came a week later, but the chief officer was mistakenly left behind. Due to difficulties with wind, transportation, and communication, the officer was not returned to mainland Yemen until September. He described the island as \"A hellish place, where time stands still, and one can feel completely alone in the world.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri.jpg|Native dwellings (1903)\nFile:View of the 'Strath' and Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri.jpg|View of the 'Strath' and Native Dwellings, Abd-el-Kuri, 1898\n</gallery>\n==Map==\n[[File:Topographic map of Socotra-en.svg|thumb|600px|center|Topographic map of Socotra archipielago; Abd al-Kuri at bottom left]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book|author=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|author-link=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|year=2007|title= Sailing Directions - Enroute |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=gQ-7FF8gp5oC|location=|publisher=ProStar Publications|ref=NGA2007}}\n* {{Cite book|year=1878|title= Nautical magazine, Volume 47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5AEAAAAQAAJ&dq=abd+al+kuri&source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= London|publisher=Brown, Son, and Ferguson|ref=NM1878}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Redman, Nigel|author2=Fanshawe, John|author3=Stevenson, Terry|year=2009|title= Birds of the Horn of Africa: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Socotra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofMlZKqOlisC&dq=abd+al+kuri&source=gbs_navlinks_s|location=|publisher=A&C Black|ref=A&C2009}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Sch\u00fcrmann, H.

Their presence in Florida is attributed to a writer from [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state.\n\nNo live or dead specimens are known, but many sightings considered credible by biologists have been reported. The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at about two years of age, and have lived for up to 10 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002. The megareserves of the [[Amazon Basin]] are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations.<ref name=iucn/>\nIt is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but is suffering decline due to loss of habitat.

While commonly inhabiting lowlands, it has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Occasionally it also occurs in dense tropical areas. Their home range is widely variable, depending on the local environment; individuals have been reported as ranging over territories from {{convert|6.8|to|100|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Introduced range===\nJaguarundis have been sighted in [[Florida]] since the early 20th century. Here, the species is assumed to have been [[introduced species|introduced]], but it is not known when the introduction occurred. Their presence in Florida is attributed to a writer from [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state.\n\nNo live or dead specimens are known, but many sightings considered credible by biologists have been reported. The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at about two years of age, and have lived for up to 10 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002. The megareserves of the [[Amazon Basin]] are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations.<ref name=iucn/>\nIt is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but is suffering decline due to loss of habitat. The [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] has expressed concern that its presence in South Texas may be imperiled due to loss of the cat's native habitat.<ref name=Texas2003>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/land/habitats/southtx_plain/endangered_species/ |title=Endangered Species |website=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=2003-04-15 |access-date=2011-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe North and Central American populations of the jaguarundi are listed in [[CITES Appendix I]].

According to tradition, in [[Protohistory of Ireland|ancient Ireland]] it was one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|fifths]] ({{lang-ga|c\u00faige}}) ruled by a ''[[R\u00ed#R\u00ed ruirech|r\u00ed ruirech]]'', or \"king of over-kings\". It is named after the overkingdom of [[Ulaid]], in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were [[Airg\u00edalla]] and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|Ailech]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 12th century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the [[Anglo-Normans]] and became the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. By the late 14th century the Earldom had collapsed and the [[O'Neill dynasty]] had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title [[List of kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland's provinces. Its rulers resisted [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English encroachment]] but were defeated in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). King [[James VI and I|James I]] then colonized Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Great Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] violence with Catholics, notably during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and the [[Armagh disturbances]]. Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1801. In the early 20th century, moves towards [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish self-rule]] were opposed by many [[Ulster Protestants]], sparking the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. This, and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]], led to the [[partition of Ireland]]. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], now the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' has no official function for local government purposes in either country. However, for the purposes of [[ISO 3166-2]], ''Ulster'' is used to refer to the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan only, which are given country sub-division code \"IE-U\".<ref>ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-1, 19 February 2010, which gives \"Ulster\" as the official English name and \"Ulaidh\" as the official Irish name of the province, citing \"Ordnance Survey Office, Dublin 1993\" as its source \u2013 [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf]</ref> The name is also used by various organisations such as cultural and sporting bodies.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe [[Place names in Irish|name]] ''Ulster'' has several possible derivations: from the [[Norse language|Norse]] name \u2018Uladztir\u2019, which is an adaptation of ''Ulaidh'' and ''tir'', the [[Irish language|Irish]] for \u2019land\u2019;<ref name=\"Bardon\">Jonathan Bardon; ''A History of Ulster'', page 27.

The province's highest point, [[Slieve Donard]] ({{convert|848|m|ft}}), stands in County Down. The most northerly point in Ireland, [[Malin Head]], is in County Donegal, as are the sixth-highest ({{convert|601|m|ft}}) sea [[cliffs]] in Europe, at [[Slieve League]], and the province's largest island, [[Arranmore]]. The most easterly point in Ireland is also in Ulster, in [[County Down]], and the most westerly point in the UK is in [[County Fermanagh]]. The longest river in the British Isles, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], rises at the [[Shannon Pot]] in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the [[Antrim Plateau]] and the [[Giant's Causeway]], one of Ireland's three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Ulster also has a significant [[drumlin]] belt.  The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] and [[Carrickmore]] in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:House through the Arch.jpg|At White Park Bay\nFile:Countryside west of Ballynahinch - geograph.org.uk - 466768.jpg|Countryside west of Ballynahinch\nFile:Mourne country cottage. - geograph.org.uk - 495183.jpg|Mourne country cottage\nFile:Downshire Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 645687.jpg|Downshire Bridge Crossing the bay to Murlough\nFile:Cattle near Six Road Ends - geograph.org.uk - 435763.jpg|Cattle near Six Road Ends Seen from the Kirkistown to Ballyeaseborough Road\nFile:The Twelve Arches near Dundrum - geograph.org.uk - 442408.jpg|The Twelve Arches near Dundrum\nFile:Fintown Railway on trackbed of CDR County Donegal Railway, Lough Finn (5951398952).jpg|The track of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC)]] restored next to [[Lough Finn]], near [[Fintown railway station|Fintown station]].\nFile:Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich. - geograph.org.uk - 452580.jpg|Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich\nFile:The approach of autumn, Tardree forest - geograph.org.uk - 943055.jpg|The approach of autumn, Tardree forest\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Air===\nThe province's main airport is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at [[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]], 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] (sometimes referred to as \"the City Airport\" or \"the Harbour Airport\") is another, smaller airport which is located at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in Belfast.

Its [[Place names in Irish|name]] derives from the [[Irish language]] ''C\u00faige Uladh'' (pronounced \"Kooi-gah UH-loo\"), meaning \"fifth of the [[Ulaid]]h\", named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe province's early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the [[Ulster Cycle]].\nThe [[archaeology]] of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of \"ritual enclosures\", such as the \"Giant's Ring\" near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590&nbsp;feet (180 m) in diameter and 15&nbsp;feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a [[dolmen]].<ref name=\"Riordain 66\">{{cite book|last=Riordain|first=S.

The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Conghal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.\n\nIn early medieval Ireland, a branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] of the province of [[Ailech]], gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the [[River Bann]]. The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain would make T\u00edr E\u00f3ghain (most of which forms modern [[County Tyrone]]) their base. Among the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] were [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] (died 879), [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (died 919), and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]] (died 980), all of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], when the [[O'Neill]]s who had come to dominate the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of \"king of Ulster\" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.\n\n[[File:Bronze statue - geograph.org.uk - 821113.jpg|260px|thumb|A bronze statue commemorating The [[Flight of the Earls]] at [[Rathmullan]] in north [[County Donegal]].]]\n[[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] (died 1121) and [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The [[Meic Lochlainn]] were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (see [[O'Neill dynasty]]). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.\n\nThe \u00d3 Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O'Donnells ruled over [[T\u00edr Chonaill]] (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.\n\nAfter the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first [[John de Courcy|De Courcy]] (died 1219), then [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] (1176\u20131243), who founded the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]] based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.\n\nIn the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1594\u20131603) at the [[battle of Kinsale]] (1601), [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.\n\nThe Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]] and [[O'Donnell]]s, finding their power under English [[suzerainty]] limited, decamped ''en masse'' in 1607 (the [[Flight of the Earls]]) to [[Roman Catholic]] Europe. This allowed the [[British monarchy|English Crown]] to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish [[Plantations of Ireland|planter]]s, a process which began in earnest in 1610.\n\n===Plantations and civil wars===\n<!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.\n-->\nThe [[Plantation of Ulster]] ({{lang-gle|Pland\u00e1il Uladh}}) was the organised [[colonisation]] (or [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially [[Presbyterians]] from [[Scotland]]).

This Rebellion was initially led by [[Phelim O'Neill|Sir Phelim O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Sir F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill''), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing [[Irish Confederate Wars|wars]] (1641\u20131653, fought against the background of [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war]] in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Eoghan Ruadh \u00d3 N\u00e9ill'') inflicted a defeat on a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army at [[battle of Benburb|Benburb]] in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near Newmills on the western outskirts of [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], in 1650, as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] conducted by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[New Model Army]], the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro100.shtml|title=BBC Short History}}</ref>\n\nForty years later, in 1688\u20131691, the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] was fought, the belligerents of which were the [[Williamite]]s and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the [[British Throne]], and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent [[British Empire]]. However, the war was also a part of the greater [[War of the Grand Alliance]], fought between [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], led by [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire]], supported by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom [[James II of England|King James II]] was allied.\n\nThe majority of Irish people were \"Jacobites\" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6\u2013111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|jstor = 30064327}}</ref> However, James II was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the majority of Ulster [[Colonialists]] ([[Williamite]]s) backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. It is of note that both the Williamite and Jacobite armies were religiously mixed; William of Orange's own elite forces, the [[Dutch Blue Guards]] had a papal banner with them during the invasion, many of them being Dutch Roman Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rabushka|first=Alvin|year=2008|title=Taxation in Colonial America, 1607\u20131775|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/taxatio_rab_2008_00_1086/page/279 279]|isbn=978-0-691-13345-4|url=https://archive.org/details/taxatio_rab_2008_00_1086/page/279}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the war, Irish Jacobites controlled most of Ireland for James II, with the exception of the Williamite strongholds at [[Derry]] and at [[Enniskillen]] in Ulster. The Jacobites [[Siege of Derry|besieged Derry]] from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the [[battle of Newtownbutler]] on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] with the iconic victories of the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1 July 1690) and the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (12 July 1691), all of which the [[Orange Order]] commemorate each year.\n\nThe Williamites' victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland excluded most of Ulster's population from having any Civil [[power (sociology)|power]] on religious grounds. [[Roman Catholics]] (descended from the indigenous Irish) and [[Presbyterians]] (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which gave full political rights only to [[Anglican]] Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.\n\n===Emigration===\nConsiderable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).\n\nDisdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the \"western mountains,\" where their descendants populated the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions and the [[Ohio Valley]]. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Author (and US Senator) [[Jim Webb]] puts forth a thesis in his book ''Born Fighting'' to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.\n\nIn the [[United States Census, 2000]], 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.  The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as \"American\" with no further qualification (e.g. [[Kentucky]], north-central [[Texas]], and many other areas in the [[Southern US]]) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans.  According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMost of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to [[British North America]] in this period, where they became known as \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scots Irish]]\" or \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPolitical tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], in opposition to [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican domination]] and inspired by the American and French [[revolutions]] joined together in the [[United Irishmen]] movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-[[sectarian]] and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]]. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the \"[[Battle of the Diamond]]\" in 1795, a faction fight between the rival \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\" (Roman Catholic) and \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\" (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern [[Connacht]]. These refugees' linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which have many similarities to [[Ulster Irish]] not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], also used violence against the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] and against Roman Catholic and Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] throughout the province.\n\nIn 1798 the United Irishmen, led by [[Henry Joy McCracken]], launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800, [[Presbyterians]] came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.\n\nThe [[1859 Ulster Revival]] was a major [[Christian revival]] that spread throughout Ulster.\n\n===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===\n[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890\u20131900.]]\nIn the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island.  In the latter part of the century, [[Belfast]] briefly overtook [[Dublin]] as the island's largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge [[dockyard]]s and [[shipbuilding]] \u2014 and notably for the construction of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Sectarian]] divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of ''[[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]'' (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and ''[[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]'' (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland's current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland, and which Ulster Protestants usually opposed\u2014fearing for their religious rights calling it \"Rome Rule\" in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southern most region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/32717516/1919-Cork-Its-Trade-and-Commerce| pg 168</ref>\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|230px|right|The results of the [[1918 Irish general election]], in which [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] won the majority of votes on the island of Ireland, shown in the color green and light green respectively, with the exception being primarily in the East of the province of Ulster.]]\nThousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister [[Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], signed the \"[[Ulster Covenant]]\" of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 [[Imperial Germany|German]] rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at [[Larne]] by blockading authorities.  (See [[Larne gunrunning]]). The [[Curragh Incident]] showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster's unionist minority.\n\nIn response, Irish republicans created the [[Irish Volunteers]], part of which became the forerunner of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) \u2014 to seek to ensure the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Upon the outbreak of [[Ireland and World War I|World War I]] in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the [[British Army]]. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend [[conscription]] to all able bodied Irishmen during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Conscription Crisis]].\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the political party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (\"Ourselves\") won the majority of votes in the [[1918 Irish general election]], this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the [[Sinn F\u00e9in Manifesto 1918|Sinn F\u00e9in campaign Manifesto of 1918]], a great deal more than the devolved government/[[Home Rule]] advocated by the (I.P.P) [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Following the Sinn F\u00e9in victory in these elections the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] was penned and [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republicans]] launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the [[Irish War of Independence]] (January 1919 \u2013 July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south [[County Armagh|Armagh]] area, where [[Frank Aiken]] led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in [[County Donegal]] and the City of [[Derry]], where one of the main Republican leaders was [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. Hugh O'Doherty, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the [[First D\u00e1il]], which was elected in late 1918, Prof. [[Eoin Mac N\u00e9ill]] served as the Sinn F\u00e9in T.D. for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]].\n\n===1920 to present===\n{{main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n{{see also|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[Partition of Ireland]], first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], which gave a form of \"Home rule\" self-government to two areas, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]], with its capital at [[Dublin]], and \"[[Northern Ireland]]\", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Dissatisfaction with this led to the [[Irish War of Independence]], which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]] (which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Ireland]]), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.\n\nFollowing the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future [[Northern Ireland]], if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the [[Irish Boundary Commission]]. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster's nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.\n\nElectorally, voting in the six [[Northern Ireland]] counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large [[Protestant]] minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party [[Fine Gael]] (\"Family of the Irish\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlass.com/intel/archives/006991.html |title=The Future's Bright For Donegal's Orangemen |accessdate=6 June 2008 |publisher=Independent News And Media |date=11 July 2004 }}</ref> However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a [[Church of Ireland]] member and [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as [[President of Ireland|President]] after having served as a long-term minister under [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and [[Jack Lynch]].\n\nThe [[Orange Order]] freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the [[Republic of Ireland]] takes place every July in the village of [[Rossnowlagh]], near [[Ballyshannon]], in the south of County Donegal.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn F\u00e9in (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.'s to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.'s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.'s to the D\u00e1il (one of whom is a Protestant).\n\nThe historic [[Flag of Ulster]] served as the basis for the [[Ulster Banner]] (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] until the proroguing of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament in 1973.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nWilliam Sherard (1659\u20131728) was the first biologist in Ulster.<ref>Deane, C.D. 1983.

In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]]. Hurling teams play in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], [[National Hurling League]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the [[Railway Cup]] in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]], [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]], [[Derry GAA|Derry]], and [[Down GAA|Down]].\n\nThe border has divided association football teams since 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=47|title=Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}</ref> The [[Irish Football Association]] (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place ([[Irish Football League]] in Northern Ireland, [[League of Ireland]] in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, [[Derry City F.C.]] has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is [[Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a 'North-West Derby'. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the [[Setanta Sports Cup]].\n\nIn [[Rugby union]], the professional rugby team representing the province and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] Ulster Branch, [[Ulster Rugby]], compete in the [[Pro14]] along with teams from [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces ([[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] and [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]]). They also compete in Europe's main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, [[Jack Kyle]] and [[Mike Gibson (rugby union)|Mike Gibson]]. The former is the most capped [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the Irish national team. They do not sing the Irish national anthem but do sing a special song which has been written celebrating the \"4 proud provinces\" before matches start.\n\nThe [[Ulster Hockey Union]] organises [[field hockey]] in the province and contributes substantially to the all-island hockey team.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/50209912 | title = Ireland hockey: Seven Ulster players in squad for Olympic qualifier against Canada | work = BBC Sport | date = 28 October 2019 | accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=cricket+belfast+protestant|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|first1=John|last1=McGarry|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|date=8 June 1995|publisher=Wiley|via=Google Books|isbn=9780631183495}}</ref> Ulster enters two teams into the [[Cricket in Ireland#Inter-Provincial Series|Interprovincial Series]]; the [[Northern Knights (cricket team)|North Knights]] and the [[North West Warriors]], who are the respective representative teams of the [[Northern Cricket Union]] (NCU) and the [[North West Cricket Union]] (NWCU).\n\nGolf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other.

Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], making up almost half of its population. English is the main language and [[Ulster English]] the main dialect. A minority also speak Irish, and there are [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking regions) in southern County Londonderry, the Gaeltacht Quarter of Belfast and in Donegal, where 25% of the total Gaeltacht population of Ireland is located.<ref>{{cite web | title=Results | website=census.cso.ie | url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&Geog_Code=02 | access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> [[Lough Neagh]], in the east, is the largest lake in the [[British Isles]], while [[Lough Erne]] in the west is one of its largest lake networks. The main mountain ranges are the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]], [[Sperrins]], [[Blue Stack Mountains|Croaghgorms]] and [[Derryveagh Mountains]].\n\nHistorically, Ulster lay at the heart of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world made up of [[Gaelic Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. According to tradition, in [[Protohistory of Ireland|ancient Ireland]] it was one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|fifths]] ({{lang-ga|c\u00faige}}) ruled by a ''[[R\u00ed#R\u00ed ruirech|r\u00ed ruirech]]'', or \"king of over-kings\". It is named after the overkingdom of [[Ulaid]], in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were [[Airg\u00edalla]] and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|Ailech]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 12th century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the [[Anglo-Normans]] and became the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. By the late 14th century the Earldom had collapsed and the [[O'Neill dynasty]] had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title [[List of kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland's provinces. Its rulers resisted [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English encroachment]] but were defeated in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). King [[James VI and I|James I]] then colonized Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Great Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] violence with Catholics, notably during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and the [[Armagh disturbances]]. Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1801. In the early 20th century, moves towards [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish self-rule]] were opposed by many [[Ulster Protestants]], sparking the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. This, and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]], led to the [[partition of Ireland]]. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], now the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' has no official function for local government purposes in either country. However, for the purposes of [[ISO 3166-2]], ''Ulster'' is used to refer to the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan only, which are given country sub-division code \"IE-U\".<ref>ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-1, 19 February 2010, which gives \"Ulster\" as the official English name and \"Ulaidh\" as the official Irish name of the province, citing \"Ordnance Survey Office, Dublin 1993\" as its source \u2013 [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf]</ref> The name is also used by various organisations such as cultural and sporting bodies.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe [[Place names in Irish|name]] ''Ulster'' has several possible derivations: from the [[Norse language|Norse]] name \u2018Uladztir\u2019, which is an adaptation of ''Ulaidh'' and ''tir'', the [[Irish language|Irish]] for \u2019land\u2019;<ref name=\"Bardon\">Jonathan Bardon; ''A History of Ulster'', page 27.

Gill & Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7171-6207-9}}</ref> It has also been suggested to have derived from ''Uladh'' plus the Norse suffix ''ster'' (meaning place), which was common in the [[Shetland Islands]] and [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/wordsandplaceso04taylgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/wordsandplaceso04taylgoog/page/n222 182] |author=Rev.

About 62% of the area of Ulster is in the UK while the remaining 38% is in the Republic of Ireland. Ulster's biggest city, [[Belfast]], has an urban population of over half a million inhabitants, making it the [[List of settlements on the island of Ireland by population|second-largest city on the island of Ireland]] and the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|10th largest urban area]] in the UK. <!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry. \n-->\nSix of Ulster's nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], including the former parliamentary boroughs of [[Belfast]] and [[Londonderry (parliamentary borough)|Londonderry]], form [[Northern Ireland]] which remained part of the United Kingdom after the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921. Three Ulster counties \u2013 [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] \u2013 form part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. About half of Ulster's population lives in counties Antrim and Down. Across the nine counties, according to the aggregate UK [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] for Northern Ireland, and the ROI 2011 Census for counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, there is a [[Roman Catholic]] majority over [[Protestant]] of 50.8% to 42.7%.<ref>\"Community Background\", 2011 Census, for NI, and \"Religion\", 2011 Census, for RoI</ref>\n\nWhile the traditional counties continue to demarcate areas of [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]], this is no longer the case in Northern Ireland. Since 1974, the traditional counties have a [[ceremonial county|ceremonial]] role only.

The province's highest point, [[Slieve Donard]] ({{convert|848|m|ft}}), stands in County Down. The most northerly point in Ireland, [[Malin Head]], is in County Donegal, as are the sixth-highest ({{convert|601|m|ft}}) sea [[cliffs]] in Europe, at [[Slieve League]], and the province's largest island, [[Arranmore]]. The most easterly point in Ireland is also in Ulster, in [[County Down]], and the most westerly point in the UK is in [[County Fermanagh]]. The longest river in the British Isles, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], rises at the [[Shannon Pot]] in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the [[Antrim Plateau]] and the [[Giant's Causeway]], one of Ireland's three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Ulster also has a significant [[drumlin]] belt.  The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] and [[Carrickmore]] in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:House through the Arch.jpg|At White Park Bay\nFile:Countryside west of Ballynahinch - geograph.org.uk - 466768.jpg|Countryside west of Ballynahinch\nFile:Mourne country cottage. - geograph.org.uk - 495183.jpg|Mourne country cottage\nFile:Downshire Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 645687.jpg|Downshire Bridge Crossing the bay to Murlough\nFile:Cattle near Six Road Ends - geograph.org.uk - 435763.jpg|Cattle near Six Road Ends Seen from the Kirkistown to Ballyeaseborough Road\nFile:The Twelve Arches near Dundrum - geograph.org.uk - 442408.jpg|The Twelve Arches near Dundrum\nFile:Fintown Railway on trackbed of CDR County Donegal Railway, Lough Finn (5951398952).jpg|The track of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC)]] restored next to [[Lough Finn]], near [[Fintown railway station|Fintown station]].\nFile:Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich. - geograph.org.uk - 452580.jpg|Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich\nFile:The approach of autumn, Tardree forest - geograph.org.uk - 943055.jpg|The approach of autumn, Tardree forest\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Air===\nThe province's main airport is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at [[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]], 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] (sometimes referred to as \"the City Airport\" or \"the Harbour Airport\") is another, smaller airport which is located at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in Belfast. The [[City of Derry Airport]] is located at [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]], {{convert|13|km|mi|0}} east of the city of [[Derry]].

Its [[Place names in Irish|name]] derives from the [[Irish language]] ''C\u00faige Uladh'' (pronounced \"Kooi-gah UH-loo\"), meaning \"fifth of the [[Ulaid]]h\", named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe province's early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the [[Ulster Cycle]].\nThe [[archaeology]] of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of \"ritual enclosures\", such as the \"Giant's Ring\" near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590&nbsp;feet (180 m) in diameter and 15&nbsp;feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a [[dolmen]].<ref name=\"Riordain 66\">{{cite book|last=Riordain|first=S.

The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Conghal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.\n\nIn early medieval Ireland, a branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] of the province of [[Ailech]], gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the [[River Bann]]. The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain would make T\u00edr E\u00f3ghain (most of which forms modern [[County Tyrone]]) their base. Among the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] were [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] (died 879), [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (died 919), and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]] (died 980), all of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], when the [[O'Neill]]s who had come to dominate the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of \"king of Ulster\" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.\n\n[[File:Bronze statue - geograph.org.uk - 821113.jpg|260px|thumb|A bronze statue commemorating The [[Flight of the Earls]] at [[Rathmullan]] in north [[County Donegal]].]]\n[[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] (died 1121) and [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The [[Meic Lochlainn]] were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (see [[O'Neill dynasty]]). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.\n\nThe \u00d3 Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O'Donnells ruled over [[T\u00edr Chonaill]] (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.\n\nAfter the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first [[John de Courcy|De Courcy]] (died 1219), then [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] (1176\u20131243), who founded the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]] based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.\n\nIn the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1594\u20131603) at the [[battle of Kinsale]] (1601), [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.\n\nThe Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]] and [[O'Donnell]]s, finding their power under English [[suzerainty]] limited, decamped ''en masse'' in 1607 (the [[Flight of the Earls]]) to [[Roman Catholic]] Europe. This allowed the [[British monarchy|English Crown]] to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish [[Plantations of Ireland|planter]]s, a process which began in earnest in 1610.\n\n===Plantations and civil wars===\n<!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.\n-->\nThe [[Plantation of Ulster]] ({{lang-gle|Pland\u00e1il Uladh}}) was the organised [[colonisation]] (or [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially [[Presbyterians]] from [[Scotland]]).

This Rebellion was initially led by [[Phelim O'Neill|Sir Phelim O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Sir F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill''), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing [[Irish Confederate Wars|wars]] (1641\u20131653, fought against the background of [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war]] in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Eoghan Ruadh \u00d3 N\u00e9ill'') inflicted a defeat on a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army at [[battle of Benburb|Benburb]] in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near Newmills on the western outskirts of [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], in 1650, as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] conducted by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[New Model Army]], the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro100.shtml|title=BBC Short History}}</ref>\n\nForty years later, in 1688\u20131691, the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] was fought, the belligerents of which were the [[Williamite]]s and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the [[British Throne]], and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent [[British Empire]]. However, the war was also a part of the greater [[War of the Grand Alliance]], fought between [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], led by [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire]], supported by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom [[James II of England|King James II]] was allied.\n\nThe majority of Irish people were \"Jacobites\" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6\u2013111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|jstor = 30064327}}</ref> However, James II was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the majority of Ulster [[Colonialists]] ([[Williamite]]s) backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]].

The Jacobites [[Siege of Derry|besieged Derry]] from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the [[battle of Newtownbutler]] on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] with the iconic victories of the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1 July 1690) and the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (12 July 1691), all of which the [[Orange Order]] commemorate each year.\n\nThe Williamites' victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland excluded most of Ulster's population from having any Civil [[power (sociology)|power]] on religious grounds. [[Roman Catholics]] (descended from the indigenous Irish) and [[Presbyterians]] (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which gave full political rights only to [[Anglican]] Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.\n\n===Emigration===\nConsiderable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).\n\nDisdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the \"western mountains,\" where their descendants populated the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions and the [[Ohio Valley]]. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Author (and US Senator) [[Jim Webb]] puts forth a thesis in his book ''Born Fighting'' to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.\n\nIn the [[United States Census, 2000]], 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.  The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as \"American\" with no further qualification (e.g. [[Kentucky]], north-central [[Texas]], and many other areas in the [[Southern US]]) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans.  According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMost of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to [[British North America]] in this period, where they became known as \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scots Irish]]\" or \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPolitical tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], in opposition to [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican domination]] and inspired by the American and French [[revolutions]] joined together in the [[United Irishmen]] movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-[[sectarian]] and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]]. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the \"[[Battle of the Diamond]]\" in 1795, a faction fight between the rival \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\" (Roman Catholic) and \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\" (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern [[Connacht]]. These refugees' linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which have many similarities to [[Ulster Irish]] not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], also used violence against the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] and against Roman Catholic and Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] throughout the province.\n\nIn 1798 the United Irishmen, led by [[Henry Joy McCracken]], launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800, [[Presbyterians]] came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.\n\nThe [[1859 Ulster Revival]] was a major [[Christian revival]] that spread throughout Ulster.\n\n===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===\n[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890\u20131900.]]\nIn the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island.  In the latter part of the century, [[Belfast]] briefly overtook [[Dublin]] as the island's largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge [[dockyard]]s and [[shipbuilding]] \u2014 and notably for the construction of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Sectarian]] divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of ''[[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]'' (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and ''[[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]'' (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland's current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland, and which Ulster Protestants usually opposed\u2014fearing for their religious rights calling it \"Rome Rule\" in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southern most region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/32717516/1919-Cork-Its-Trade-and-Commerce| pg 168</ref>\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|230px|right|The results of the [[1918 Irish general election]], in which [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] won the majority of votes on the island of Ireland, shown in the color green and light green respectively, with the exception being primarily in the East of the province of Ulster.]]\nThousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister [[Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], signed the \"[[Ulster Covenant]]\" of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 [[Imperial Germany|German]] rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at [[Larne]] by blockading authorities.  (See [[Larne gunrunning]]). The [[Curragh Incident]] showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster's unionist minority.\n\nIn response, Irish republicans created the [[Irish Volunteers]], part of which became the forerunner of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) \u2014 to seek to ensure the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Upon the outbreak of [[Ireland and World War I|World War I]] in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the [[British Army]]. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend [[conscription]] to all able bodied Irishmen during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Conscription Crisis]].\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the political party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (\"Ourselves\") won the majority of votes in the [[1918 Irish general election]], this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the [[Sinn F\u00e9in Manifesto 1918|Sinn F\u00e9in campaign Manifesto of 1918]], a great deal more than the devolved government/[[Home Rule]] advocated by the (I.P.P) [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Following the Sinn F\u00e9in victory in these elections the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] was penned and [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republicans]] launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the [[Irish War of Independence]] (January 1919 \u2013 July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south [[County Armagh|Armagh]] area, where [[Frank Aiken]] led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in [[County Donegal]] and the City of [[Derry]], where one of the main Republican leaders was [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. Hugh O'Doherty, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the [[First D\u00e1il]], which was elected in late 1918, Prof. [[Eoin Mac N\u00e9ill]] served as the Sinn F\u00e9in T.D. for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]].\n\n===1920 to present===\n{{main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n{{see also|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[Partition of Ireland]], first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], which gave a form of \"Home rule\" self-government to two areas, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]], with its capital at [[Dublin]], and \"[[Northern Ireland]]\", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Dissatisfaction with this led to the [[Irish War of Independence]], which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]] (which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Ireland]]), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.\n\nFollowing the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future [[Northern Ireland]], if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the [[Irish Boundary Commission]]. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster's nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.\n\nElectorally, voting in the six [[Northern Ireland]] counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large [[Protestant]] minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party [[Fine Gael]] (\"Family of the Irish\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlass.com/intel/archives/006991.html |title=The Future's Bright For Donegal's Orangemen |accessdate=6 June 2008 |publisher=Independent News And Media |date=11 July 2004 }}</ref> However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a [[Church of Ireland]] member and [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as [[President of Ireland|President]] after having served as a long-term minister under [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and [[Jack Lynch]].\n\nThe [[Orange Order]] freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the [[Republic of Ireland]] takes place every July in the village of [[Rossnowlagh]], near [[Ballyshannon]], in the south of County Donegal.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn F\u00e9in (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.'s to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.'s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.'s to the D\u00e1il (one of whom is a Protestant).\n\nThe historic [[Flag of Ulster]] served as the basis for the [[Ulster Banner]] (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] until the proroguing of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament in 1973.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nWilliam Sherard (1659\u20131728) was the first biologist in Ulster.<ref>Deane, C.D. 1983.

In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]]. Hurling teams play in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], [[National Hurling League]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the [[Railway Cup]] in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]], [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]], [[Derry GAA|Derry]], and [[Down GAA|Down]].\n\nThe border has divided association football teams since 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=47|title=Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}</ref> The [[Irish Football Association]] (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place ([[Irish Football League]] in Northern Ireland, [[League of Ireland]] in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, [[Derry City F.C.]] has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is [[Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a 'North-West Derby'. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the [[Setanta Sports Cup]].\n\nIn [[Rugby union]], the professional rugby team representing the province and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] Ulster Branch, [[Ulster Rugby]], compete in the [[Pro14]] along with teams from [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces ([[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] and [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]]). They also compete in Europe's main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, [[Jack Kyle]] and [[Mike Gibson (rugby union)|Mike Gibson]]. The former is the most capped [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the Irish national team. They do not sing the Irish national anthem but do sing a special song which has been written celebrating the \"4 proud provinces\" before matches start.\n\nThe [[Ulster Hockey Union]] organises [[field hockey]] in the province and contributes substantially to the all-island hockey team.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/50209912 | title = Ireland hockey: Seven Ulster players in squad for Olympic qualifier against Canada | work = BBC Sport | date = 28 October 2019 | accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=cricket+belfast+protestant|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|first1=John|last1=McGarry|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|date=8 June 1995|publisher=Wiley|via=Google Books|isbn=9780631183495}}</ref> Ulster enters two teams into the [[Cricket in Ireland#Inter-Provincial Series|Interprovincial Series]]; the [[Northern Knights (cricket team)|North Knights]] and the [[North West Warriors]], who are the respective representative teams of the [[Northern Cricket Union]] (NCU) and the [[North West Cricket Union]] (NWCU).\n\nGolf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other. Ulster has produced many great players over the years, from [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] winning The Open Championship in 1947 at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake to most recently [[Rory McIlroy]] winning the US Open and [[Darren Clarke]] winning The Open Championship in 2011. Ulster also has another Major winner in [[Graeme McDowell]], who also won the US Open in 2010.  The Open Championship returned to Ulster, after 68 years, in 2019 at [[Royal Portrush Golf Club]].\n\nIn horse racing, specifically National Hunt, Ulster has produced the most dominant jockey of all time, [[Tony McCoy]].\n\nThe [[Circuit of Ireland Rally]] is an annual [[auto racing|automobile]] [[rallying|rally]] held in Ulster since 1931.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Northern Ireland|Ireland}}\n* [[Ulster nationalism]]\n* [[Kings of Ulster]]\n* [[List of Ulster-related topics]]\n* [[Ulster-Scots people]]\n* [[Plantations of Ireland]]\n* [[Culture of Ulster]]\n* [[Ulster GAA]]\n* [[Red Hand of Ulster]]\n* [[Ulidia (kingdom)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Deane, C.

Heinlein]], in which American secret agents battle parasitic invaders from outer space. It was originally serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' (September, October, November 1951).\n\nThe novel evokes a sense of [[paranoia]] and Heinlein repeatedly makes explicit the analogy between the [[Parasites in fiction|mind-controlling parasites]] and the Communist Russians, echoing the prevailing [[Second Red Scare]] in the United States.\n\nThe book takes up the then common theme of sightings of ''[[Flying saucer]]s'', the plot assuming that that the \"saucers\" seen in the 1950s were part of a preliminary [[reconnaissance]] of Earth, carried out by the extraterrestrials in preparation for a full-fledged invasion sixty years later. \n\n==Setting==\nThe novel's first scene is set in 2007. Following a nuclear war between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Western Bloc]], which left both sides battered but unbroken, both sides return to a state of [[Cold War]]. Washington D.C. and other American cities devastated in nuclear strikes had been completely rebuilt. The Soviet Union and China remain a single bloc dominated by Moscow, and the sharp [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the late 1950s never happened.\n\nSocial customs have changed somewhat, in a way typical for Heinlein's fiction (i.e. having become more liberal, such as [[Prenuptial agreement|marriage contracts]] being possible with fixed terms, etc.) and [[Raygun|ray guns]] and personal [[flying car]]s are commonplace. Space stations exist and [[Space colonization|colonies]] have been [[Colonization of Venus|established]] on the planet Venus (depicted, as common in SF of the time, as a tropical planet habitable by humans).\n\nSpace technology is far more advanced than in the actual first decade of the 21st century. For example, in the last scene, a space warship is sent on a twelve-year trip to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], with not only life-support for a large crew, but also enough armaments&nbsp;\u2014 presumably [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]]&nbsp;\u2014 to confront an entire world on its own.\n\nHowever, [[communications satellite]]s have not been thought of, and television broadcasts are still limited to line-of-sight, as they were at the time of writing. This is of critical importance to the plot. The territory of the United States is divided into numerous transmission blocks, which receive television broadcasts from their neighbors and relay them onwards. When the invaders seize one of these blocks, they effectively control all communications within it and can isolate its inhabitants from the outside world, deny the central government any access to them, and consolidate control at their leisure.\n\nThe current President - on his second term, and therefore presumably elected in 2000 - had established directly upon being first elected a new intelligece agency, known as The Section. Its  creation was never authorized by Congress and its existence is kept secret, being funded by sums diverted from innocuous sounding items in the Budget. It has a disguised underground headquarters in Washington D.C. and a network of similarly disguised branch offices around the US. Unlike the clearly demarked spheres of the FBI and CIA, the Section carries out extensive espionage in Soviet territory, but also conducts operations inside the United States. If ordered to, its agents are ready to shoot and kill American citizens on US soil. The Section's Director, who had been the President's campaign manager, is universally called \"The Old Man\". Only gradually does the reader learn that he is the protagonist's actual father.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Galaxy 195109.jpg|thumb|right|The opening installment of ''The Puppet Masters'' took the cover of the September 1951 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'']]\nIn the summer of 2007, Earth is under clandestine attack.  Slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, are attaching themselves to people's backs, taking control of their victims' nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  The Old Man, the head of a clandestine national [[security agency]] called the Section, goes to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], with Sam and Mary, two of his best agents, to investigate a flying saucer report, but much more seriously the ominous disappearance of the six agents sent previously. They discover that the slugs are steadily taking over Des Moines, but they cannot convince the [[President of the United States|US President]] to declare an emergency.\n\nSam takes two other agents and returns to Des Moines to get more evidence of the invasion.  They fail and are obliged to leave the city quickly, but in the confusion of their fleeing the city's television center a slug sneaks onto one of the agents.  Back in Washington the team discovers the slug and captures it, but later it escapes and attaches itself to Sam, using Sam's skills and knowledge to make a clean escape.\n\nThoroughly puppetized, Sam begins to infiltrate more slugs into the city, using the Constitution Club as a recruiting center.  The Old Man captures him, takes him to Section's new headquarters, and coerces Sam into being taken by the slug again. Under drug-induced hypnosis Sam reveals that the slugs come from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the sixth moon of [[Saturn]]. Being forced into a traumatic situation strains Sam's relationship with both Mary and the Old Man. Later, Sam finds that the President and [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] are ready to accept the idea that the United States has been infiltrated and they mandate a law that requires people to go naked to demonstrate that they are not carrying slugs.\n\nAs the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] prepares a counter-attack in the most heavily infested areas, Sam goes alone to [[Kansas City]] to get an estimate of the number of slugs involved.  There he learns that he can kill a slug by crushing it with his hand.  He also discovers that the slugs reproduce through fission.  Escaping from the city, he returns to Washington too late to stop the counter-attack, which fails.\n\nAfter a short leave, during which they get married and kill a slug that seems to have been targeting Sam for repossession, Sam and Mary return to work. Together with the Old Man, they go to [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]] to inspect a flying saucer that had made a bad landing.  Inside the alien ship Mary is overwhelmed by repressed memories from the time she was a child on Venus and had been possessed by a slug.  The slug had died from Nine-day Fever but Mary, luckily, had survived the disease.\n\nAdopting [[biological warfare]], the authorities culture Nine-day Fever and its cure in bulk sufficient to cover the country, and then infected slugs are allowed to escape into the heavily infested areas.  Several days later thousands of medics are landed in those areas to give the cure to those people whose slugs have died.  Sam and the Old Man join the effort in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], but the Old Man is possessed by the last healthy slug in the city and he knocks Sam out.\n\nSam regains consciousness in an air-car that the Old Man is flying to the [[Yucat\u00e1n]], where the slug intends to restart its effort to conquer Humanity.  With the car on autopilot, the Old Man slumps over the steering wheel and the slug begins to fission so that it can possess both the Old Man and Sam.  In desperation, Sam kicks the controls, causing the air-car to accelerate so sharply that the Old Man is slammed back against the seat forcefully enough to crush the slug.  The air-car's emergency system mitigates the resulting crash and Sam and the Old Man wait to be rescued.\n\nSome years later Sam and Mary board a spaceship headed for Saturn on a mission to exterminate the slugs.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Sam''', born Elihu Nivens, is the classic Heinlein hero, multi-talented, independent, fiercely loyal to friends and an implacable enemy to foes. He is thirtyish, but has changed appearance so many times even he has doubts as to how he originally looked.\n*'''Mary''', born ''Allucquere'' in a religious commune in Antarctica before growing up on Venus, is Heinlein's classic heroine.  She is beautiful, red-headed, hard-nosed and brilliant. Sam describes her as having the \"real redheaded saurian bony structure to her skull\". Her professional exterior conceals psychological scars from her encounter with the slugs as a child. Only the Old Man knows the truth about her, thanks to the deep hypnotic analysis that all agents have to undergo.\n*'''The Old Man''', born Andrew Nivens, is the head of a top secret government agency that he wishes did not have to exist, doing his job reluctantly because nobody else would do it properly. He represents the third of Heinlein's favorite types of character, the \"wise, grumpy old man\".  He is the first in the line that includes [[Jubal Harshaw]], [[The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress|Professor Bernardo de la Paz]], [[I Will Fear No Evil|Johann Sebastian Bach Smith]], [[Gulf (novella)#Characters|\"Kettle Belly\" Baldwin]], and the later life of [[Lazarus Long]]. (Lazarus Long's grandfather, who has a major role in the later part of ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', is particularly similar in character to \"The Old Man\".)\n\n==Alternative version==\nHeinlein's original version of the novel was 96,000 words, and was cut to about 60,000 words for both the 1951 book version and the serialization in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''. For the ''Galaxy'' version, editor [[H. L. Gold]] also did extensive rewriting, to which Heinlein strenuously objected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Il terrore dalla sesta luna|publisher=Mondadori|author=Giuseppe Lippi (introduction)|date=1990|isbn=8804341033}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, two years after Heinlein's death, an expanded version was published with the consent of his widow, [[Virginia Heinlein]]. This edition contained material that had been cut from the original published version, because the book was deemed to be too long and controversial for the market in 1951. The uncut version seemed more risqu\u00e9 in 1951 than it did decades later. For example, in the uncut version the book begins with Sam waking up in bed with a blonde whom he had casually picked up the evening before, without even bothering to learn her name; the older version  omitted all mention of her. The 1951 version does mention that men possessed by the invaders lost all sexual feeling&nbsp;\u2014 an essential element in the early parts of the plot; the original publisher completely cut out a reference to the \"puppet masters\" later discovering human sexuality and embarking upon wild orgies, broadcast live on television in the areas under their control.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] characterized ''The Puppet Masters'' as \"a thunderously exciting melodrama of intrigue\", noting that Heinlein displayed \"not only his usual virtues of clear logic, rigorous detail-work, and mastery of indirect exposition\", but also unexpected virtues like \"a startling facility in suspense devices [and] a powerful ingenuity in plotting\".<ref>\"Recommended Reading,\" ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', February 1952, p.105</ref> [[P. Schuyler Miller]], noting that the novel's \"climactic situations seem to be telegraphed\", suggested that Heinlein presented his background situations so effectively that readers solve the story's mysteries more quickly than Heinlein allowed his characters to.<ref>\"The Reference Library\", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1952, pp.159</ref> In his \"Books\" column for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', [[Damon Knight]] selected the novel as one of the 10 best [[science fiction|SF]] books of the 1950s.<ref>\"Books\", ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', April 1960, p.99</ref>\n\nThe book was also reviewed in the 1951 Jun 15 issue of Kirkus Reviews.  The reviewer wrote,\n<blockquote>The recurrent enigma of the flying saucer is finally solved when an aerial pieplate is caught with its exhaust down by the F.B.I. of 2007.  Hero Sam penetrates the contaminated area, brings a \u2018master' back&nbsp;\u2014 a gelatinous gray mass which attaches itself to a soldier's body and controls his thought processes.  Sam and his girl spot further landings, plan a counter campaign and eventually are able to rid the solar system of its parasites.  Exciting, even if it exacts a strong stomach.<ref>Found in the Kirkus Reviews archive at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-a-heinlein/puppet-masters/ Retrieved 2014 Oct 27</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Publication history==\nAn extensive list of the novel's publications can be found on the Internet Speculative Fiction DataBase at  http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1358 (Retrieved 2014 Oct 23)\n\n== Adaptations ==\n''[[The Brain Eaters]]'', a 1958 science fiction film directed by Bruno VeSota, bore a number of similarities to Heinlein's novel. Heinlein sued the film's producers, including Executive Producer [[Roger Corman]], for [[plagiarism]], asking $150,000 in damages. The case was settled out of court for $5,000,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A year of fear : a day-by-day guide to 366 horror films|last=1962-|first=Senn, Bryan|isbn=9781476610900|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=905696326|date = 2015-03-26}}</ref> which included Heinlein's stipulation that his name not be used on screen or in any way with the production. The case halted actor [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s intention of producing a film based on Heinlein's novel.\n\nThe theme of the novel is echoed in \"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\", an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' aired in 1964, and also in \"[[Operation: Annihilate!]]\", the last episode of the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' in 1967. Similarly, in the story line begun in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Coming of Age]]\" and completed in \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", aliens from a faraway sector invade the bodies of high-ranking Starfleet admirals in an attempt to compromise the command structure and spearhead an invasion of Earth.\n\nThe novel was adapted, with some plot and character changes, into the 1994 [[The Puppet Masters (film)|film of the same name]]. The film followed the story rather closely, except for the setting changed to modern-day, thus losing most of the advanced technology, but it was not successful with either the critics or the public.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[John Clute|Clute, John]], and David Pringle. \"Heinlein, Robert A.\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.

(Lazarus Long's grandfather, who has a major role in the later part of ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', is particularly similar in character to \"The Old Man\".)\n\n==Alternative version==\nHeinlein's original version of the novel was 96,000 words, and was cut to about 60,000 words for both the 1951 book version and the serialization in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''. For the ''Galaxy'' version, editor [[H. L. Gold]] also did extensive rewriting, to which Heinlein strenuously objected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Il terrore dalla sesta luna|publisher=Mondadori|author=Giuseppe Lippi (introduction)|date=1990|isbn=8804341033}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, two years after Heinlein's death, an expanded version was published with the consent of his widow, [[Virginia Heinlein]]. This edition contained material that had been cut from the original published version, because the book was deemed to be too long and controversial for the market in 1951. The uncut version seemed more risqu\u00e9 in 1951 than it did decades later. For example, in the uncut version the book begins with Sam waking up in bed with a blonde whom he had casually picked up the evening before, without even bothering to learn her name; the older version  omitted all mention of her. The 1951 version does mention that men possessed by the invaders lost all sexual feeling&nbsp;\u2014 an essential element in the early parts of the plot; the original publisher completely cut out a reference to the \"puppet masters\" later discovering human sexuality and embarking upon wild orgies, broadcast live on television in the areas under their control.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] characterized ''The Puppet Masters'' as \"a thunderously exciting melodrama of intrigue\", noting that Heinlein displayed \"not only his usual virtues of clear logic, rigorous detail-work, and mastery of indirect exposition\", but also unexpected virtues like \"a startling facility in suspense devices [and] a powerful ingenuity in plotting\".<ref>\"Recommended Reading,\" ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', February 1952, p.105</ref> [[P. Schuyler Miller]], noting that the novel's \"climactic situations seem to be telegraphed\", suggested that Heinlein presented his background situations so effectively that readers solve the story's mysteries more quickly than Heinlein allowed his characters to.<ref>\"The Reference Library\", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1952, pp.159</ref> In his \"Books\" column for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', [[Damon Knight]] selected the novel as one of the 10 best [[science fiction|SF]] books of the 1950s.<ref>\"Books\", ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', April 1960, p.99</ref>\n\nThe book was also reviewed in the 1951 Jun 15 issue of Kirkus Reviews.  The reviewer wrote,\n<blockquote>The recurrent enigma of the flying saucer is finally solved when an aerial pieplate is caught with its exhaust down by the F.B.I. of 2007.  Hero Sam penetrates the contaminated area, brings a \u2018master' back&nbsp;\u2014 a gelatinous gray mass which attaches itself to a soldier's body and controls his thought processes.  Sam and his girl spot further landings, plan a counter campaign and eventually are able to rid the solar system of its parasites.  Exciting, even if it exacts a strong stomach.<ref>Found in the Kirkus Reviews archive at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-a-heinlein/puppet-masters/ Retrieved 2014 Oct 27</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Publication history==\nAn extensive list of the novel's publications can be found on the Internet Speculative Fiction DataBase at  http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1358 (Retrieved 2014 Oct 23)\n\n== Adaptations ==\n''[[The Brain Eaters]]'', a 1958 science fiction film directed by Bruno VeSota, bore a number of similarities to Heinlein's novel. Heinlein sued the film's producers, including Executive Producer [[Roger Corman]], for [[plagiarism]], asking $150,000 in damages. The case was settled out of court for $5,000,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A year of fear : a day-by-day guide to 366 horror films|last=1962-|first=Senn, Bryan|isbn=9781476610900|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=905696326|date = 2015-03-26}}</ref> which included Heinlein's stipulation that his name not be used on screen or in any way with the production. The case halted actor [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s intention of producing a film based on Heinlein's novel.\n\nThe theme of the novel is echoed in \"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\", an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' aired in 1964, and also in \"[[Operation: Annihilate!]]\", the last episode of the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' in 1967. Similarly, in the story line begun in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Coming of Age]]\" and completed in \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", aliens from a faraway sector invade the bodies of high-ranking Starfleet admirals in an attempt to compromise the command structure and spearhead an invasion of Earth.\n\nThe novel was adapted, with some plot and character changes, into the 1994 [[The Puppet Masters (film)|film of the same name]]. The film followed the story rather closely, except for the setting changed to modern-day, thus losing most of the advanced technology, but it was not successful with either the critics or the public.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[John Clute|Clute, John]], and David Pringle. \"Heinlein, Robert A.\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.

The 28th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the first film in [[The Little Mermaid (franchise)|''The Little Mermaid'' franchise]], it is loosely based on the Danish [[fairy tale]] [[The Little Mermaid|of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The film tells the story of a [[mermaid]] Princess named [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Eric]]. Written and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], with music by [[Alan Menken]] and [[Howard Ashman]] (who also served as co-producer alongside John Musker), and art direction by [[Michael Peraza|Michael Peraza Jr.]] and Donald A. Towns, the film features the voices of [[Jodi Benson]], [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], [[Samuel E. Wright]], Jason Marin, [[Kenneth Mars]], [[Buddy Hackett]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]].\n\n''The Little Mermaid'' was released to theaters on November 17, 1989 to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and plot. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Little Mermaid (1989) \u2013 Box Office Summary|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=littlemermaid.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> and {{US$|233 million|long=no}} in total lifetime gross worldwide.<ref name=\"DisneyWW\"/> After the success of the 1986 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated film ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''<ref>https://www.mouseplanet.com/9534/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_One</ref><ref>https://www.mouseplanet.com/9549/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_Two</ref> and the 1988 Disney/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]] live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', ''The Little Mermaid'' is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after a string of critical or commercial failures produced by Disney that dated back to the early 1970s.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by [[Kay Nielsen]] for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story was coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\">(2006) ''Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's 'The Little Mermaid'' [Documentary featurette].

However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make ''The Little Mermaid'' a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]], both noted for their work as the writers of the successful [[Off-Broadway]] stage musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', teamed up to compose the entire song score.

The artistic manpower needed for ''The Little Mermaid'' required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> An attempt to use Disney's famed [[multiplane camera]] for the first time in years for quality \"depth\" shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition.

Disney's next film, ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by [[Pixar]] called CAPS/ink & paint ([[Computer Animation Production System]]), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in ''The Little Mermaid''.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state.

The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in [[Burbank, California]], Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]], France.<ref name=\"WDFAtimeline\">{{Citation|title=After the Magic; Scores of Former Disney Animators and Their Colleagues Have Dispersed to Launch Their Own Studios, Seek New Careers and Discover New Identities \u2013 Determined to Land on Their Feet|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/653286501.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+20%2C+2004&author=Roger+Moore%2C+Sentinel+Movie+Critic&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&edition=&startpage=F.1&desc=AFTER+THE+MAGIC+%3B+SCORES+OF+FORMER+DISNEY+ANIMATORS+AND+THEIR+COLLEAGUES+HAVE+DISPERSED+TO+LAUNCH+THEIR+OWN+STUDIOS%2C+SEEK+NEW+CAREERS+AND+DISCOVER+NEW+IDENTITIES+--+DETERMINED+TO+LAND+ON+THEIR+FEET.|first=Roger|last=Moore|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|pages=F1|date=June 20, 2004|access-date=May 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, ''The Little Mermaid'' signaled the re-establishment of the musical film format as a standard for Disney animated films.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

Katzenberg passed the project over, because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live-action mermaid comedy ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984) and felt ''The Little Mermaid'' would be too similar a project.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> The next day, however, Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development, along with ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by [[Kay Nielsen]] for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story was coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\">(2006) ''Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's 'The Little Mermaid'' [Documentary featurette].

However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene.

Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg.
