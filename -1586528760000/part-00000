Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco's popularity in the United States, including \u201cthe [[Bump (dance)|Bump]]\u201d and \u201cthe [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]\u201d.\n\nBy the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs such as [[Studio 54]] in New York City, a venue popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive, extravagant and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]] in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[Quaaludes]], the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]] as a reflection of the [[sexual revolution]] of this era in popular history.\n\nDisco was the last popular music movement driven by the [[baby boom generation]]. It began to decline in the United States during 1979\u201380, and by 1982 it had lost nearly all popularity there. [[Disco Demolition Night]], an anti-disco protest held in [[Chicago]] on July 12, 1979, remains the most well-known of several incidents across the country that symbolized disco's declining fortune.\n\nDisco was a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]] in general and [[house music]] in particular. It has had several revivals, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s highly successful 2005 album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', and more recently in the 2010s, entering the pop charts in the US and the UK.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"disco\" is shorthand for the word ''discoth\u00e8que'', a French word for \"library of phonograph records\" derived from \"biblioth\u00e8que\". The word \"discoth\u00e8que\" had the same meaning in English in the 1950s.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|title=The birth of disco|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|date=October 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416163030/http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|archive-date=April 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n\"Discoth\u00e8que\" became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris after these had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960 it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.<ref name=Oxford />\n\nIn the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called \"discotheque dress\" was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form \"disco\" described this dress and has been found in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' of 12 July 1964, but ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.<ref name=Oxford />\n\nVince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre.

[[Lead guitar]] features less frequently in disco than in [[Rock music|rock]]. \"The 'chicken scratch' sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Beginners/en-us/What-the-Funk-!-How-to-Get-That-James-Brown-Sound.aspx|title=What the Funk?!

Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.\n\nThe [[rhythm section|rhythm]] is laid down by prominent, syncopated [[bassline]]s (with heavy use of broken [[octave]]s, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]. The sound was enriched with solo lines and [[harmony part]]s played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]], string section or a full [[string orchestra]].\n\nMost disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the [[rhythm guitar]] and may be implied rather than explicitly present.\n\nSongs often use [[syncopation]], which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the [[bass drum]] hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.\n\nThe orchestral sound is usually known as \"disco sound\" relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background \"pad\" sound defining the [[chord progression|harmony progression]]. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich \"[[wall of sound]]\". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by [[Chic (band)|Chic]].\n\nHarmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords, which are found more often in jazz than pop music.\n\n==Production==\nThe \"disco sound\" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of [[funk]], [[soul music]] of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of \"[[classical music|classical]]\" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).\n\nDisco songs were [[Arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[Orchestration|orchestrators]], and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using [[multitrack recording]] techniques and [[effects unit]]s. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, record producers, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and [[Break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the \"disco sound\" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated [[disco mix]].\n\nEarly records were the \"standard\" three-minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl [[single (music)|singles]] of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five&nbsp;minutes of good-quality music. With the help of Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10\" disc instead of 7\". They cut the next single on a 12\" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. [[Twelve-inch single|12\" single records]], also known as \"[[Maxi single]]s\", quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|title=DISCO History @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121160210/http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|archive-date=January 21, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Disco club culture==\n===U.S. disco nightclubs===\n{{See also|Circuit parties}}\n[[File:Blue disco quad roller skates.jpg|thumb|Blue disco quad [[roller skates]].]]\n\nBy the late 1970s most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were in [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and most notably [[New York City]]. The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and private [[loft]] parties.\n\nIn the 1970s, notable discos included \"[[Crisco Disco]]\", \"The Sanctuary\", \"Leviticus\", \"[[Studio 54]]\" and \"[[Paradise Garage]]\" in New York, \"Artemis\" in Philadelphia, \"Studio One\" in Los Angeles, \"Dugan's Bistro\" in Chicago, and \"The Library\" in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|title=Once a Hot Disco, Now a Cool Opportunity \u2013 Philadelphia Magazine|date=May 18, 2016|website=Phillymag.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028004100/http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|archive-date=October 28, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Disco197510/>\n\nIn the late 70s, \"[[Studio 54]]\" in [[New York City]] was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general. It was operated by [[Steve Rubell]] and [[Ian Schrager]] and was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the \"[[Man in the Moon]]\" that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].\n\nThe \"[[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]\", another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a [[Barry Manilow]] [[Copacabana (At the Copa)|song of the same name]].\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], large disco clubs such as \"The Pier\" (\"Pier 9\") and \"The Other Side,\" originally regarded exclusively as \"[[Gay bar|gay bars,\"]] became particularly popular among the capital area's gay and straight college students in the late 70s.\n\n===Sound and light equipment===\n[[File:Dance floor 2 by harmon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Major disco clubs had lighted dance floors, with the lights flashing to complement the beat.]]\n[[File:ZMF 2015 IMGP 0000.jpg|thumb|The reflective light [[disco ball]] was a fixture on the ceilings of many discoth\u00e8ques.]]\nPowerful, bass-heavy, [[hi-fi]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. \"Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of [[subwoofer]]s positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade [[sound engineer]]s such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.\"<ref name=\"timlawrence.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.timlawrence.info/articles2/2013/7/16/beyond-the-hustle-seventies-social-dancing-discotheque-culture-and-the-emergence-of-the-contemporary-club-dancer|title=\"Beyond the Hustle: Seventies Social Dancing, Discotheque Culture and the Emergence of the Contemporary Club Dancer\".

DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a [[DJ mixer]] and using a [[microphone]] to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as [[reverb]], equalization, and echo [[effects unit]]. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include [[Francis Grasso]] of The Sanctuary, [[David Mancuso]] of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], [[Frankie Knuckles]] of the Chicago [[Warehouse (nightclub)|Warehouse]], [[Larry Levan]] of the [[Paradise Garage]], [[Nicky Siano]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[Karen Mixon Cook]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]], Richie Kulala of [[Studio 54]] and Rick Salsalini.\n\nSome DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the [[recording studio]]. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific record producer as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in leading nightclubs, DJs were also influential for the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.\n\n===Disco dancing===\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura162.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Disco dancers typically wore loose slacks for men and flowing dresses for women, which enabled ease of movement on the dance floor.]]\nIn the early years, dancers in discos danced in a \"hang loose\" or \"freestyle\" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the \"Bump\", \"Penguin\", \"Boogaloo\", \"Watergate\" and \"Robot\". By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|the Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].<ref name=\"Disco197510\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&pg=840,3518488&dq=disco+music&hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975</ref>\n\nDuring the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ''\"touch dancing\"'', ''\"the hustle\"'', and ''\"[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]]\"''. The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book ''The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing'' (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book topped the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.\n\nIn Chicago, the ''Step By Step'' disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that [[Don Cornelius]] used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''Step by Step'''s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show which aired on Saturday mornings had a following of dancers who would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as \"Disco Night at White Sox Park\".\n\nSome notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn [[Reality TV|dance competition TV shows]] such as ''[[Dance Fever]]'' (1979).\n\n===Disco fashion===\nDisco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore glamorous, expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as [[Halston]] dresses or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless [[halter top]]s, [[disco pants]], \"hot pants\" or body-hugging [[spandex]] bodywear or \"catsuits\".<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|title=Disco Fashion: That's the way They Liked It|website=The Ultimate History Project|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006032157/http://ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Men would wear shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore [[Pierre Cardin]] suits, [[three piece suit]]s with a vest and [[Double knitting|double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the [[leisure suit]]. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted in some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom, but the lower part of the pants were flared in a [[bell bottom]] style, to permit freedom of movement.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/>\n\nDuring the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, both activities that would have been considered \"feminine\" according to the gender stereotypes of the era.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/> Women dancers wore [[glitter]] makeup, [[sequin]]s or [[gold lam\u00e9]] clothing that would shimmer under the lights.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/> Bold colors were popular for both genders.

New York/London: Routledge 2017, pp. 121-127.</ref> As opposed to [[rock music]] which has a very [[Phallocentrism|phallic centered]] eroticism focusing on the sexual pleasure of men over other persons, Dyer describes disco as featuring a non-phallic full body eroticism.<ref name=\"Dyer\"/> Through a range of percussion instruments, a willingness to play with rhythm, and the endless repeating of phrases without cutting the listener off, disco achieved this full body eroticism by restoring eroticism to the whole body for both sexes.<ref name=\"Dyer\"/> This allowed for the potential expression of sexualities not defined by the cock/penis, and the erotic pleasure of bodies that are not defined by a relationship to a penis.<ref name=\"Dyer\"/> The sexual liberation expressed through the rhythm of disco is further represented in the club spaces that disco grew within.\n\nIn [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]]\u2019s ''[[Modulations: A History of Electronic Music]]: Throbbing Words on Sound'', he discusses  eroticism through the technology disco utilizes to create it\u2019s audacious sound.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Modulations : a history of electronic music : throbbing words on sound |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |isbn=1-891024-06-X |pages=40\u201349 |url=https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap}}</ref> The music, Shapiro states, is adjunct to \u201cthe pleasure-is-politics ethos of post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] culture.\u201d He explains how \u201cmechano-eroticism,\u201d which links the technology used to create the unique mechanical sound of disco to eroticism, sets the genre in a new dimension of reality living outside of naturalism and heterosexuality.

In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, [[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as \u201cpoured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality.\u201d<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\">Bill Brewster/Frank Broughton: ''Last Night a DJ Saved my Life: The History of the Disc Jockey.'' London: Headline 1999, pp. 136-148.</ref> The Sanctuary was the \u201cfirst totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America\u201d and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, the bathrooms and the hallwasy of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy like sexual engagements.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> By describing the music, drugs and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. This supports the argument that the disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. Further, this coupled with the recent legalization of abortions, the introduction of antibiotics and the pill all facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment fostering a very sex positive framework around discotheques.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> Given that at this time all instances of oral and anal gay sex were considered deviant and illegal acts in New York state, this sexual freedom can be considered quite liberatory and resistant to dominant oppressive structures.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> Further, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] classified homosexuality as an illness.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. Davis Mancuso's club/house party, [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], was described as having a \"[[pansexual]] attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually cariried bail money with them.\"<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===First discotheques===\nDisco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band.

The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of race riots, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy and the [[Watergate]] scandal left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless.  The start of the \u201970s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Turn the Beat Around: the Secret History of Disco |url=https://archive.org/details/turnbeataround00pete |date=2005 |publisher=Faber |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture'', [[Simon Frith]] highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. \"The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie\", he says. \"The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.\"<ref>Alan McKee, ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture''. John Wiley & Sons, April 15, 2008, p.196</ref>\n\nWhen Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the [[gay community]] (which made up much of The Loft's attendee roster) was often harassed in the [[gay bar|gay bars and dance clubs]], with many gay men carrying bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private [[discotheque]]s, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, policies. [[Vince Aletti]] described it \"like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else,\" and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying \"It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life|last=Brewster|first=Bill|last2=Broughton|first2=Frank|publisher=Headline Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=120\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the popular embrace of disco's exuberant dance moves an escape from \"the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachrock.org/lesson/the-rise-of-disco/|title=The Rise of Disco|publisher=teachrock.org|accessdate=June 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618001058/http://teachrock.org/lesson/the-rise-of-disco|archive-date=June 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Pauline Kael]], writing about the disco-themed film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', said the film and disco itself touched on \"something deeply romantic, the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you'd like to be.

Those genres, mainly African-American ones, would influence much of early disco music.\n\nDuring the 60s, the Motown record label developed a popular and influential [[Motown sound|own sound]], described as having \"1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were half way between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-motown-story-19710513|title=The Motown Story|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> Motown had many hits with early disco elements by acts like [[the Supremes]] (for instance \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" in 1966), [[Stevie Wonder]] (for instance \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" in 1972), [[The Jackson 5]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]] (\"[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']]\" in 1973).\n\nIn the mid-1960s and early 1970s [[Philadelphia soul]] and [[New York soul]] developed as sub-genres that also had lavish [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], lush [[string orchestra]] arrangements and expensive record production processes.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s musicians and audiences from the Black, Italian and Latino communities adopted several traits from the [[hippie]] and [[psychedelia]] subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, and the use of [[hallucinogenic]] drugs.<ref name=\"Partylikeits1975\">[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It's 1975] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130151059/http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 |date=January 30, 2015 }}.

In the early 1970s, [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Isaac Hayes]] scored hits with cinematic soul songs that were actually composed for movie soundtracks: \"[[Superfly (song)|Superfly]]\" (1972) and \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" (1971).

These elements would become typical for disco music and are found in several of the hits they produced in the early 1970s:\n*\"[[Love Train]]\" by [[the O'Jays]] (with M.F.S.B. as the backup band) was released in 1972 and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in March 1973\n*\"[[The Love I Lost]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]] (1973)\n*\"[[Now That We Found Love]]\" by [[The O'Jays]] (1973), later a hit for [[Third World (band)|Third World]] in 1978.\n*\"[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]\" by [[MFSB]] with vocals by [[The Three Degrees]], a wordless song written as the theme for ''[[Soul Train]]'' and a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974.\n\nOther early disco tracks that helped shape disco and became popular on the dance floors of (underground) discotheque clubs and parties include: \n* \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" by [[Manu Dibango]] was first released in France in 1972. It was picked up by the underground disco scene in New York and subsequently got a proper release in the U.S., reaching #35 on Billboard Hot 100 in 1973.\n* \"[[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|The Night]]\" by [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] was released in 1972, but was not immediately popular. It appealed to the [[Northern soul]] scene and became a hit in the UK in 1975.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n* \"[[Love's Theme]]\" by [[Barry White]]'s [[the Love Unlimited Orchestra]], an instrumental song from their album ''[[Rhapsody in White]]'' reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 early in 1974.\n* \"[[Jungle Fever (song)|Jungle Fever]]\" by [[The Chakachas]] was first released in Belgium in 1971, was later released in the U.S. in 1972, where it reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year.\n* \"[[Girl You Need a Change of Mind]]\" by [[Eddie Kendricks]] was released in May 1972, on the album [[People ... Hold On]].\n\nEarly disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as [[Salsoul Records]] (Ken, Stanley, and [[Joseph Cayre]]), [[West End Records]] ([[Mel Cheren]]), [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] (Neil Bogart), and [[Prelude Records (record label)|Prelude]] (Marvin Schlachter), to name a few. The genre was also shaped by [[Tom Moulton]], who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs \u2014 thus creating the extended mix or \"[[remix]]\", going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12\" record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the \"disco sound\" included David Mancuso, [[Nicky Siano]], [[Shep Pettibone]], [[Larry Levan]], [[Walter Gibbons]], and Chicago-based [[Frankie Knuckles]]. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.\n\nDisco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show ''Soul Train'' in 1971 hosted by [[Don Cornelius]], then [[Marty Angelo]]'s ''[[Disco Step-by-Step Television Show]]'' in 1975, Steve Marcus' ''Disco Magic/Disco 77'', Eddie Rivera's ''Soap Factory'', and [[Merv Griffin]]'s ''[[Dance Fever]]'', hosted by [[Deney Terrio]], who is credited with teaching actor [[John Travolta]] to dance for his role in the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', as well as DANCE, based out of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].\n\nIn 1974, New York City's [[WPIX-FM]] premiered the first disco radio show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discosavvy.com/discoearly70s.html|title=The First Years of Disco (1972-1974)|website=discosavvy.com|access-date=2019-06-18|quote=In November 1974, WPIX FM launched the world's first disco radio show, \"Disco 102\", hosted by Steve Andrews for 4 hours every Saturday night.}}</ref>\n\n==== Norman Whitfield ====\nAs a producer and songwriter [[Norman Whitfield]] had helped to develop the Motown sound in the 1960s with many hits for [[Marvin Gaye]], [[the Velvelettes]], the Temptations and [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]]. From around the production of the Temptations' album ''[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations album)|Cloud Nine]]'' in 1968 he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. A clear example of such a long psychedelic soul track is \"[[Papa Was a Rollin' Stone]]\", which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12\" version. By the early 70s, many of his productions had evolved more and more towards funk and disco, as heard on albums by [[the Undisputed Truth]] and the 1973 album ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]'' by [[The Jackson 5]]. After he left Motown in 1975 he produced some more disco hits, including \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\" (1976) by [[Rose Royce]].\n\n==== Disco culture in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1970s ====\nIn the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] scene and formed the [[northern soul]] movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent) and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as [[Little Anthony & the Imperials]] and [[Jackie Wilson]].\n\nIn 1974 there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events.

Classical music was even adapted for disco, notably [[Walter Murphy]]'s \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" (1976, based on the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]]) and \"Flight 76\" (1976, based on [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s \"[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]\"), and [[Louis Clark]]'s ''[[Hooked On Classics]]'' series of albums and singles.\n\n[[File:Manhattan Transfer.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[a cappella]] [[jazz]] group [[the Manhattan Transfer]] had a disco hit with the 1979 \"Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone\" theme.]]\n\nMany original [[television]] [[theme songs]] of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', \"[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]\" (1977) by [[Meco]], and \"Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone\" (1979) by [[the Manhattan Transfer]]. Other examples include ''[[S.W.A.T.

[[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded \"[[Disco Duck]]\" (1976) and \"Dis-Gorilla\" (1977); [[Frank Zappa]] parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in \"[[Disco Boy]]\" on his 1976 ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' album, and in \"[[Dancin' Fool]]\" on his 1979 ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' album; [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|eponymous 1983 debut album]] includes a disco song called \"Gotta Boogie\", an extended pun on the similarity of the disco move to the American slang word \"[[Dried nasal mucus|booger]]\". Comedian [[Bill Cosby]] devoted his entire 1977 album ''[[Disco Bill]]'' to disco parodies. In 1980, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad Magazine]]'' released a flexi-disc titled ''Mad Disco'' featuring six full-length parodies of the genre. [[Rock and roll]] songs critical of disco included [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\" and, especially, [[The Who]]'s \"[[Sister Disco]]\" (both 1978)\u2014although The Who's \"[[Eminence Front]]\" (four years later) had a disco feel.\n\n===1979\u20131980s: The decline of disco===\n====Disco Demolition Night====\n[[File:Rich Carey, 1977.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Man wearing a ''Disco Sucks'' T-shirt.]]\nBy the end of the 1970s, a strong anti-disco sentiment developed among [[rock music]] fans and musicians, particularly in the United States.<ref name=allmusicdisco/><ref>''Encyclopedia of Contemporary American Culture'', {{ISBN|978-0-415-16161-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-16161-9}} (2001) p. 217: \"In fact, by 1977, before [[punk rock]] spread, there was a 'disco sucks' movement sponsored by radio stations that attracted some suburban white youth, who thought that disco was escapist, synthetic, and overproduced.\"</ref> Disco was criticized as mindless, [[Consumerism|consumerist]], [[Overproduction (music)|overproduced]] and [[escapism|escapist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/27/paranoia-at-the-disco|title=Disco Doesn't Suck.

Starting in the 1980s, [[country music]] began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. The continued popularity of [[power pop]] and the revival of [[oldies]] in the late 1970s was also related to disco's decline; the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was [[John Travolta]], who in 1977 had starred in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.\n\nDuring this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] purchased [[ABC Records]], absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. [[Midsong International Records]] ceased operations in 1980. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981 and [[TK Records]] closed in the same year. [[Salsoul Records]] continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|title=Salsoul Records @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014151424/http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Casablanca Records]] had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nMany groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success\u2014even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. [[The Bee Gees]], for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989's \"[[One (Bee Gees song)|One]]\") and three more top-40 songs (despite recording and releasing far more than that and completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs) in the United States after the 1970s, even though numerous songs they wrote and had ''other'' artists perform were successful. Of the handful of groups ''not'' taken down by disco's fall from favor, [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Donna Summer]], [[the Jacksons]]\u2014and [[Michael Jackson]] in particular\u2014stand out: In spite of having helped ''define'' the disco sound early on,<ref>''[[Jackson 5: The Ultimate Collection]]'' (1996), liner notes.</ref> they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s.\n\nSix months prior to the chaotic event (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI ([[WLS-FM]]) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that also competed against WDAI at the time, [[WGCI-FM]], would later incorporate [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the [[Chicago house]] genre to the airwaves.\n\n====Factors contributing to disco's decline====\nFactors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] from the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles led by participants.<ref name=\"BeeGees\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3652|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic BeeGees bio]</ref> In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the \"Disco sucks\" movement as implicitly [[machism|macho]] and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.<ref name=allmusicdisco/><ref name=espn/><ref name=Campion/> It was also interpreted being part of a wider cultural \"backlash\" towards conservatism,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jun/18/disco-sucks Ben Myers: \"Why 'Disco sucks!' sucked\"], in: [[The Guardian]], June 18, 2009, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref> that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the [[United States Senate]] for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the [[Religious Right]] around the same time.\n\nIn January 1979, rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] argued that [[homophobia]], and most likely [[racism]], were reasons behind the movement,<ref name=Christgau/> a conclusion seconded by [[John Rockwell]]. Craig Werner wrote: \"The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of [[funk]]ateers and [[feminist]]s, progressives and [[puritan]]s, rockers and reactionaries.

Record producer Giorgio Moroder's soundtracks to ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'' and ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (which also had a heavy disco influence) proved that the style was still very much embraced. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1982 album, ''[[Hot Space]]'' was inspired by the genre as well.\n\nTo a significant extent, the transition from disco to 80s dance music was one of relabeling. The ''word'' \"disco\" simply became unfashionable to use when describing new music. As late as 1983, [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]] had a major hit single, \"[[Give It Up (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Give It Up]]\", which was not considered disco, even though it would have been considered to be in the heart of the genre if it had been released four years earlier.\n\nIn 1980's [[house music]], and [[Chicago house]] in particular, a strong disco influence\u2014mediated by subgenres like [[post disco]] and [[Italo disco]]\u2014was constantly present, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping [[electronic dance music]] and contemporary club culture, is often described being \"disco's revenge\".<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg85ab/house-music-is-discos-revenge-a-look-at-the-early-days-of-american-house \"House Music is Disco\u2019s Revenge: A Look at the Early Days of American House\"], in: [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] magazine, September 9, 2014, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, disco and its legacy also became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs and films were released that referenced disco. Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included [[Deee-Lite]]'s \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\" (1990), [[U2]]'s \"[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]\" (1993), [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]\" (1994) & \"Entertain Me\" (1995), [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s \"[[Disco 2000 (song)|Disco 2000]]\" (1995), and [[Jamiroquai]]'s \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" (1999), while films such as ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.\n\n===2000\u2013present: Success of nu-disco and disco revival===\n{{main|Nu-disco}}\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura159.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Students from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]] dancing to disco during a cultural event on campus]]\nIn the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called \"nu-disco\" began breaking into the mainstream.

[[Robbie Williams]]' disco single \"[[Rock DJ]]\" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] released a disco song, \"Miss Europa Disco Dancer\", in 2001.

In addition to that, her song \"[[Hung Up]]\" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled [[ABBA]]'s 1979 song \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her [[Confessions Tour]] also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the [[roller derby]].\n\nThe success of the \"nu-disco\" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: \"The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It\u2019s a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. [[Madison Avenue (band)|Madison Avenue]] look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid.

The show's success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to stage, and to record charts, Discoth\u00e8que Divas like Lady Zu and As Fren\u00e9ticas.\n\nOther top-10 entries from 2015 like [[Mark Ronson]]'s disco groove-infused \"[[Uptown Funk]]\", [[Maroon 5]]'s \"[[Sugar (Maroon 5 song)|Sugar]]\", [[the Weeknd]]'s \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\" and [[Jason Derulo]]'s \"[[Want to Want Me|Want To Want Me]]\" also ascended the charts and have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared with his new album ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Giorgio Moroder album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' in 2015 which has proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like \"[[I Don't Like It, I Love It]]\" by [[Flo Rida]], \"[[Adventure of a Lifetime]]\" by [[Coldplay]], \"[[Back Together (Robin Thicke song)|Back Together]]\" by [[Robin Thicke]] and \"[[Levels (Nick Jonas song)|Levels]]\" by [[Nick Jonas]] feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs are showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that have been dominating the current charts. Justin Timberlake's 2016 song \"[[Can't Stop the Feeling!]]\", which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the history of the chart.

Her 1980 dance classics \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" and \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\" were written and produced by [[Nile Rogers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of the group [[Chic]]. [[The Supremes]], the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976's \"[[I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking]]\" and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's \"You're My Driving Wheel\".\n\nAt the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, [[Marvin Gaye]] released \"[[Got to Give It Up]]\" in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre, and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye's songs have disco elements, including [[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]] (1975). [[Stevie Wonder]] released the disco single \"[[Sir Duke]]\" in 1977 as a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], the influential [[jazz]] legend who had died in 1974. [[Smokey Robinson]] left the Motown group [[the Miracles]] for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album ''[[A Quiet Storm]]'' in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the \"Quiet Storm\" musical programming format and subgenre of R&B. It contained the disco single \"[[Baby That's Backatcha]]\". Other Motown artists who scored disco hits include: Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with [[Love Machine (The Miracles song)|\"Love Machine\"]] (1975), [[Eddie Kendricks]] with [[Keep on Truckin' (song)|\"Keep On Truckin'\"]] (1973), [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]] with \"[[Down to Love Town]]\" (1976) and [[Thelma Houston]] with her cover of the [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] song \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\" (1976). The label continued to release successful disco songs into the 1980s with [[Rick James]]' \"[[Super Freak]]\" (1981), and the [[Commodores]]' \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\" (1981).\n\nSeveral of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. [[Mary Wells]], Motown's first female superstar with her signature song \"[[My Guy]]\" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song [[Gigolo (Mary Wells song)|\"Gigolo\"]] in 1980. [[Jimmy Ruffin]], the elder brother of [[the Temptations]] lead singer [[David Ruffin]], was also signed to Motown, and released his most successful and well-known song \"[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]\" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song \"[[Hold On (To My Love)]]\", which was written and produced by [[Robin Gibb]] of the Bee Gees, for his album ''[[Sunrise (Jimmy Ruffin album)|Sunrise]]''. [[Edwin Starr]], known for his Motown protest song \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, \"[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|Contact]]\" and \"[[H.A.P.P.Y. Radio (song)|H.A.P.P.Y. Radio]]\".\n\n[[Kiki Dee]] became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, ''Great Expectations'' (1970), and two singles \"The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday\" (1970) and \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" (1971), the latter giving her first ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with [[Elton John]]'s [[The Rocket Record Company]], and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with [[Tammi Terrell]] and [[Kim Weston]]. Michael Jackson released many successful solo singles under the Motown label, like [[Got to Be There (song)|\"Got To Be There\"]] (1971), [[Ben (song)|\"Ben\"]] (1972) and a cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s [[Rockin' Robin (song)|\"Rockin' Robin\"]] (1972). He went on to score hits in the disco genre with \"[[Rock with You]]\" (1979), \"[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]\" (1979) and \"[[Billie Jean]]\" (1983) for [[Epic Records]].\n\nMany Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. Michael Jackson was the lead singer of [[the Jackson 5]], one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s. They left the record company in 1975 ([[Jermaine Jackson]], however, remained with the label) after successful songs like \"[[I Want You Back]]\" (1969) and \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" (1970), and even the disco song \"[[Dancing Machine]]\" (1974). Renamed as 'the Jacksons' (as Motown owned the name 'the Jackson 5'), they went on to find success with disco songs like \"Blame It on the Boogie\" (1978), \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" (1979) and \"Can You Feel It?\" (1981) on the Epic label. [[the Isley Brothers]], whose short tenure at the company had produced the song \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like [[That Lady (song)|\"That Lady\"]] (1973) and \"[[It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)]]\" (1979). [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]], who recorded the most successful version of \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as \"Baby, Don't Change Your Mind\" (1977) and \"Bourgie, Bourgie\" (1980) in the disco era.\n\n[[The Detroit Spinners]] were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song \"[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]\" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow [[Detroit]] native [[Aretha Franklin]], to [[Atlantic Records]], and there had disco songs like \"[[The Rubberband Man]]\" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's \"[[Are You Ready for Love]]\", as well as a medley of [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]' song \"[[Working My Way Back to You]]\" and Michael Zager's \"Forgive Me, Girl\". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, ''[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]'' (1972) \u2013 to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, [[The Night (Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song)|\"The Night\"]], was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the [[Northern Soul]] circuit, reached number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song \"[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]\" (1975) for [[Warner Curb Records]].\n\n[[Norman Whitfield]] was a producer at Motown, renowned for creating innovative \"[[psychedelic soul]]\" songs. The genre later developed into funk, and from there into disco. [[The Undisputed Truth]], a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song \"[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]\". The disco single \"You + Me = Love\" (number 43) in 1976, which also made number 2 on the [[Dance Club Songs|US Dance Charts]]. In 1977, singer, songwriter and producer [[Willie Hutch]] signed with Whitfield's new label. He had been signed to Motown since 1970, scored a successful disco single with his song [[In and Out (Willie Hutch song)|\"In and Out\"]]. The group [[Rose Royce]] produced the [[Car Wash: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|album soundtrack]] to the 1976 film [[Car Wash (film)|''Car Wash'']], which contained the commercially successful [[Car Wash (song)|song of the same name]].\n\nSinger [[Stacy Lattisaw]] signed with Motown ''after'' achieving success in the disco genre. In 1980, she released her album [[Let Me Be Your Angel (album)|''Let Me Be Your Angel'']], which spawned the disco singles \"[[Dynamite! (Stacy Lattisaw song)|Dynamite]]\" and \"[[Jump to the Beat]]\" on the [[Cotillion Records|Cotillion]] label. Lattisaw continued to enjoy success as a contemporary R&B/pop artist throughout the 1980s. She signed with Motown in 1986, and achieved most success when teaming up with [[Johnny Gill]], releasing the 1989 song [[Where Do We Go from Here (Stacy Lattisaw song)|\"Where Do We Go From Here?\"]] from her last ever album, ''What You Need'', before retiring. In addition, her debut single, in 1979, was a disco cover of \"[[When You're Young and in Love]]\", which was recorded by Motown female group [[the Marvelettes]] in 1967.\n\nAdditionally, the debut single of [[Shalamar]], the group originally created as a disco-driven vehicle by ''Soul Train'' creator [[Don Cornelius]], was \"[[Uptown Festival]]\" (1977), a medley of 10 classic Motown songs sung over a 1970s disco beat.\n\n==Euro disco==\n{{Main|Euro disco}}\n{{Listen\n|filename = Donna Summer I Feel Love.ogg\n|title = Donna Summer \u2013 \"I Feel Love\" (1977)\n|description = [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\" (1977), produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], was a seminal Euro disco song.\n}}\n\n[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 5.png|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[ABBA]] in 1974.]]\n[[File:Dalida19673.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Dalida]] in 1967.]]\nIn the mid to late 1970s, European acts such as [[Silver Convention]] (1974\u20131979), [[Boney M.]] (1974\u20131986), [[Love & Kisses|Love and Kisses]] (1977\u20131982), the ''Munich Sound'' by West Germany-based Donna Summer and producer Giorgio Moroder, whom [[AllMusic]] described as \"one of the principal architects of the disco sound\" with the Donna Summer song \"[[I Feel Love]]\" (1977),<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23915|pure_url=yes}} Giorgio Moroder] Allmusic.com</ref> Moroder's disco music project [[Munich Machine]] (1976\u20131980), as well as [[Jean-Marc Cerrone]] and the [[Village People]], defined the so-called Euro disco sound. The German group [[Kraftwerk]] also had an influence on Euro disco.\n\nBy far the most successful Euro disco act was ABBA. This Swedish quartet, which sang in English, found success with singles such as \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" (1974), \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\" (1976), \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\" (1978), \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\" (1979), and their signature smash hits \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" (1976)\u2014ranks as the [[List of best-selling music artists|eighth best-selling act of all time]].\n\nIn Germany, Boney M. was a Euro disco group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by West German record producer [[Frank Farian]]. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\" (1976) \"[[Ma Baker]]\" (1977) and \"[[Rivers Of Babylon]]\" (1978). Another prominent European [[Pop music|pop]] and disco groups was [[Luv']] from the Netherlands.\n\nIn France, [[Dalida]] released \"[[J'attendrai]]\" (\"I Will Wait\") in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe and Japan. [[Dalida]] successfully adjusted herself to disco era and released at least a dozen of songs that charted among top number 10 in whole Europe and wider. [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released \"La plus belle chose du monde\", a French version of the Bee Gees song \"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\", which became successful in Canada and Europe and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. [[Cerrone]]'s early songs, \"Love in C Minor\" (1976), \"[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]\" (1977) and \"Give Me Love\" (1978)  were successful in the US and Europe. Another Euro disco act was the French diva [[Amanda Lear]], where Euro disco sound is most heard in \"[[Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)]]\" (1978).\n\n[[File:Fotothek df n-15 0000413 Disko.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Dancers at an East German discoth\u00e8que in 1977]]\nIn Italy [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] is the most successful disco act.

The song is also known under its Spanish title \"Para hacer bien el amor hay que venir al sur\" (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song \"J\u00e4tke v\u00f5tmed v\u00e4ljapoole\" was performed by [[Anne Veski]]. \"[[A far l'amore comincia tu]]\" (\"To make love, your move first\") was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as \"En el amor todo es empezar\", in German as \"Liebelei\", in French as \"Puisque tu l'aimes dis le lui\", and in English as \"Do It, Do It Again\".

The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new [[turntablism]] techniques, such as [[beatmatching]] and [[scratching]], a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]], first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable [[pitch control]] and a [[direct drive]] motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure [[soul music|soul]] records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.\n\nIn the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at [[Paradise Garage]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]] and [[Francis Grasso]] became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a [[cult following]] among club-goers, who referred to his DJ sets as \"[[Mass (liturgy)|Saturday Mass]]\". Some DJs would use [[reel to reel tape recorder]]s to make [[remix]]es and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat matched records, the first user of electronic [[effects unit]]s in his mixes and an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies into his mixes, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of [[WKTU]] and [[WBLS]]. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ \u201cprofession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef\u201d.<ref>Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (1999). Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey. Headline Book Publishing Ltd. (updated edition 2000), p. 141.</ref> Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use his own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining his personal sound and aesthetic, and building his own reputation. Known as the first DJ to create a take his audience on a narrative, musical journey, Grasso discovered that music could effectively shift the energy of the crowd, and even more, that he had all this power at his fingertips.\n\n===Early hip hop===\n{{main|Hip hop music}}\nThe disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early hip hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used Chic's \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" as the foundation for their 1979 song \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.\n\nWith synthesizers and [[Krautrock]] influences, that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when [[Afrika Bambaataa]] released the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]],\" spawning a [[hip hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend that includes songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s \"Play at Your Own Risk\" (1982), C Bank's \"One More Shot\" (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s \"Club Underworld\" (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s \"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\" (1983), [[Freeez]]'s \"I.O.U.\" (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s \"Freak-a-Zoid\" (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[I Feel For You]]\" (1984).\n\n===Post-disco and EDM {{Anchor|1982\u20131990: Post disco and dance}}===\n{{Main|Post-disco|Electronic dance music}}\n{{Listen\n|filename = \n|title = Earth, Wind & Fire \u2014 \"Let's Groove\"(1981)\n|description = \"[[Let's Groove]]\" by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], released in 1981.

Despite the track being a completely different genre, one can notice the beat and sound is influenced by disco; if one compares this song to a disco song.\n}}\nThe transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio [[session musician]]s (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral string section), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of synthesizer [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.\n\nIn addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981\u201383 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and jazz, creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Examples of early-1980s' dance sound performers include [[D Train (music group)|D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered \"[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]\"-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco's popularity.\n\nDuring the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra, his 1981 song ''\"One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)\"'' had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[Symphony|symphonic]] arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]] which also included [[boogie (genre)|boogie]] and [[Italo disco]]. It had an important influence on early [[alternative dance]] and [[dance pop]], and played a key role in the transition between disco and house music during the early 1980s.<ref name=\"AMG1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/post-disco-ma0000012124|title=Post-disco |website=Allmusic |accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-punk {{Anchor|Post punk}}===\n{{Main|Post-punk}}\nThe [[post-punk]] movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported [[punk rock]]'s rule breaking while rejecting its move back to raw [[rock music]].<ref name=Reynolds/> Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.<ref name=Reynolds/> [[Public Image Limited]] is considered the first post-punk group.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's second album ''[[Metal Box]]'' fully embraced the \"studio as instrument\" methodology of disco.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's founder [[John Lydon]], the former lead singer for the [[Sex Pistols]], told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.\n\n[[No wave]] was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City.<ref name=Reynolds/> For shock value, [[James Chance]], a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the ''East Village Eye'' urging his readers to move uptown and get \"trancin' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk\".

Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]] worldwide.\n\nEarly house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] beats, rhythms mainly provided by [[drum machine]]s,<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |title=House : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |website=AllMusic |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006233620/http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> off-beat [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more aggressive [[acid house]] or the minimalist [[microhouse]].

Films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) and ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\n\nDisco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with [[African-American culture|African Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Culture|Hispanic and Latino Americans]], [[Italian Americans]],<ref name=\"Italian\">Shapiro, Peter. \"Turn the Beat Around: The Rise and Fall of Disco\", Macmillan, 2006. p.204\u2013206: \"'Broadly speaking, the typical New York discoth\u00e8que DJ is young (between 18 and 30) and Italian,' journalist Vince Lettie declared in 1975.

Disco can be seen as a reaction by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960's counterculture]] to both the dominance of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco's popularity in the United States, including \u201cthe [[Bump (dance)|Bump]]\u201d and \u201cthe [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]\u201d.\n\nBy the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs such as [[Studio 54]] in New York City, a venue popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive, extravagant and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]] in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[Quaaludes]], the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]] as a reflection of the [[sexual revolution]] of this era in popular history.\n\nDisco was the last popular music movement driven by the [[baby boom generation]]. It began to decline in the United States during 1979\u201380, and by 1982 it had lost nearly all popularity there. [[Disco Demolition Night]], an anti-disco protest held in [[Chicago]] on July 12, 1979, remains the most well-known of several incidents across the country that symbolized disco's declining fortune.\n\nDisco was a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]] in general and [[house music]] in particular. It has had several revivals, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s highly successful 2005 album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', and more recently in the 2010s, entering the pop charts in the US and the UK.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"disco\" is shorthand for the word ''discoth\u00e8que'', a French word for \"library of phonograph records\" derived from \"biblioth\u00e8que\". The word \"discoth\u00e8que\" had the same meaning in English in the 1950s.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|title=The birth of disco|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|date=October 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416163030/http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|archive-date=April 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n\"Discoth\u00e8que\" became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris after these had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960 it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.<ref name=Oxford />\n\nIn the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called \"discotheque dress\" was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form \"disco\" described this dress and has been found in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' of 12 July 1964, but ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.<ref name=Oxford />\n\nVince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the feature article \"Discotheque Rock Paaaaarty\" that appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in September 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1072|title=Playing favourites: Vince Aletti|website=Resident Advisor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/20/paul-morley-disco|title=Paul Morley's showing off ...

[[Lead guitar]] features less frequently in disco than in [[Rock music|rock]]. \"The 'chicken scratch' sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Beginners/en-us/What-the-Funk-!-How-to-Get-That-James-Brown-Sound.aspx|title=What the Funk?!

Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.\n\nThe [[rhythm section|rhythm]] is laid down by prominent, syncopated [[bassline]]s (with heavy use of broken [[octave]]s, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]. The sound was enriched with solo lines and [[harmony part]]s played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]], string section or a full [[string orchestra]].\n\nMost disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the [[rhythm guitar]] and may be implied rather than explicitly present.\n\nSongs often use [[syncopation]], which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the [[bass drum]] hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.\n\nThe orchestral sound is usually known as \"disco sound\" relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background \"pad\" sound defining the [[chord progression|harmony progression]]. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich \"[[wall of sound]]\". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by [[Chic (band)|Chic]].\n\nHarmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords, which are found more often in jazz than pop music.\n\n==Production==\nThe \"disco sound\" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of [[funk]], [[soul music]] of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of \"[[classical music|classical]]\" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).\n\nDisco songs were [[Arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[Orchestration|orchestrators]], and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using [[multitrack recording]] techniques and [[effects unit]]s. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, record producers, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and [[Break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the \"disco sound\" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated [[disco mix]].\n\nEarly records were the \"standard\" three-minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl [[single (music)|singles]] of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five&nbsp;minutes of good-quality music. With the help of Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10\" disc instead of 7\". They cut the next single on a 12\" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. [[Twelve-inch single|12\" single records]], also known as \"[[Maxi single]]s\", quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|title=DISCO History @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121160210/http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|archive-date=January 21, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Disco club culture==\n===U.S. disco nightclubs===\n{{See also|Circuit parties}}\n[[File:Blue disco quad roller skates.jpg|thumb|Blue disco quad [[roller skates]].]]\n\nBy the late 1970s most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were in [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and most notably [[New York City]]. The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and private [[loft]] parties.\n\nIn the 1970s, notable discos included \"[[Crisco Disco]]\", \"The Sanctuary\", \"Leviticus\", \"[[Studio 54]]\" and \"[[Paradise Garage]]\" in New York, \"Artemis\" in Philadelphia, \"Studio One\" in Los Angeles, \"Dugan's Bistro\" in Chicago, and \"The Library\" in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|title=Once a Hot Disco, Now a Cool Opportunity \u2013 Philadelphia Magazine|date=May 18, 2016|website=Phillymag.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028004100/http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|archive-date=October 28, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Disco197510/>\n\nIn the late 70s, \"[[Studio 54]]\" in [[New York City]] was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general. It was operated by [[Steve Rubell]] and [[Ian Schrager]] and was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the \"[[Man in the Moon]]\" that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].\n\nThe \"[[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]\", another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a [[Barry Manilow]] [[Copacabana (At the Copa)|song of the same name]].\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], large disco clubs such as \"The Pier\" (\"Pier 9\") and \"The Other Side,\" originally regarded exclusively as \"[[Gay bar|gay bars,\"]] became particularly popular among the capital area's gay and straight college students in the late 70s.\n\n===Sound and light equipment===\n[[File:Dance floor 2 by harmon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Major disco clubs had lighted dance floors, with the lights flashing to complement the beat.]]\n[[File:ZMF 2015 IMGP 0000.jpg|thumb|The reflective light [[disco ball]] was a fixture on the ceilings of many discoth\u00e8ques.]]\nPowerful, bass-heavy, [[hi-fi]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. \"Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of [[subwoofer]]s positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade [[sound engineer]]s such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.\"<ref name=\"timlawrence.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.timlawrence.info/articles2/2013/7/16/beyond-the-hustle-seventies-social-dancing-discotheque-culture-and-the-emergence-of-the-contemporary-club-dancer|title=\"Beyond the Hustle: Seventies Social Dancing, Discotheque Culture and the Emergence of the Contemporary Club Dancer\".

DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a [[DJ mixer]] and using a [[microphone]] to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as [[reverb]], equalization, and echo [[effects unit]]. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include [[Francis Grasso]] of The Sanctuary, [[David Mancuso]] of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], [[Frankie Knuckles]] of the Chicago [[Warehouse (nightclub)|Warehouse]], [[Larry Levan]] of the [[Paradise Garage]], [[Nicky Siano]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[Karen Mixon Cook]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]], Richie Kulala of [[Studio 54]] and Rick Salsalini.\n\nSome DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the [[recording studio]]. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific record producer as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in leading nightclubs, DJs were also influential for the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.\n\n===Disco dancing===\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura162.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Disco dancers typically wore loose slacks for men and flowing dresses for women, which enabled ease of movement on the dance floor.]]\nIn the early years, dancers in discos danced in a \"hang loose\" or \"freestyle\" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the \"Bump\", \"Penguin\", \"Boogaloo\", \"Watergate\" and \"Robot\". By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|the Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].<ref name=\"Disco197510\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&pg=840,3518488&dq=disco+music&hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975</ref>\n\nDuring the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ''\"touch dancing\"'', ''\"the hustle\"'', and ''\"[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]]\"''. The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book ''The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing'' (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book topped the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.\n\nIn Chicago, the ''Step By Step'' disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that [[Don Cornelius]] used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''Step by Step'''s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show which aired on Saturday mornings had a following of dancers who would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as \"Disco Night at White Sox Park\".\n\nSome notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn [[Reality TV|dance competition TV shows]] such as ''[[Dance Fever]]'' (1979).\n\n===Disco fashion===\nDisco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore glamorous, expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as [[Halston]] dresses or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless [[halter top]]s, [[disco pants]], \"hot pants\" or body-hugging [[spandex]] bodywear or \"catsuits\".<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|title=Disco Fashion: That's the way They Liked It|website=The Ultimate History Project|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006032157/http://ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Men would wear shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore [[Pierre Cardin]] suits, [[three piece suit]]s with a vest and [[Double knitting|double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the [[leisure suit]].

In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, [[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as \u201cpoured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality.\u201d<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\">Bill Brewster/Frank Broughton: ''Last Night a DJ Saved my Life: The History of the Disc Jockey.'' London: Headline 1999, pp. 136-148.</ref> The Sanctuary was the \u201cfirst totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America\u201d and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, the bathrooms and the hallwasy of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy like sexual engagements.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> By describing the music, drugs and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. This supports the argument that the disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. Further, this coupled with the recent legalization of abortions, the introduction of antibiotics and the pill all facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment fostering a very sex positive framework around discotheques.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> Given that at this time all instances of oral and anal gay sex were considered deviant and illegal acts in New York state, this sexual freedom can be considered quite liberatory and resistant to dominant oppressive structures.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> Further, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] classified homosexuality as an illness.<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/> This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. Davis Mancuso's club/house party, [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], was described as having a \"[[pansexual]] attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually cariried bail money with them.\"<ref name=\"Brewster_Disco\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===First discotheques===\nDisco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band.

The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of race riots, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy and the [[Watergate]] scandal left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless.  The start of the \u201970s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Turn the Beat Around: the Secret History of Disco |url=https://archive.org/details/turnbeataround00pete |date=2005 |publisher=Faber |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture'', [[Simon Frith]] highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. \"The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie\", he says. \"The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.\"<ref>Alan McKee, ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture''.

But at The Loft and many other early, private [[discotheque]]s, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, policies. [[Vince Aletti]] described it \"like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else,\" and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying \"It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups.

Those genres, mainly African-American ones, would influence much of early disco music.\n\nDuring the 60s, the Motown record label developed a popular and influential [[Motown sound|own sound]], described as having \"1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were half way between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-motown-story-19710513|title=The Motown Story|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> Motown had many hits with early disco elements by acts like [[the Supremes]] (for instance \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" in 1966), [[Stevie Wonder]] (for instance \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" in 1972), [[The Jackson 5]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]] (\"[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']]\" in 1973).\n\nIn the mid-1960s and early 1970s [[Philadelphia soul]] and [[New York soul]] developed as sub-genres that also had lavish [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], lush [[string orchestra]] arrangements and expensive record production processes.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s musicians and audiences from the Black, Italian and Latino communities adopted several traits from the [[hippie]] and [[psychedelia]] subcultures.

Hold On]].\n\nEarly disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as [[Salsoul Records]] (Ken, Stanley, and [[Joseph Cayre]]), [[West End Records]] ([[Mel Cheren]]), [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] (Neil Bogart), and [[Prelude Records (record label)|Prelude]] (Marvin Schlachter), to name a few. The genre was also shaped by [[Tom Moulton]], who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs \u2014 thus creating the extended mix or \"[[remix]]\", going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12\" record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the \"disco sound\" included David Mancuso, [[Nicky Siano]], [[Shep Pettibone]], [[Larry Levan]], [[Walter Gibbons]], and Chicago-based [[Frankie Knuckles]]. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.\n\nDisco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show ''Soul Train'' in 1971 hosted by [[Don Cornelius]], then [[Marty Angelo]]'s ''[[Disco Step-by-Step Television Show]]'' in 1975, Steve Marcus' ''Disco Magic/Disco 77'', Eddie Rivera's ''Soap Factory'', and [[Merv Griffin]]'s ''[[Dance Fever]]'', hosted by [[Deney Terrio]], who is credited with teaching actor [[John Travolta]] to dance for his role in the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', as well as DANCE, based out of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].\n\nIn 1974, New York City's [[WPIX-FM]] premiered the first disco radio show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discosavvy.com/discoearly70s.html|title=The First Years of Disco (1972-1974)|website=discosavvy.com|access-date=2019-06-18|quote=In November 1974, WPIX FM launched the world's first disco radio show, \"Disco 102\", hosted by Steve Andrews for 4 hours every Saturday night.}}</ref>\n\n==== Norman Whitfield ====\nAs a producer and songwriter [[Norman Whitfield]] had helped to develop the Motown sound in the 1960s with many hits for [[Marvin Gaye]], [[the Velvelettes]], the Temptations and [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]]. From around the production of the Temptations' album ''[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations album)|Cloud Nine]]'' in 1968 he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. A clear example of such a long psychedelic soul track is \"[[Papa Was a Rollin' Stone]]\", which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12\" version. By the early 70s, many of his productions had evolved more and more towards funk and disco, as heard on albums by [[the Undisputed Truth]] and the 1973 album ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]'' by [[The Jackson 5]]. After he left Motown in 1975 he produced some more disco hits, including \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\" (1976) by [[Rose Royce]].\n\n==== Disco culture in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1970s ====\nIn the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] scene and formed the [[northern soul]] movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent) and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as [[Little Anthony & the Imperials]] and [[Jackie Wilson]].\n\nIn 1974 there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events. [[Glam rock]] tracks were popular, with for example [[Gary Glitter]]'s 1972 single \"[[Rock and Roll Part 2]]\" becoming popular on UK dance floors while it did not get any radio airplay.<ref>Reynolds, Simon (2016).

Starting in the 1980s, [[country music]] began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. The continued popularity of [[power pop]] and the revival of [[oldies]] in the late 1970s was also related to disco's decline; the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was [[John Travolta]], who in 1977 had starred in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.\n\nDuring this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] purchased [[ABC Records]], absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. [[Midsong International Records]] ceased operations in 1980. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981 and [[TK Records]] closed in the same year. [[Salsoul Records]] continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|title=Salsoul Records @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014151424/http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Casablanca Records]] had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nMany groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success\u2014even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. [[The Bee Gees]], for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989's \"[[One (Bee Gees song)|One]]\") and three more top-40 songs (despite recording and releasing far more than that and completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs) in the United States after the 1970s, even though numerous songs they wrote and had ''other'' artists perform were successful. Of the handful of groups ''not'' taken down by disco's fall from favor, [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Donna Summer]], [[the Jacksons]]\u2014and [[Michael Jackson]] in particular\u2014stand out: In spite of having helped ''define'' the disco sound early on,<ref>''[[Jackson 5: The Ultimate Collection]]'' (1996), liner notes.</ref> they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s.\n\nSix months prior to the chaotic event (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI ([[WLS-FM]]) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that also competed against WDAI at the time, [[WGCI-FM]], would later incorporate [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the [[Chicago house]] genre to the airwaves.\n\n====Factors contributing to disco's decline====\nFactors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] from the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles led by participants.<ref name=\"BeeGees\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3652|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic BeeGees bio]</ref> In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the \"Disco sucks\" movement as implicitly [[machism|macho]] and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.<ref name=allmusicdisco/><ref name=espn/><ref name=Campion/> It was also interpreted being part of a wider cultural \"backlash\" towards conservatism,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jun/18/disco-sucks Ben Myers: \"Why 'Disco sucks!' sucked\"], in: [[The Guardian]], June 18, 2009, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref> that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the [[United States Senate]] for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the [[Religious Right]] around the same time.\n\nIn January 1979, rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] argued that [[homophobia]], and most likely [[racism]], were reasons behind the movement,<ref name=Christgau/> a conclusion seconded by [[John Rockwell]].

What a Feeling]]\" (theme to the film ''[[Flashdance (film)|Flashdance]]'') and the [[Fame (Irene Cara song)|theme song]] to the film ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (later re-sung by [[Erica Gimpel]] for the [[Fame (1982 TV series)|TV show of the same name]]), Michael Jackson's \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\" and \"[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]\", and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s first album\u2013all which had strong disco influences. Record producer Giorgio Moroder's soundtracks to ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'' and ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (which also had a heavy disco influence) proved that the style was still very much embraced. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1982 album, ''[[Hot Space]]'' was inspired by the genre as well.\n\nTo a significant extent, the transition from disco to 80s dance music was one of relabeling. The ''word'' \"disco\" simply became unfashionable to use when describing new music. As late as 1983, [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]] had a major hit single, \"[[Give It Up (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Give It Up]]\", which was not considered disco, even though it would have been considered to be in the heart of the genre if it had been released four years earlier.\n\nIn 1980's [[house music]], and [[Chicago house]] in particular, a strong disco influence\u2014mediated by subgenres like [[post disco]] and [[Italo disco]]\u2014was constantly present, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping [[electronic dance music]] and contemporary club culture, is often described being \"disco's revenge\".<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg85ab/house-music-is-discos-revenge-a-look-at-the-early-days-of-american-house \"House Music is Disco\u2019s Revenge: A Look at the Early Days of American House\"], in: [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] magazine, September 9, 2014, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, disco and its legacy also became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs and films were released that referenced disco. Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included [[Deee-Lite]]'s \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\" (1990), [[U2]]'s \"[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]\" (1993), [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]\" (1994) & \"Entertain Me\" (1995), [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s \"[[Disco 2000 (song)|Disco 2000]]\" (1995), and [[Jamiroquai]]'s \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" (1999), while films such as ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.\n\n===2000\u2013present: Success of nu-disco and disco revival===\n{{main|Nu-disco}}\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura159.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Students from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]] dancing to disco during a cultural event on campus]]\nIn the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called \"nu-disco\" began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like [[Daft Punk]]'s \"[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]\" and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s \"[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love At First Sight]]\" and \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with [[funky house]], such as [[Spiller]]'s \"[[Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)]]\" and [[Modjo]]'s \"[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]\", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2000. [[Robbie Williams]]' disco single \"[[Rock DJ]]\" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] released a disco song, \"Miss Europa Disco Dancer\", in 2001. The song's disco influence, which appears on ''[[Know Your Enemy (Manic Street Preachers album)|Know Your Enemy]]'', was described as being \"much-discussed\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture1|title=Condemned to rock'n'roll|first=Garry|last=Mulholland|date=March 16, 2001|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=December 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224140032/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture1|archive-date=February 24, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s, and released her album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' to rave reviews. In addition to that, her song \"[[Hung Up]]\" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled [[ABBA]]'s 1979 song \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her [[Confessions Tour]] also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the [[roller derby]].\n\nThe success of the \"nu-disco\" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: \"The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It\u2019s a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. [[Madison Avenue (band)|Madison Avenue]] look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid.

The show's success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to stage, and to record charts, Discoth\u00e8que Divas like Lady Zu and As Fren\u00e9ticas.\n\nOther top-10 entries from 2015 like [[Mark Ronson]]'s disco groove-infused \"[[Uptown Funk]]\", [[Maroon 5]]'s \"[[Sugar (Maroon 5 song)|Sugar]]\", [[the Weeknd]]'s \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\" and [[Jason Derulo]]'s \"[[Want to Want Me|Want To Want Me]]\" also ascended the charts and have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared with his new album ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Giorgio Moroder album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' in 2015 which has proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like \"[[I Don't Like It, I Love It]]\" by [[Flo Rida]], \"[[Adventure of a Lifetime]]\" by [[Coldplay]], \"[[Back Together (Robin Thicke song)|Back Together]]\" by [[Robin Thicke]] and \"[[Levels (Nick Jonas song)|Levels]]\" by [[Nick Jonas]] feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs are showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that have been dominating the current charts. Justin Timberlake's 2016 song \"[[Can't Stop the Feeling!]]\", which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the history of the chart.

Her 1980 dance classics \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" and \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\" were written and produced by [[Nile Rogers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of the group [[Chic]]. [[The Supremes]], the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976's \"[[I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking]]\" and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's \"You're My Driving Wheel\".\n\nAt the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, [[Marvin Gaye]] released \"[[Got to Give It Up]]\" in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre, and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye's songs have disco elements, including [[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]] (1975). [[Stevie Wonder]] released the disco single \"[[Sir Duke]]\" in 1977 as a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], the influential [[jazz]] legend who had died in 1974. [[Smokey Robinson]] left the Motown group [[the Miracles]] for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album ''[[A Quiet Storm]]'' in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the \"Quiet Storm\" musical programming format and subgenre of R&B. It contained the disco single \"[[Baby That's Backatcha]]\". Other Motown artists who scored disco hits include: Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with [[Love Machine (The Miracles song)|\"Love Machine\"]] (1975), [[Eddie Kendricks]] with [[Keep on Truckin' (song)|\"Keep On Truckin'\"]] (1973), [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]] with \"[[Down to Love Town]]\" (1976) and [[Thelma Houston]] with her cover of the [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] song \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\" (1976). The label continued to release successful disco songs into the 1980s with [[Rick James]]' \"[[Super Freak]]\" (1981), and the [[Commodores]]' \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\" (1981).\n\nSeveral of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. [[Mary Wells]], Motown's first female superstar with her signature song \"[[My Guy]]\" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song [[Gigolo (Mary Wells song)|\"Gigolo\"]] in 1980. [[Jimmy Ruffin]], the elder brother of [[the Temptations]] lead singer [[David Ruffin]], was also signed to Motown, and released his most successful and well-known song \"[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]\" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song \"[[Hold On (To My Love)]]\", which was written and produced by [[Robin Gibb]] of the Bee Gees, for his album ''[[Sunrise (Jimmy Ruffin album)|Sunrise]]''. [[Edwin Starr]], known for his Motown protest song \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, \"[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|Contact]]\" and \"[[H.A.P.P.Y. Radio (song)|H.A.P.P.Y. Radio]]\".\n\n[[Kiki Dee]] became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, ''Great Expectations'' (1970), and two singles \"The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday\" (1970) and \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" (1971), the latter giving her first ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with [[Elton John]]'s [[The Rocket Record Company]], and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with [[Tammi Terrell]] and [[Kim Weston]]. Michael Jackson released many successful solo singles under the Motown label, like [[Got to Be There (song)|\"Got To Be There\"]] (1971), [[Ben (song)|\"Ben\"]] (1972) and a cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s [[Rockin' Robin (song)|\"Rockin' Robin\"]] (1972). He went on to score hits in the disco genre with \"[[Rock with You]]\" (1979), \"[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]\" (1979) and \"[[Billie Jean]]\" (1983) for [[Epic Records]].\n\nMany Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. Michael Jackson was the lead singer of [[the Jackson 5]], one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s. They left the record company in 1975 ([[Jermaine Jackson]], however, remained with the label) after successful songs like \"[[I Want You Back]]\" (1969) and \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" (1970), and even the disco song \"[[Dancing Machine]]\" (1974). Renamed as 'the Jacksons' (as Motown owned the name 'the Jackson 5'), they went on to find success with disco songs like \"Blame It on the Boogie\" (1978), \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" (1979) and \"Can You Feel It?\" (1981) on the Epic label. [[the Isley Brothers]], whose short tenure at the company had produced the song \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like [[That Lady (song)|\"That Lady\"]] (1973) and \"[[It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)]]\" (1979). [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]], who recorded the most successful version of \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as \"Baby, Don't Change Your Mind\" (1977) and \"Bourgie, Bourgie\" (1980) in the disco era.\n\n[[The Detroit Spinners]] were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song \"[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]\" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow [[Detroit]] native [[Aretha Franklin]], to [[Atlantic Records]], and there had disco songs like \"[[The Rubberband Man]]\" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's \"[[Are You Ready for Love]]\", as well as a medley of [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]' song \"[[Working My Way Back to You]]\" and Michael Zager's \"Forgive Me, Girl\". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, ''[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]'' (1972) \u2013 to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, [[The Night (Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song)|\"The Night\"]], was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the [[Northern Soul]] circuit, reached number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song \"[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]\" (1975) for [[Warner Curb Records]].\n\n[[Norman Whitfield]] was a producer at Motown, renowned for creating innovative \"[[psychedelic soul]]\" songs. The genre later developed into funk, and from there into disco. [[The Undisputed Truth]], a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song \"[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]\". The disco single \"You + Me = Love\" (number 43) in 1976, which also made number 2 on the [[Dance Club Songs|US Dance Charts]]. In 1977, singer, songwriter and producer [[Willie Hutch]] signed with Whitfield's new label. He had been signed to Motown since 1970, scored a successful disco single with his song [[In and Out (Willie Hutch song)|\"In and Out\"]]. The group [[Rose Royce]] produced the [[Car Wash: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|album soundtrack]] to the 1976 film [[Car Wash (film)|''Car Wash'']], which contained the commercially successful [[Car Wash (song)|song of the same name]].\n\nSinger [[Stacy Lattisaw]] signed with Motown ''after'' achieving success in the disco genre. In 1980, she released her album [[Let Me Be Your Angel (album)|''Let Me Be Your Angel'']], which spawned the disco singles \"[[Dynamite! (Stacy Lattisaw song)|Dynamite]]\" and \"[[Jump to the Beat]]\" on the [[Cotillion Records|Cotillion]] label. Lattisaw continued to enjoy success as a contemporary R&B/pop artist throughout the 1980s. She signed with Motown in 1986, and achieved most success when teaming up with [[Johnny Gill]], releasing the 1989 song [[Where Do We Go from Here (Stacy Lattisaw song)|\"Where Do We Go From Here?\"]] from her last ever album, ''What You Need'', before retiring.

Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\" (1976) \"[[Ma Baker]]\" (1977) and \"[[Rivers Of Babylon]]\" (1978). Another prominent European [[Pop music|pop]] and disco groups was [[Luv']] from the Netherlands.\n\nIn France, [[Dalida]] released \"[[J'attendrai]]\" (\"I Will Wait\") in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe and Japan. [[Dalida]] successfully adjusted herself to disco era and released at least a dozen of songs that charted among top number 10 in whole Europe and wider. [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released \"La plus belle chose du monde\", a French version of the Bee Gees song \"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\", which became successful in Canada and Europe and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. [[Cerrone]]'s early songs, \"Love in C Minor\" (1976), \"[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]\" (1977) and \"Give Me Love\" (1978)  were successful in the US and Europe.

A [[DJ mixer]] is placed between two [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]] turntables.]]\n\nThe rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and [[DJ mixer]]s to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new [[turntablism]] techniques, such as [[beatmatching]] and [[scratching]], a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]], first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable [[pitch control]] and a [[direct drive]] motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure [[soul music|soul]] records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.\n\nIn the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at [[Paradise Garage]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]] and [[Francis Grasso]] became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a [[cult following]] among club-goers, who referred to his DJ sets as \"[[Mass (liturgy)|Saturday Mass]]\". Some DJs would use [[reel to reel tape recorder]]s to make [[remix]]es and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat matched records, the first user of electronic [[effects unit]]s in his mixes and an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies into his mixes, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of [[WKTU]] and [[WBLS]]. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ \u201cprofession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef\u201d.<ref>Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (1999). Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey. Headline Book Publishing Ltd. (updated edition 2000), p. 141.</ref> Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use his own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining his personal sound and aesthetic, and building his own reputation. Known as the first DJ to create a take his audience on a narrative, musical journey, Grasso discovered that music could effectively shift the energy of the crowd, and even more, that he had all this power at his fingertips.\n\n===Early hip hop===\n{{main|Hip hop music}}\nThe disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early hip hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used Chic's \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" as the foundation for their 1979 song \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.\n\nWith synthesizers and [[Krautrock]] influences, that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when [[Afrika Bambaataa]] released the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]],\" spawning a [[hip hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend that includes songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s \"Play at Your Own Risk\" (1982), C Bank's \"One More Shot\" (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s \"Club Underworld\" (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s \"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\" (1983), [[Freeez]]'s \"I.O.U.\" (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s \"Freak-a-Zoid\" (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[I Feel For You]]\" (1984).\n\n===Post-disco and EDM {{Anchor|1982\u20131990: Post disco and dance}}===\n{{Main|Post-disco|Electronic dance music}}\n{{Listen\n|filename = \n|title = Earth, Wind & Fire \u2014 \"Let's Groove\"(1981)\n|description = \"[[Let's Groove]]\" by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], released in 1981.

Despite the track being a completely different genre, one can notice the beat and sound is influenced by disco; if one compares this song to a disco song.\n}}\nThe transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio [[session musician]]s (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral string section), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of synthesizer [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.\n\nIn addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981\u201383 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and jazz, creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Examples of early-1980s' dance sound performers include [[D Train (music group)|D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered \"[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]\"-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco's popularity.\n\nDuring the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra, his 1981 song ''\"One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)\"'' had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[Symphony|symphonic]] arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]] which also included [[boogie (genre)|boogie]] and [[Italo disco]]. It had an important influence on early [[alternative dance]] and [[dance pop]], and played a key role in the transition between disco and house music during the early 1980s.<ref name=\"AMG1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/post-disco-ma0000012124|title=Post-disco |website=Allmusic |accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Post-punk {{Anchor|Post punk}}===\n{{Main|Post-punk}}\nThe [[post-punk]] movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported [[punk rock]]'s rule breaking while rejecting its move back to raw [[rock music]].<ref name=Reynolds/> Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.<ref name=Reynolds/> [[Public Image Limited]] is considered the first post-punk group.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's second album ''[[Metal Box]]'' fully embraced the \"studio as instrument\" methodology of disco.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's founder [[John Lydon]], the former lead singer for the [[Sex Pistols]], told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.\n\n[[No wave]] was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City.<ref name=Reynolds/> For shock value, [[James Chance]], a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the ''East Village Eye'' urging his readers to move uptown and get \"trancin' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk\".

House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more aggressive [[acid house]] or the minimalist [[microhouse]].
