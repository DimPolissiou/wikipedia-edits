They also established a trading post in [[Riau]], others in the region being the [[Strait Settlements]] in [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], while the Dutch wrestled the port of [[Malacca]] from the Portuguese in 1641.

One eminent critic, living in the tenth and eleventh-century [[Syria]] was the blind poet [[Al-Ma'arri]]. He became well known for a poetry that was affected by a \"pervasive pessimism.\" He labeled religions in general as \"noxious weeds\" and said that Islam does not have a monopoly on truth. He had particular contempt for the ''[[ulema]]'', writing that:\n\n{{quotation|They recite their sacred books, although the fact informs me that these are fiction from first to last.

Ozim sets out to follow his orders, but gets stopped by an evil angel on the way. The ignorant Ozim believes him to be the same angel that spoke to Osius before.

In his book, titled ''Islam and the Psychology of the Musulman'', Servier wrote that \"The only thing Arabs ever invented was their religion. And this religion is, precisely, the main obstacle between them and us\". Servier describes Islam as a \"religious nationalism in which every Muslim brain is steeped\".

All this has been tried already, and has miserably failed. The Koran has so encrusted the religion in a hard unyielding casement of ordinances and social laws, that if the shell be broken the life is gone. A rationalistic Islam would be Islam no longer. The contrast between our own faith and Islam is most remarkable. There are in our Scriptures living germs of truth, which accord with civil and religious liberty, and will expand with advancing civilisation. In Islam it is just the reverse. The Koran has no such teaching as with us has abolished polygamy, slavery, and arbitrary divorce, and has elevated woman to her proper place. As a Reformer, Mahomet did advance his people to a certain point, but as a Prophet he left them fixed immovably at that point for all time to come. The tree is of artificial planting.

Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property \u2013 either as a child, a wife, or a concubine \u2013 must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

In many ways, local populations found Muslim rule more flexible and tolerant than that of Byzantium and Persia. Religious communities were free to practice their faith to worship and be governed by their religious leaders and laws in such areas as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In exchange, they were required to pay tribute, a poll tax (''jizya'') that entitled them to Muslim protection from outside aggression and exempted them from military service.

Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7).<ref name=\"Brockopp\"/> The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran.<ref name=\"Esposito\">John L Esposito (1998) p. 79</ref>\n<ref>{{Quran-usc|24|33}}</ref> Murray Gordon notes that this ban is \"of no small significance.\"<ref>Gordon 1989, page 37.</ref> Brockopp writes: \"Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an.

By legitimizing slavery and \u2013 by extension \u2013 traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery.

He then sends an angel to the monk Osius who orders him to preach to the Arabs. Osius however is in ill-health and orders a young monk, Ozim, to carry out the angel's orders instead. Ozim sets out to follow his orders, but gets stopped by an evil angel on the way. The ignorant Ozim believes him to be the same angel that spoke to Osius before.

The contrast between our own faith and Islam is most remarkable. There are in our Scriptures living germs of truth, which accord with civil and religious liberty, and will expand with advancing civilisation. In Islam it is just the reverse. The Koran has no such teaching as with us has abolished polygamy, slavery, and arbitrary divorce, and has elevated woman to her proper place. As a Reformer, Mahomet did advance his people to a certain point, but as a Prophet he left them fixed immovably at that point for all time to come. The tree is of artificial planting.

Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property \u2013 either as a child, a wife, or a concubine \u2013 must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

Nevertheless, among these Mohammedans, wherever there has a philosophic man, he was sure to protest against these cruelties.

There has not been a religion that has clung to this dualism more than that founded by the Prophet of Arabia, and there has not been a religion, which has shed so much blood and been so cruel to other men. In the Koran there is the doctrine that a man who does not believe these teachings should be killed, it is a mercy to kill him! And the surest way to get to heaven, where there are beautiful houris and all sorts of sense enjoyments, is by killing these unbelievers.

If one does not take the standard of reason, there cannot be any true judgment, even in the case of religions. One religion may ordain something very hideous. For instance, the Mohammedan religion allows Mohammedans to kill all who are not of their religion. It is clearly stated in the Koran, Kill the infidels if they do not become Mohammedans. They must be put to fire and sword. Now if we tell a Mohammedan that this is wrong, he will naturally ask, \"How do you know that? How do you know it is not good?

They are therefore aggressive. Bullying is the natural excrescence of an aggressive spirit. The Hindu has an ages old civilization. He is essentially non violent. His civilization has passed through the experiences that the two recent ones are still passing through. If Hinduism was ever imperialistic in the modern sense of the term, it has outlived its imperialism and has either deliberately or as a matter of course given it up. Predominance of the non violent spirit has restricted the use of arms to a small minority which must always be subordinate to a civil power highly spiritual, learned and selfless. The Hindus as a body are therefore not equipped for fighting. But not having retained their spiritual training, they have forgotten the use of an effective substitute for arms and not knowing their use nor having an aptitude for them, they have become docile to the point of timidity and cowardice.

Submission and humility, two significant components of Islamic spirituality, are disregarded as major failings of Islam, not as virtues.

This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand.

They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the [[spice trade]].

Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as [[Procopius]], [[Nonnosus]], or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac.

In many ways, local populations found Muslim rule more flexible and tolerant than that of Byzantium and Persia. Religious communities were free to practice their faith to worship and be governed by their religious leaders and laws in such areas as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In exchange, they were required to pay tribute, a poll tax (''jizya'') that entitled them to Muslim protection from outside aggression and exempted them from military service. Thus, they were called the \"protected ones\" (''dhimmi'').

Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7).<ref name=\"Brockopp\"/> The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran.<ref name=\"Esposito\">John L Esposito (1998) p. 79</ref>\n<ref>{{Quran-usc|24|33}}</ref> Murray Gordon notes that this ban is \"of no small significance.\"<ref>Gordon 1989, page 37.</ref> Brockopp writes: \"Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an.

He did not set out to abolish slavery, but rather to improve the conditions of slaves by urging his followers to treat their slaves humanely and free them as a way of expiating one's sins which some modern Muslim authors have interpreted as indication that Muhammad envisioned a gradual abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC&pg=PA19|pages=19\u201320|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=1989|isbn=9780941533300}}</ref>\n\nCritics say it was only in the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]) that slavery gradually became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as [[UK|Britain]] and [[France]].<ref name=\"eois\" /> Gordon describes the lack of homegrown Islamic abolition movements as owing much to the fact that it was deeply anchored in Islamic law. By legitimizing slavery and \u2013 by extension \u2013 traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery.
