It corresponds to the [[call-and-response]] pattern in human [[communication]] and is found as a basic element of [[musical form]], such as [[verse-chorus form]], in many traditions.\n\n==African music==\nIn [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n cultures, call and response is a pervasive pattern of [[democracy|democratic]] participation\u2014in public gatherings in the discussion of civic affairs, in religious [[ritual]]s, as well as in vocal and instrumental [[West African music|musical]] expression.<ref>Courlander, Harold, ''A Treasury of Afro-American Folklore: The Oral Literature, Traditions, Recollections, Legends, Tales, Songs, Religious Beliefs, Customs, Sayings and Humor of People of African Descent in the Americas''.

These include [[Soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[funk]] and [[hip hop]].

Call and response is widely present in parts of the Americas touched by the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. The tradition of call and response fosters dialogue and its legacy continues on today, as it is an important component of oral traditions. Both [[African-American women work songs]], African American work songs, and the [[work song]] in general use the call and response format often. \nIt can also be found in the music of the Afro west indies Caribbean populations of Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize. and many nations of the diaspora especially that of South Americas Brazil.\n\n==Cuban music (Salsa, Son, etc)==\nKnown as [[Coro-preg\u00f3n]], it is extensively used in [[Cuban music]] and derives from African musical elements, both in the secular [[Cuban rumba|rumba]]<ref>Orovio, Helio 2004.

In his motet [[Komm, Jesu, komm, BWV 229|''Komm, Jesu, komm'']], Bach uses eight voices deployed as two antiphonal choirs.  According to [[John Eliot Gardiner]], in this \u201cintimate and touching\u201d work, Bach \u201cgoes many steps beyond the manipulation of spatially separate blocks of sound\u201d and \u201cfinds ways of weaving all eight lines into a rich contrapuntal tapestry.\u201d <ref> Gardiner, J.

One spectacular example from the 1950s is Karlheinz [[Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Gruppen]]'' for Three Orchestras (1955\u20131957), which culminates in a \"synchronized build-up of brass 'points' in the three orchestras ... leading to a climax of chord exchanges from orchestra to orchestra\".<ref>Maconie, R.

(1973, p.163) ''Stockhausen: Life and Work''.  London, Faber.</ref>\n\n==Popular music==\nCall and response is common in modern Western [[popular music]].  Cross-over [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[rock music]] exhibit call-and-response characteristics, as well.  [[The Who]]'s song \"[[My Generation]]\" is an example:<ref name=\"Middleton\">[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]] (1990). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tS7lAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49 Studying Popular Music]''.

But, each A and B part may itself consist of a short call and a short response, and those 2-bar calls and response may also be divided into 1-bar-each call-response pairs:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n*Twelve bars:\n** A: 4-bar CALL\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n** A': 4-bar CALL (repeated with slight variation)\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n** B: 4-bar RESPONSE (repeated)\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE/turnaround\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n\nNote that each turnaround can be considered a call which the next A section is the response to.\n\n==Leader/chorus call and response==\nA single leader makes a musical statement, and then the chorus responds together. American bluesman [[Muddy Waters]] utilizes call and response in one of his signature songs, \"[[Mannish Boy]]\" which is almost entirely leader/chorus call and response.\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Waters' vocal: \"Now when I was a young boy\"\nRESPONSE: (Harmonica/rhythm section riff)\nCALL: Waters': \"At the age of 5\"\nRESPONSE: (Harmonica/rhythm section riff)}}\n\nAnother example is from Chuck Berry's \"[[School Day (Ring Ring Goes the Bell)]]\".\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Drop the coin right into the slot.\nRESPONSE: (Guitar riff)\nCALL: You gotta get something that's really hot.\nRESPONSE: (Guitar riff)}}\n\nA contemporary example is from [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s \"[[Call Me Maybe]]\".\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Hey, I just met you\nRESPONSE: (Violins)\nCALL: And this is crazy\nRESPONSE: (Violins)}}\n\nThis technique is utilized in Jepsen's song several times. While mostly in the chorus, it can also be heard in the breakdown (approximately 2:25) between the vocals (\"It's hard to look right\") and distorted guitar.\n\n==Question/answer call and response==\nPart of the band poses a musical \"question\", or a phrase that feels unfinished, and another part of the band \"answers\" (finishes) it. In the blues, the B section often has a question-and-answer pattern (dominant-to-tonic).\n\nAn example of this is the Christmas song \"[[Must Be Santa (song)|Must Be Santa]]\":\n{{poemquote|CALL: Who laughs this way, ho ho ho?\nRESPONSE: Santa laughs this way, ho ho ho!}}\n\nA similar question-and-answer exchange occurs in the movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' between Sam and the band in the song \"Knock On Wood\":\n{{poemquote|CALL: Who's got trouble?\nRESPONSE: We've got trouble!\nCALL: How much trouble?\nRESPONSE: Too much trouble!}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiphon]]\n* [[Countersubject]]\n* [[Responsory]]\n* [[Military cadence]]\n* [[African-American women work songs]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010154112/http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/blues-concepts/call-and-response/ Call and Response in Blues] - with references to blues songs and historical evolution.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321030004/http://bostoncommunitychoir.org/history_of_gospel_music.htm History of Gospel Music] - with references to call and response in black gospel music\n*[http://www.uncloudydays.com Gospel Music History] - Gospel Music Encyclopedia citing the origins of the different types of call and response and different gospel music style\n\n{{Jazz theory}}\n{{Musical form}}\n\n[[Category:Musical techniques]]\n[[Category:Jazz techniques]]\n[[Category:Formal sections in music analysis]]\n[[Category:Jazz terminology]]\n[[Category:Kirtan]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|[[call and response]] as a musical pattern|specific types of music|antiphony||Call and response (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|Answer (music)|fugal answer|Fugue#The exposition}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Shave and a Haircut in C.png|thumb|Call: \"[[Shave and a Haircut]]\", Response: \"Two bits\". {{audio|Shave and a Haircut in C.mid|Play}}.]]\nIn music, a '''call and response''' is a succession of two distinct [[phrase (music)|phrases]] usually written in different parts of the music, where the second phrase is heard as a direct commentary on or in response to the first.

But, each A and B part may itself consist of a short call and a short response, and those 2-bar calls and response may also be divided into 1-bar-each call-response pairs:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n*Twelve bars:\n** A: 4-bar CALL\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n** A': 4-bar CALL (repeated with slight variation)\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n** B: 4-bar RESPONSE (repeated)\n***(2-bar vocal CALL\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE]\n***2-bar instrumental RESPONSE/turnaround\n****[1-bar CALL, 1-bar RESPONSE])\n\nNote that each turnaround can be considered a call which the next A section is the response to.\n\n==Leader/chorus call and response==\nA single leader makes a musical statement, and then the chorus responds together. American bluesman [[Muddy Waters]] utilizes call and response in one of his signature songs, \"[[Mannish Boy]]\" which is almost entirely leader/chorus call and response.\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Waters' vocal: \"Now when I was a young boy\"\nRESPONSE: (Harmonica/rhythm section riff)\nCALL: Waters': \"At the age of 5\"\nRESPONSE: (Harmonica/rhythm section riff)}}\n\nAnother example is from Chuck Berry's \"[[School Day (Ring Ring Goes the Bell)]]\".\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Drop the coin right into the slot.\nRESPONSE: (Guitar riff)\nCALL: You gotta get something that's really hot.\nRESPONSE: (Guitar riff)}}\n\nA contemporary example is from [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s \"[[Call Me Maybe]]\".\n\n{{poemquote|CALL: Hey, I just met you\nRESPONSE: (Violins)\nCALL: And this is crazy\nRESPONSE: (Violins)}}\n\nThis technique is utilized in Jepsen's song several times. While mostly in the chorus, it can also be heard in the breakdown (approximately 2:25) between the vocals (\"It's hard to look right\") and distorted guitar.\n\n==Question/answer call and response==\nPart of the band poses a musical \"question\", or a phrase that feels unfinished, and another part of the band \"answers\" (finishes) it. In the blues, the B section often has a question-and-answer pattern (dominant-to-tonic).\n\nAn example of this is the Christmas song \"[[Must Be Santa (song)|Must Be Santa]]\":\n{{poemquote|CALL: Who laughs this way, ho ho ho?\nRESPONSE: Santa laughs this way, ho ho ho!}}\n\nA similar question-and-answer exchange occurs in the movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' between Sam and the band in the song \"Knock On Wood\":\n{{poemquote|CALL: Who's got trouble?\nRESPONSE: We've got trouble!\nCALL: How much trouble?\nRESPONSE: Too much trouble!}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Antiphon]]\n* [[Countersubject]]\n* [[Responsory]]\n* [[Military cadence]]\n* [[African-American women work songs]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010154112/http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/blues-concepts/call-and-response/ Call and Response in Blues] - with references to blues songs and historical evolution.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040321030004/http://bostoncommunitychoir.org/history_of_gospel_music.htm History of Gospel Music] - with references to call and response in black gospel music\n*[http://www.uncloudydays.com Gospel Music History] - Gospel Music Encyclopedia citing the origins of the different types of call and response and different gospel music style\n\n{{Jazz theory}}\n{{Musical form}}\n\n[[Category:Musical techniques]]\n[[Category:Jazz techniques]]\n[[Category:Formal sections in music analysis]]\n[[Category:Jazz terminology]]\n[[Category:Kirtan]]\n", "name_user": "Vmavanti", "label": "safe", "comment": "Applying general fixes for links, HTML, and/or references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_(music)"}
