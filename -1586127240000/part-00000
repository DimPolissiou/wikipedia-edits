The foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] to promote [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].\n\nThe EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amicus curiae]] briefs, defends individuals and new [[Technology|technologies]] from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose [[government]] malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[court]]s, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[Liberty|personal freedoms]] and online civil liberties, maintains a [[database]] and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation]] that it believes would infringe on [[Liberty|personal liberties]] and [[fair use]] and solicits a list of what it considers [[Patent misuse|abusive patents]] with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit (law)|merit]].\n\n==History==\n{{details|Timeline of Electronic Frontier Foundation actions}}\n[[File:EFF Logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|EFF logo used until July 2018]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MitchKapor.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = Mitch Kapor\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = John Gilmore.jpg\n| width2 = 93\n| alt2 = John Gilmore\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = John Perry Barlow cropped.jpg\n| width3 = 111\n| alt3 = John Perry Barlow\n| caption3 = \n| footer = Electronic Frontier Foundation founders [[Mitch Kapor|Kapor]], [[John Gilmore (activist)|Gilmore]] and [[John Perry Barlow|Barlow]]\n}}\n\n===Foundation===\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,<ref name=j1/> and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].\n\nIn April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as \"complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be.\" Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a \"great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBarlow posted an account of this experience to [[The WELL]] online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raids.<ref name=\"j1\">{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=172}}</ref> This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled \"Crime & Puzzlement\" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to \"raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Crime & Puzzlement |last=Barlow |first=John Perry |author-link=John Perry Barlow |date=June 8, 1990 |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |archive-date=2014-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in [[San Francisco]] with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: \"The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself.\"<ref name=\"barlow-history\">{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/not_too_brief_history.html |title=A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation |first=John |last=Barlow |date=November 8, 1990 |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220113/https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/not_too_brief_history.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and [[Stewart Brand]] to join them on the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"barlow-history\" />  Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor.<ref name=\"mission\">{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |title=Formation documents and mission statement for the EFF |date=July 10, 1990 |last1=Kapor |first1=Mitch |author1-link=Mitch Kapor |last2=Barlow |first2=John Perry |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204082735/http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |archive-date=2015-12-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110200326/http://www.weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |archive-date=November 10, 2006 |title=TechnoPolitics |first=Jon |last=Lebkowsky |author-link=Jon Lebkowsky |date=January 11, 1997 |publisher=Weblogsky |access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Mike Godwin]] joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, [[Esther Dyson]] and [[Jerry Berman]] joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992, Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office, and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office.\n\n===Early cases===\nThe creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [[search and seizure]] on [[Steve Jackson Games]] executed by the [[United States Secret Service]] early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state\u2013federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil]]. ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sjgames.com/SS/|title=SJ Games vs. the Secret Service |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |access-date=2018-05-27}}</ref> and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [[search warrant]] for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case]] was the EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which the EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v.

The foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] to promote [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].\n\nThe EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amicus curiae]] briefs, defends individuals and new [[Technology|technologies]] from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose [[government]] malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[court]]s, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[Liberty|personal freedoms]] and online civil liberties, maintains a [[database]] and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation]] that it believes would infringe on [[Liberty|personal liberties]] and [[fair use]] and solicits a list of what it considers [[Patent misuse|abusive patents]] with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit (law)|merit]].\n\n==History==\n{{details|Timeline of Electronic Frontier Foundation actions}}\n[[File:EFF Logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|EFF logo used until July 2018]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MitchKapor.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = Mitch Kapor\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = John Gilmore.jpg\n| width2 = 93\n| alt2 = John Gilmore\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = John Perry Barlow cropped.jpg\n| width3 = 111\n| alt3 = John Perry Barlow\n| caption3 = \n| footer = Electronic Frontier Foundation founders [[Mitch Kapor|Kapor]], [[John Gilmore (activist)|Gilmore]] and [[John Perry Barlow|Barlow]]\n}}\n\n===Foundation===\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,<ref name=j1/> and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].\n\nIn April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as \"complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be.\" Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a \"great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBarlow posted an account of this experience to [[The WELL]] online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raids.<ref name=\"j1\">{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=172}}</ref> This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled \"Crime & Puzzlement\" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to \"raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Crime & Puzzlement |last=Barlow |first=John Perry |author-link=John Perry Barlow |date=June 8, 1990 |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |archive-date=2014-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor.

Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state\u2013federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil]]. ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sjgames.com/SS/|title=SJ Games vs. the Secret Service |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |access-date=2018-05-27}}</ref> and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [[search warrant]] for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case]] was the EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which the EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v.

There were some technical schools in Bardera and Garbaharreey, albeit without curriculum. They are connected through the [[Gedo Education Committee]]. All of Gedo region's high school graduates attended the [[Somali National University]] or affiliated institutions in [[Mogadishu]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nSince the civil war in Somalia, Gedo became one of half dozen regions which have restarted higher education institutions in the country. [[Bardera Polytechnic]], Gedo's first college, and [[University of Gedo]], are both located in Bardera.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to a 1994 [[UNOSOM II]] estimate, the population of Gedo was about 590,000, the majority of the population being from the Marehan, but includes also the Rahanweyn, Ogaden, Harti clans and some Bantu.<ref name=PIUGedo /> Other estimates varied considerably; two reports by the United Nations Development Office for Somalia issued in the same year, 1995, gave very different estimates: 330,000 and about 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia 15 October \u2013 30 October 1998|accessdate=21 August 2014|url = http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ae6a5bd0.pdf|page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimated the total in 2005 as 328,378;<ref name=CEWERU16>Conflict Dynamics International/CEWERU, [http://www.cdint.org/documents/Bottom_Up_Southern_Regions-Conflict-Assesement_CEWERU.pdf \"From the Bottom Up: Southern Regions: Perspectives through Conflict Analysis and Key Political Actors' Mapping\"], September 2013, p.16</ref> and UN estimates from 2014 stand at some 508,000.<ref name=SomPop14 />\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy mostly depends on livestock and farming but the Gedo region has strong interregional and international cross-border trade with Kenya and some extent with Ethiopia. Trade between Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia allowed the Gedo region to be economically stable for the years before the UN intervention and afterwards. The 1998 Nordic Fact Finding Mission prepared a report in Gedo region and found some encouraging economic figures. [[Davidson College]] assistant professor [[Ken Menkhaus]] said that \"Traders in Gedo region made more profit than, for instance, those in Hargeisa, in north-western Somalia.\"<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=3ae6a5bd0 Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia]</ref> Trade going through the border between the three countries were ongoing despite the raging civil war in Somalia for much of the 1990.\n\n==Government==\nGedo region has a 32-member assembly body. The members are directly elected from the seven districts of the region with proportionality according to district population. The Gedo assembly or (Gollaha Gobalka Gedo) works with the federal government based in Mogadishu.

There were some technical schools in Bardera and Garbaharreey, albeit without curriculum. They are connected through the [[Gedo Education Committee]]. All of Gedo region's high school graduates attended the [[Somali National University]] or affiliated institutions in [[Mogadishu]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nSince the civil war in Somalia, Gedo became one of half dozen regions which have restarted higher education institutions in the country. [[Bardera Polytechnic]], Gedo's first college, and [[University of Gedo]], are both located in Bardera.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to a 1994 [[UNOSOM II]] estimate, the population of Gedo was about 590,000, the majority of the population being from the Marehan, but includes also the Rahanweyn, Ogaden, Harti clans and some Bantu.<ref name=PIUGedo /> Other estimates varied considerably; two reports by the United Nations Development Office for Somalia issued in the same year, 1995, gave very different estimates: 330,000 and about 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia 15 October \u2013 30 October 1998|accessdate=21 August 2014|url = http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ae6a5bd0.pdf|page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimated the total in 2005 as 328,378;<ref name=CEWERU16>Conflict Dynamics International/CEWERU, [http://www.cdint.org/documents/Bottom_Up_Southern_Regions-Conflict-Assesement_CEWERU.pdf \"From the Bottom Up: Southern Regions: Perspectives through Conflict Analysis and Key Political Actors' Mapping\"], September 2013, p.16</ref> and UN estimates from 2014 stand at some 508,000.<ref name=SomPop14 />\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy mostly depends on livestock and farming but the Gedo region has strong interregional and international cross-border trade with Kenya and some extent with Ethiopia. Trade between Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia allowed the Gedo region to be economically stable for the years before the UN intervention and afterwards. The 1998 Nordic Fact Finding Mission prepared a report in Gedo region and found some encouraging economic figures. [[Davidson College]] assistant professor [[Ken Menkhaus]] said that \"Traders in Gedo region made more profit than, for instance, those in Hargeisa, in north-western Somalia.\"<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=3ae6a5bd0 Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia]</ref> Trade going through the border between the three countries were ongoing despite the raging civil war in Somalia for much of the 1990.\n\n==Government==\nGedo region has a 32-member assembly body. The members are directly elected from the seven districts of the region with proportionality according to district population. The Gedo assembly or (Gollaha Gobalka Gedo) works with the federal government based in Mogadishu.

In the recent past, [[Luuq]] or Lugh used to be the main political city of Gedo Region but the Somali Civil War made many of the city's residents to flee to other towns.\n\nBardera, the largest city and the seat of the most populous district in Gedo, has become urbanized to the extent that its population multiplied 400% since the breakdown of law and order in the capital of the country, Mogadishu.

One progenitor program was the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a [[Harrier Jump Jet]] replacement for the U.K. [[Royal Navy]] and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; a key technology explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] delta aircraft weighing about {{cvt|24000|lb|kg}} empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the [[Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter]] (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Boeing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |website= Code One Magazine |publisher= Lockheed |title= Common Lightweight Fighter |first= Stadler |last= Rich |date= October 1994}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |title=History (Pre-JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155846/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |archive-date=6 December 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Fighter-Attack (A/F-X) programs cancellations. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post-Cold War defense cuts easing the F-16 service life situation and increasing budget pressure from the USAF's [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]] replacement; the resulting [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12 Avenger II]] was cancelled due to problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), an offshoot of USAF's [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) program, to replace the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the [[Department of Defense]]{{'}}s (DoD) Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellation, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.<ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\"/> JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, instead developing requirements, maturing technologies, and demonstrating concepts for advanced strike warfare.<ref name=\"jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |title=History (JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715052740/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |archive-date=15 July 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.<ref name=\"jast_hist\"/> JAST was subsequently renamed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]],{{refn|Lockheed acquired General Dynamics fighter division at Fort Worth in 1993 and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.|group=N}} and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[Fairchild A-10|A-10]], and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barrie |first1=Douglas |last2=Norris |first2=Guy |last3=Warwick |first3=Graham |date=4 April 1995 |title=Short take-off, low funding |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |work=Flight Global |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172813/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |archive-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInternational participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program.

The forward fuselage was lengthened by {{convert|5|in|cm}} to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved {{convert|2|in|cm}} aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved {{convert|30|in|cm}} aft. The fuselage section was fuller, the top surface raised by {{convert|1|in|cm}} along the centerline to accommodate weapons bays. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV).

The F-35B gained the most, largely due to a 2003 decision to enlarge the weapons bays for commonality between variants; the total weight growth was reportedly up to {{convert|2200|lb}}, over 8%, causing all STOVL key performance parameter (KPP) thresholds to be missed.<ref name=\"Keijsper 2007, p. 119\">Keijsper 2007, p. 119</ref> In December 2003, the STOVL Weight Attack Team (SWAT) was formed to reduce the weight increase; changes included more engine thrust, thinned airframe members, smaller weapons bays and vertical stabilizers, less thrust fed to the roll-post outlets, and redesigning the wing-mate joint, electrical elements, and the airframe immediately aft of the cockpit.<ref>Fulghum, David A. and Robert Wall. \"USAF Plans for Fighters Change\".

Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles and be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. M-Farps can be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs return to rear-area USAF bases or friendly ships for scheduled maintenance. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant alternatives.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:F-35B Ligntining II lands aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) on 17 October 2019 (191017-N-QI061-1159).JPG|thumb|F-35B ''ZM148'' of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]] landing on [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], 2019|alt=]]\n\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy both operate the F-35B, known simply as the Lightning in British service;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/f-35b-lightning/ |title=F-35B Lightning |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> it has replaced the [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier GR9]], which was retired in 2010, and [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR4]], which was retired in 2019.

It is intended to perform both [[Air superiority fighter|air superiority]] and [[attack aircraft|strike]] missions while also providing [[electronic warfare]] and [[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] capabilities. [[Lockheed Martin]] is the prime F-35 contractor, with principal partners [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[BAE Systems]]. The aircraft has three main variants: the [[CTOL|conventional takeoff and landing]] F-35A (CTOL), the [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical-landing]] F-35B (STOVL), and the [[carrier-based]] F-35C (CV/[[CATOBAR]]).\n\nThe aircraft descends from the [[Lockheed Martin X-35]], which in 2001 beat the [[Boeing X-32]] to win the [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program. Its development is principally funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from [[NATO]] and close U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and [[S-400 missile system#Turkey|formerly Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |title= F-35 Global Partnerships |website= lockheedmartin.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120902025203/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |archivedate= 2 September 2012 |publisher= Lockheed Martin |access-date= 31 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Dudley05Mar12\">Dudley, Richard.

One progenitor program was the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a [[Harrier Jump Jet]] replacement for the U.K. [[Royal Navy]] and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; a key technology explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] delta aircraft weighing about {{cvt|24000|lb|kg}} empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the [[Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter]] (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Boeing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |website= Code One Magazine |publisher= Lockheed |title= Common Lightweight Fighter |first= Stadler |last= Rich |date= October 1994}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |title=History (Pre-JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155846/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |archive-date=6 December 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Fighter-Attack (A/F-X) programs cancellations. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post-Cold War defense cuts easing the F-16 service life situation and increasing budget pressure from the USAF's [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]] replacement; the resulting [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12 Avenger II]] was cancelled due to problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), an offshoot of USAF's [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) program, to replace the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the [[Department of Defense]]{{'}}s (DoD) Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellation, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.<ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\"/> JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, instead developing requirements, maturing technologies, and demonstrating concepts for advanced strike warfare.<ref name=\"jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |title=History (JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715052740/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |archive-date=15 July 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.<ref name=\"jast_hist\"/> JAST was subsequently renamed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]],{{refn|Lockheed acquired General Dynamics fighter division at Fort Worth in 1993 and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.|group=N}} and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[Fairchild A-10|A-10]], and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barrie |first1=Douglas |last2=Norris |first2=Guy |last3=Warwick |first3=Graham |date=4 April 1995 |title=Short take-off, low funding |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |work=Flight Global |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172813/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |archive-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInternational participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces that deployed the F-16 and F/A-18 were interested in the JSF.

''The Aviationist'', Retrieved 13 January 2015.</ref>\n\nThe USMC plans to disperse its F-35Bs among forward deployed bases to enhance survivability while remaining close to a battlespace, similar to RAF Harrier deployment in the Cold War, which relied on the use of off-base locations that offered short runways, shelter, and concealment. Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles and be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. M-Farps can be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs return to rear-area USAF bases or friendly ships for scheduled maintenance. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant alternatives.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:F-35B Ligntining II lands aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) on 17 October 2019 (191017-N-QI061-1159).JPG|thumb|F-35B ''ZM148'' of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]] landing on [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], 2019|alt=]]\n\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy both operate the F-35B, known simply as the Lightning in British service;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/f-35b-lightning/ |title=F-35B Lightning |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> it has replaced the [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier GR9]], which was retired in 2010, and [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR4]], which was retired in 2019.

Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms\".<ref name=\"nyt-navels\" /> Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.\n\nTor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, [[Wikipedia]] blocks attempts by Tor users to edit articles unless special permission is sought.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html|title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=10 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 June 2017|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://archive.is/kGv45|archive-date=25 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Onion routing]] is implemented by [[encryption]] in the [[application layer]] of a [[communication protocol]] stack, nested like the layers of an [[onion]]. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination [[IP address]], multiple times and sends it through a [[virtual circuit]] comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of [[encryption]] to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication was partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through [[Computer and network surveillance|network surveillance]] that relies upon knowing its source and destination.<ref name=\"Termanini2018\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVNPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT210|title=The Nano Age of Digital Immunity Infrastructure Fundamentals and Applications: The Intelligent Cyber Shield for Smart Cities|last=Termanini|first=Rocky|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-68287-9|pages=210\u2013211|lccn=2017053798}}</ref>\n\nAn adversary may try to de-anonymize the user by some means.

It is an implementation of [[onion routing]], which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ [[encryption]] in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure [[perfect forward secrecy]] between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature.<ref name=\"usenix-design\" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade [[Internet censorship]] that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name=\"torproject-bridges\" />\n\nBecause the [[IP address]] of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in [[cleartext]] at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor [[Node (networking)|node]] (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n===Originating traffic===\n[[File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay [[Node (networking)|nodes]] from the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[packet sniffing]] program [[EtherApe]]]]\nA Tor user's [[SOCKS]]-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9150 at [[localhost]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2018-12&post=TorPCAP---Tor-Network-Forensics |title= TorPCAP - Tor Network Forensics |website= Netresec |accessdate= 12 December 2018}}</ref> Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the [[cleartext]] packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\n[[File:Tor-non-exit-relay-bandwidth-usage.jpg|thumb|A Tor non-exit relay with a maximum output of 239.69 kbit/s]]\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[instant messaging]], and [[World Wide Web]] browsing.\n\n===Onion services{{anchor|Hidden services}}===\n{{See also|List of Tor onion services}}\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called '''onion services''' (formerly, '''hidden services''').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref> Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its [[.onion|onion address]], usually via the [[#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding [[public key]]s and ''introduction points'' from a [[distributed hash table]] within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[network address translator]]s (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.<ref name=\"torproject-conf-hidden\" />\n\nOnion services were first specified in 2003<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name=\"or-locating\" /> Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors,<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses.\n\nBecause onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /><ref name=\"register-embassy-passwd\" /> The [[open-source software|open source]] OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher [[Sarah Jamie Lewis]], comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"OnionScan\">{{Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7bg3/onionscan-checks-if-your-dark-web-site-really-is-anonymous |title=A Tool to Check If Your Dark Web Site Really Is Anonymous: 'OnionScan' will probe dark web sites for security weaknesses\n |last=Cox |first=Joseph |date=6 April 2016 |website=Motherboard |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> (Lewis has also pioneered the field of onion dildonics, inasmuch as [[sex toy]]s can be insecurely connected over the Internet.)<ref name=\"Onion Dildonics\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=keep getting hacked \u2013 but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

While Tor does provide protection against [[traffic analysis]], it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name=\"torproject-one-cell\" /><ref name=\"torproject-fail-both-ends\" />\n\nIn spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed Tor and the alternative network system [[Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym]] (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other [[tunneling protocol]]s.\n\nThe reason for this is conventional single-hop [[VPN]] protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying [[HTTP]] packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like [[OpenSSH]] and [[OpenVPN]] required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name=\"ccsw-attacking\" />\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.<ref name=\"twe-zmap\"/>\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n\n==== Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ====\nIf an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.<ref name=\"LASTor-2012\" />\n\n==== Exit node eavesdropping ====\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name=\"wired-rogue-nodes\" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use [[end-to-end encryption]] such as [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) or [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name=\"sf-tor-hack\" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name=\"smh-hack-of-year\" />\n\n{{quote|\"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\"}}\n\nIn October 2011, a research team from [[ESIEA (university)|ESIEA]] claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name=\"thn-compromised\" /><ref name=\"01-chercheurs\" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and algorithm [[Random seed|seeds]]. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a [[denial-of-service]] attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name=\"torproject-rumors-exaggerated\" />\n\n===Traffic-analysis attack===\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=27 November 2017|arxiv=1711.10079|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335179|title=2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers|pages=258\u2013262|isbn=978-1-5386-1823-3}}</ref> It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Steven Murdoch]] and George Danezis from [[University of Cambridge]] presented an article at the 2005 [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Symposium]] on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n===Tor exit node block===\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit [[Wikipedia]] when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The [[BBC]] blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its [[iPlayer]] service, although relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help \u2013 Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Bad apple attack===\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of [[BitTorrent]] users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of [[distributed hash table]] tracking.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> According to the study:<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\nThe results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name=\"shining-light\" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\n===Some protocols expose IP addresses===\nResearchers from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in [[BitTorrent]] can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of twenty-three days. Researches used three [[attack vector]]s:<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain a client [[IP address]]. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|3}}\n;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between the tracker and peer, typical [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4}}\n;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nWith this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n\n===Sniper attack===\nJansen ''et al''., describes a [[DDoS]] attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name=\"andssy-sniper\" />\n\n===Heartbleed bug===\nThe [[Heartbleed]] [[OpenSSL]] [[Software bug|bug]] disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while [[private key]]s were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name=\"torproject-openssl-cve\" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken offline as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"ml-rejecting\" /><ref name=\"torproject-news-20140416\" /><ref name=\"ars-ranks-cut\" /><ref name=\"tp-blacklisting\" />\n{{anchor |Relay early attack}}<!-- there are links here; please don't move/remove without fixing the links -->\n\n=== Relay early traffic confirmation attack ===\nOn 30 July 2014 the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to deanonymize onion service users and operators.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"On July 4, 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services.\"</ref>\nIn summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to achieve being designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.<ref name=relay-early-attack>{{cite web | ref = harv | last = Dingledine | first = Roger | date = 30 July 2014 | title = Tor security advisory: \"relay early\" traffic confirmation attack | url = https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack | publisher = The Tor Project }}</ref>\n\nThe attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July.<ref name=relay-early-attack /> \nAlthough when the attack began was unclear, the project implied that between February and July, onion service users' and operators' IP addresses might be exposed.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services... users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected...

The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service... Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n\nThe project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n* patched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used...\"</ref>\n* planned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to),<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase 'Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell'\"</ref> along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one... 3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.\"</ref>\n* recommended that onion services might want to change their locations<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n* reminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent deanonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem.\"</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of [[Operation Onymous]], resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of [[Europol]] was secretive about the method used, saying: \"''This is something we want to keep for ourselves.

In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to [[BitTorrent|torrent]] with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torproject.org/|title=The Tor Project &#124; Privacy & Freedom Online|website=torproject.org}}</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>{{cite web|title=Tor: Overview \u2013 Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=31 August 2016}}</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Odds of detection ===\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n{{quotation|\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>}}\n\nTor does not provide protection against [[Timing attack|end-to-end timing attack]]s: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>\n\n=== Levels of security ===\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\n\n# '''Standard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.'''\n#* This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\n# '''Safer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\n#*On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled.

The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name \"The Onion Router\".<ref name=\"onion-router\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.torproject.org/about/why-is-it-called-tor|title=Why is it called Tor?|website=Tor Project &#124; Support|url-status=live|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer [[overlay network]] consisting of more than seven thousand relays<ref name=\"torstatus\" /> to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting [[Computer and network surveillance#Network surveillance|network surveillance]] or [[Traffic analysis#In computer security|traffic analysis]]. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms\".<ref name=\"nyt-navels\" /> Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.\n\nTor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, [[Wikipedia]] blocks attempts by Tor users to edit articles unless special permission is sought.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html|title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=10 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 June 2017|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://archive.is/kGv45|archive-date=25 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Onion routing]] is implemented by [[encryption]] in the [[application layer]] of a [[communication protocol]] stack, nested like the layers of an [[onion]]. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination [[IP address]], multiple times and sends it through a [[virtual circuit]] comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of [[encryption]] to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication was partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through [[Computer and network surveillance|network surveillance]] that relies upon knowing its source and destination.<ref name=\"Termanini2018\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVNPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT210|title=The Nano Age of Digital Immunity Infrastructure Fundamentals and Applications: The Intelligent Cyber Shield for Smart Cities|last=Termanini|first=Rocky|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-68287-9|pages=210\u2013211|lccn=2017053798}}</ref>\n\nAn adversary may try to de-anonymize the user by some means.

It is an implementation of [[onion routing]], which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ [[encryption]] in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure [[perfect forward secrecy]] between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature.<ref name=\"usenix-design\" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade [[Internet censorship]] that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name=\"torproject-bridges\" />\n\nBecause the [[IP address]] of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in [[cleartext]] at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor [[Node (networking)|node]] (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n===Originating traffic===\n[[File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay [[Node (networking)|nodes]] from the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[packet sniffing]] program [[EtherApe]]]]\nA Tor user's [[SOCKS]]-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9150 at [[localhost]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2018-12&post=TorPCAP---Tor-Network-Forensics |title= TorPCAP - Tor Network Forensics |website= Netresec |accessdate= 12 December 2018}}</ref> Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the [[cleartext]] packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\n[[File:Tor-non-exit-relay-bandwidth-usage.jpg|thumb|A Tor non-exit relay with a maximum output of 239.69 kbit/s]]\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[instant messaging]], and [[World Wide Web]] browsing.\n\n===Onion services{{anchor|Hidden services}}===\n{{See also|List of Tor onion services}}\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called '''onion services''' (formerly, '''hidden services''').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Philipp |title=How Do Tor Users Interact With Onion Services? |url=https://nymity.ch/onion-services/pdf/sec18-onion-services.pdf |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref> Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its [[.onion|onion address]], usually via the [[#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding [[public key]]s and ''introduction points'' from a [[distributed hash table]] within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[network address translator]]s (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.<ref name=\"torproject-conf-hidden\" />\n\nOnion services were first specified in 2003<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name=\"or-locating\" /> Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors,<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses.\n\nBecause onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /><ref name=\"register-embassy-passwd\" /> The [[open-source software|open source]] OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher [[Sarah Jamie Lewis]], comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"OnionScan\">{{Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7bg3/onionscan-checks-if-your-dark-web-site-really-is-anonymous |title=A Tool to Check If Your Dark Web Site Really Is Anonymous: 'OnionScan' will probe dark web sites for security weaknesses\n |last=Cox |first=Joseph |date=6 April 2016 |website=Motherboard |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> (Lewis has also pioneered the field of onion dildonics, inasmuch as [[sex toy]]s can be insecurely connected over the Internet.)<ref name=\"Onion Dildonics\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=keep getting hacked \u2013 but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

While Tor does provide protection against [[traffic analysis]], it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name=\"torproject-one-cell\" /><ref name=\"torproject-fail-both-ends\" />\n\nIn spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed Tor and the alternative network system [[Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym]] (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other [[tunneling protocol]]s.\n\nThe reason for this is conventional single-hop [[VPN]] protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying [[HTTP]] packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like [[OpenSSH]] and [[OpenVPN]] required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name=\"ccsw-attacking\" />\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.<ref name=\"twe-zmap\"/>\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n\n==== Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ====\nIf an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.<ref name=\"LASTor-2012\" />\n\n==== Exit node eavesdropping ====\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name=\"wired-rogue-nodes\" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use [[end-to-end encryption]] such as [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) or [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name=\"sf-tor-hack\" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name=\"smh-hack-of-year\" />\n\n{{quote|\"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\"}}\n\nIn October 2011, a research team from [[ESIEA (university)|ESIEA]] claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name=\"thn-compromised\" /><ref name=\"01-chercheurs\" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and algorithm [[Random seed|seeds]]. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a [[denial-of-service]] attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name=\"torproject-rumors-exaggerated\" />\n\n===Traffic-analysis attack===\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=27 November 2017|arxiv=1711.10079|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335179|title=2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers|pages=258\u2013262|isbn=978-1-5386-1823-3}}</ref> It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Steven Murdoch]] and George Danezis from [[University of Cambridge]] presented an article at the 2005 [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Symposium]] on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n===Tor exit node block===\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit [[Wikipedia]] when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The [[BBC]] blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its [[iPlayer]] service, although relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help \u2013 Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Bad apple attack===\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of [[BitTorrent]] users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of [[distributed hash table]] tracking.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> According to the study:<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\nThe results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name=\"shining-light\" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\n===Some protocols expose IP addresses===\nResearchers from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in [[BitTorrent]] can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of twenty-three days. Researches used three [[attack vector]]s:<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain a client [[IP address]]. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|3}}\n;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between the tracker and peer, typical [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4}}\n;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nWith this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n\n===Sniper attack===\nJansen ''et al''., describes a [[DDoS]] attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name=\"andssy-sniper\" />\n\n===Heartbleed bug===\nThe [[Heartbleed]] [[OpenSSL]] [[Software bug|bug]] disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while [[private key]]s were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name=\"torproject-openssl-cve\" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken offline as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"ml-rejecting\" /><ref name=\"torproject-news-20140416\" /><ref name=\"ars-ranks-cut\" /><ref name=\"tp-blacklisting\" />\n{{anchor |Relay early attack}}<!-- there are links here; please don't move/remove without fixing the links -->\n\n=== Relay early traffic confirmation attack ===\nOn 30 July 2014 the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to deanonymize onion service users and operators.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"On July 4, 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services.\"</ref>\nIn summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to achieve being designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.<ref name=relay-early-attack>{{cite web | ref = harv | last = Dingledine | first = Roger | date = 30 July 2014 | title = Tor security advisory: \"relay early\" traffic confirmation attack | url = https://blog.torproject.org/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack | publisher = The Tor Project }}</ref>\n\nThe attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July.<ref name=relay-early-attack /> \nAlthough when the attack began was unclear, the project implied that between February and July, onion service users' and operators' IP addresses might be exposed.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services... users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected...

The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service... Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n\nThe project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n* patched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used...\"</ref>\n* planned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to),<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase 'Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell'\"</ref> along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one... 3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.\"</ref>\n* recommended that onion services might want to change their locations<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.\"</ref>\n* reminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent deanonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.<ref>{{harvp | Dingledine |2014}} \"...but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem.\"</ref>\n\nIn November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of [[Operation Onymous]], resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of [[Europol]] was secretive about the method used, saying: \"''This is something we want to keep for ourselves.

In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to [[BitTorrent|torrent]] with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torproject.org/|title=The Tor Project &#124; Privacy & Freedom Online|website=torproject.org}}</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>{{cite web|title=Tor: Overview \u2013 Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=31 August 2016}}</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Odds of detection ===\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n{{quotation|\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>}}\n\nTor does not provide protection against [[Timing attack|end-to-end timing attack]]s: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>\n\n=== Levels of security ===\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\n\n# '''Standard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.'''\n#* This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\n# '''Safer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\n#*On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.\n#* Some mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.\n#* Audio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\n# '''Safest \u2013 at this security level, these additional changes apply:'''\n#* JavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.\n#* Some fonts, icons, math symbols, and images are disabled.\n#* Audio and video (HTML5 media),
