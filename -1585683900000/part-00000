fourth studio album by Canadian singer [[The Weeknd]]. The album was released by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]] on March 20, 2020. It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'', following the release of the 2018 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''. The album is dedicated to a fan, who passed away shortly before the album's release. The standard edition has no featured artists, and the deluxe edition features remixed tracks, with [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]], along with additional production from [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]], [[Johnny Jewel]], and [[Oneohtrix Point Never|OPN]]. ''After Hours''{{'}} deluxe edition was later updated to include three new bonus tracks.\n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'', with the last film having a cameo appearance by The Weeknd himself. The project has been supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\". One promotional single has been released as well, the album's [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]]. \n\nOn March 19, 2020, a record 1.02 million users pre-added ''After Hours'' to their [[Apple Music]] library. The album received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is the Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album.\n\n==Background and release==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"''Chapter VI'' was coming soon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weeknd-teases-chapter-vi-album-shares-new-artwork-2413493|title=The Weeknd teases 'Chapter VI' album, shares new artwork|website=NME|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=November 27, 2018|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weekend-says-new-album-will-be-less-pop-friendly-no-more-daytime-music-news.69193.html|title=The Weeknd Says New Album Will Be Less Pop-Friendly: \"No More Daytime Music\"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Ch|first=Devin|date=January 13, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077|title=Is The Weeknd's new album finally on its way?|website=NME|last=Skinner|first=Tom|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Then after a five-month period of silence,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-and-fans-are-convinced-chapter-vi-is-coming-news.96171.html|title=The Weeknd Returns To Instagram & Fans Are Convinced \"Chapter VI\" Is Coming|website=HotNewHipHop|last=A.|first=Aron|date=November 20, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095452/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-with-a-loading-message|title=The Weeknd Returns to Instagram With a \"Loading\" Message|publisher=[[E!

Furthermore, this explains the high resorbent capacity of the kidney, which generally maintains magnesium equilibrium until the creatinine clearance falls below 20 ml/min. Thus, an increase in plasma magnesium levels is practically impossible to achieve with diet alone in conditions of perfect renal health. However, the odds of hypermagnesemia can increase by taking mega-doses of magnesium. The pathophysiology of hypermagnesemia related to excess laxative use is different.

Concentrations of magnesium greater than 1.1&nbsp;mmol/L are considered diagnostic.<ref name=EU2010/>\n\n==Treatment==\nPeople with normal [[kidney function]] (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over 60 ml/min) and mild asymptomatic hypermagnesemia require no treatment except the removal of all sources of exogenous magnesium. One must consider that the half-time of elimination of magnesium is approximately 28 hours.\n\nIn more severe cases, close monitoring of the ECG, blood pressure, and neuromuscular function and early treatment are necessary:\n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate or chloride [Dosage: 1 g in 2 to 5 min (repeatable over 5 minutes)]. The rationale is that the actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function become antagonized by calcium. Intravenous normal saline (e.g., at 150 ml/hour)\n\nSevere clinical conditions require increasing renal magnesium excretion through:\n\nIntravenous loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 1 mg/kg), or hemodialysis, when kidney function is impaired, or the patient is symptomatic from severe hypermagnesemia. This approach usually removes magnesium efficiently (up to 50% reduction after a 3- to 4-hour treatment). Dialysis can, however, increase the excretion of calcium by developing hypocalcemia, thus possibly worsening the symptoms and signs of hypermagnesaemia.\n\nThe use of diuretics must be associated with infusions of saline solutions to avoid further electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. The clinician must perform serial measurements of calcium and magnesium. In association with electrolytic correction, it is often necessary to support cardiorespiratory activity. As a consequence, the treatment of this electrolyte disorder can frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\nParticular clinical conditions require a specific approach. For instance, during the management of eclampsia, the magnesium infusion is stopped if urine output drops to less than 80 mL (in 4 hours), deep tendon reflexes are absent, or the respiratory rate is below 12 breaths/minute. A 10% calcium gluconate or chloride solution (10 mL intravenously repeatable over 5 minutes) can serve as an antidote.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nHypermagnesemia is an uncommon electrolyte disorder. It occurs in approximately 10 to 15% of hospitalized patients with renal failure. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that there is a significant prevalence of high levels of serum magnesium in selected healthy populations. For instance the overall prevalence of hypermagnesemia was 3.0%, especially in males in Iran. For instance high magnesium concentrations were typical in people with cardiovascular disease, and 2.3 mg/dL or higher values were associated with worse hospital mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Complications==\nSevere hypermagnesemia (levels greater than 12 mmol/dL) can lead to cardiovascular complications (hypotension, and arrhythmias) and neurological disorder (confusion and lethargy). Higher values of serum magnesium (exceeding 15 mg/dL) can induce cardiorespiratory arrest and coma. <ref name=stats/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 6259\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|E|83|4|e|70}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|275.2}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 3383\n| eMedicine_mult  = {{eMedicine2|emerg|262}} {{eMedicine2|ped|1080}}\n| MeshID          = \n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|E83.41}}\n}}\n\n{{Mineral metabolic pathology}}\n\n[[Category:Electrolyte disturbances]]\n[[Category:Magnesium]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Toxic effects of metals]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Hypermagnesemia\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = Mg-TableImage.svg\n| caption         = [[Magnesium]]\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Endocrinology]]\n| symptoms        = [[Weakness]], [[confusion]], [[respiratory depression|decreased breathing rate]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| complications   = [[Cardiac arrest]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = [[Kidney failure]], [[iatrogenic|treatment induced]], [[tumor lysis syndrome]], [[seizures]], prolonged [[ischemia]]<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Ron2017/>\n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = Blood level > 1.1&nbsp;mmol/L (2.6&nbsp;mg/dL)<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Mer2018/>\n| differential    = Acute kidney failure, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, lithium toxicity, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis<ref name=stats>{{cite journal | authors = Cascella M, Vaqar S. | title = Hypermagnesemia. | journal = Statspearl | date = 2020 | pmid =31747218 }}</ref>\n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = [[Calcium chloride]], [[intravenous normal saline]] with [[furosemide]], [[hemodialysis]]<ref name=EU2010/>\n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = Uncommon<ref name=Mer2018/>\n| deaths          = \n}}\n<!-- Diagnosis and symptoms -->\n'''Hypermagnesemia''' is an [[electrolyte disorder]] in which there is a high level of [[magnesium]] in the blood.<ref name=Mer2018>{{cite web |title=Hypermagnesemia |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hypermagnesemia |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref> Symptoms include [[weakness]], [[confusion]], [[respiratory depression|decreased breathing rate]], and [[hyporeflexia|decreased reflexes]].<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Mer2018/> Complications may include [[low blood pressure]] and [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=EU2010/><ref name=Ed2011/>\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nIt is typically caused by [[kidney failure]] or is [[iatrogenic|treatment induced]] such as from [[antacids]] that contain magnesium.<ref name=EU2010/><ref>{{cite book| first1=Andrea, M.P.| last1=Romani|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel|editor3=Roland K.

One must consider that the half-time of elimination of magnesium is approximately 28 hours.\n\nIn more severe cases, close monitoring of the ECG, blood pressure, and neuromuscular function and early treatment are necessary:\n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate or chloride [Dosage: 1 g in 2 to 5 min (repeatable over 5 minutes)]. The rationale is that the actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function become antagonized by calcium. Intravenous normal saline (e.g., at 150 ml/hour)\n\nSevere clinical conditions require increasing renal magnesium excretion through:\n\nIntravenous loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 1 mg/kg), or hemodialysis, when kidney function is impaired, or the patient is symptomatic from severe hypermagnesemia. This approach usually removes magnesium efficiently (up to 50% reduction after a 3- to 4-hour treatment). Dialysis can, however, increase the excretion of calcium by developing hypocalcemia, thus possibly worsening the symptoms and signs of hypermagnesaemia.\n\nThe use of diuretics must be associated with infusions of saline solutions to avoid further electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. The clinician must perform serial measurements of calcium and magnesium. In association with electrolytic correction, it is often necessary to support cardiorespiratory activity. As a consequence, the treatment of this electrolyte disorder can frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\nParticular clinical conditions require a specific approach. For instance, during the management of eclampsia, the magnesium infusion is stopped if urine output drops to less than 80 mL (in 4 hours), deep tendon reflexes are absent, or the respiratory rate is below 12 breaths/minute. A 10% calcium gluconate or chloride solution (10 mL intravenously repeatable over 5 minutes) can serve as an antidote.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nHypermagnesemia is an uncommon electrolyte disorder. It occurs in approximately 10 to 15% of hospitalized patients with renal failure. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that there is a significant prevalence of high levels of serum magnesium in selected healthy populations. For instance the overall prevalence of hypermagnesemia was 3.0%, especially in males in Iran. For instance high magnesium concentrations were typical in people with cardiovascular disease, and 2.3 mg/dL or higher values were associated with worse hospital mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.<ref name=stats/>\n\n==Complications==\nSevere hypermagnesemia (levels greater than 12 mmol/dL) can lead to cardiovascular complications (hypotension, and arrhythmias) and neurological disorder (confusion and lethargy). Higher values of serum magnesium (exceeding 15 mg/dL) can induce cardiorespiratory arrest and coma. <ref name=stats/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 6259 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|E|83|4|e|70}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|275.2}} \n|  ICDO           = \n|  OMIM           = \n|  MedlinePlus    = \n|  eMedicineSubj  = med \n|  eMedicineTopic = 3383 \n|  eMedicine_mult = {{eMedicine2|emerg|262}} {{eMedicine2|ped|1080}} \n|  MeshID         =\n}}\n\n{{Mineral metabolic pathology}}\n\n[[Category:Electrolyte disturbances]]\n[[Category:Magnesium]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Toxic effects of metals]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagnesemia"}

Sydney's paternal grandmother approves of the hairstyle, but Syd's father Max thinks she is too young for such a hairdo, so he declines to take her to a hairstylist. Sydney defies her father and, with help from her friend Olive, tries to implement her new hairstyle without a stylist, but she accidentally turns her hair multiple colors. Max changes his mind and decides to take Sydney to a hairstylist to get her desired hairdo, and Syd keeps her failed hairdo a secret from him by wearing a wig. At the salon, Sydney's deceit is revealed when the wig comes off, and Max takes her back home before she can get a new hairdo. Meanwhile, flashback scenes set in 1992 show young Max wanting to bleach his hair so he can fit in better with a group of skateboarders called the Dog Boys. However, his mother disapproves.
