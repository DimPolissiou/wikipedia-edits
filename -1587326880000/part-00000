They acted as general civil administrators, implementing official policies and thereby facilitating unification and modernization. In rural areas especially, the police had great authority and were accorded the same mixture of fear and respect as the village head. Their increasing involvement in political affairs was one of the foundations of the authoritarian state in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe centralized police system steadily acquired responsibilities, until it controlled almost all aspects of daily life, including [[Firefighter|fire prevention]] and mediation of labor disputes. The system regulated [[public health]], business, factories, and construction, and it issued permits and licenses. The [[Peace Preservation Law]] of 1925 gave police the authority to arrest people for \"wrong thoughts\". Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu|Tokko]]) were created to regulate the content of motion pictures, political meetings, and election campaigns. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[military police]] ([[Kempeitai]]) and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]], operating under their respective services and the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|justice]] and [[Home Ministry (Japan)|home ministries]] aided the civilian police in limiting proscribed political activity. After the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, military police assumed greater authority, leading to friction with their civilian counterparts. After 1937 police directed business activities for the war effort, mobilized labor, and controlled transportation.\n\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] authorities in [[World War II]] retained the prewar police structure until a new system was implemented and the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] passed the [[1947 Police Law]]. Contrary to Japanese proposals for a strong, centralized force to deal with postwar unrest, the police system was decentralized. About 1,600 independent municipal forces were established in cities, towns, and villages with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and a [[National Rural Police]] was organized by prefecture. Civilian control was to be ensured by placing the police under the jurisdiction of public safety commissions controlled by the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]] in the Office of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The Home Ministry was abolished and replaced by the less powerful [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], and the police were stripped of their responsibility for fire protection, public health, and other administrative duties.\n\nWhen most of the occupation forces were transferred to [[Korean Peninsula|Korea]] in 1950\u201351 with the [[Korean War]], the 75,000 strong [[National Police Reserve]] (predecessor of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]]) was formed outside the [[#Regular police organizations|Regular police organizations]] to back up the ordinary police during civil disturbances. And pressure mounted for a centralized system more compatible with Japanese political preferences. The 1947 Police Law was amended in 1951 to allow the municipal police of smaller communities to merge with the National Rural Police. Most chose this arrangement, and by 1954 only about 400 cities, towns, and villages still had their own police forces. Under the 1954 amended Police Law, a final restructuring created an even more centralized system in which local forces were organized by prefectures under a [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]].\n\nThe revised Police Law of 1954, still in effect in the 1990s, preserves some strong points of the postwar system, particularly measures ensuring civilian control and political neutrality, while allowing for increased centralization. The National Public Safety Commission system has been retained. State responsibility for maintaining public order has been clarified to include coordination of national and local efforts; centralization of police information, communications, and record keeping facilities; and national standards for training, uniforms, pay, rank, and promotion. Rural and municipal forces were abolished and integrated into prefectural forces, which handled basic police matters. Officials and inspectors in various ministries and agencies continue to exercise special police functions assigned to them in the 1947 Police Law.\n\n===Safety===\nAccording to statistics of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], among the 192 member states of the UN, and among the countries reporting statistics of criminal and criminal justice, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Fifth Survey (1990 - 1994)|url=http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|accessdate=2008-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729012918/http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|archivedate=2009-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Sixth Survey (1995 - 1997)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Sixth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Seventh Survey (1998 - 2000)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Seventh-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Eighth Survey (2001 - 2002)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Eighth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Ninth Survey (2003 - 2004)>Values and Rates per 100,000 Total Population Listed by Country|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Ninth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref> \n\nThe [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration rate]] is very low and Japan ranks 209 out of 223 countries.

By the 1880s, the police had developed into a nationwide instrument of government control, providing support for local leaders and enforcing [[public morality]]. They acted as general civil administrators, implementing official policies and thereby facilitating unification and modernization. In rural areas especially, the police had great authority and were accorded the same mixture of fear and respect as the village head. Their increasing involvement in political affairs was one of the foundations of the authoritarian state in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe centralized police system steadily acquired responsibilities, until it controlled almost all aspects of daily life, including [[Firefighter|fire prevention]] and mediation of labor disputes. The system regulated [[public health]], business, factories, and construction, and it issued permits and licenses. The [[Peace Preservation Law]] of 1925 gave police the authority to arrest people for \"wrong thoughts\". Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu|Tokko]]) were created to regulate the content of motion pictures, political meetings, and election campaigns. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[military police]] ([[Kempeitai]]) and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]], operating under their respective services and the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|justice]] and [[Home Ministry (Japan)|home ministries]] aided the civilian police in limiting proscribed political activity. After the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, military police assumed greater authority, leading to friction with their civilian counterparts. After 1937 police directed business activities for the war effort, mobilized labor, and controlled transportation.\n\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] authorities in [[World War II]] retained the prewar police structure until a new system was implemented and the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] passed the [[1947 Police Law]]. Contrary to Japanese proposals for a strong, centralized force to deal with postwar unrest, the police system was decentralized. About 1,600 independent municipal forces were established in cities, towns, and villages with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and a [[National Rural Police]] was organized by prefecture. Civilian control was to be ensured by placing the police under the jurisdiction of public safety commissions controlled by the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]] in the Office of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The Home Ministry was abolished and replaced by the less powerful [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], and the police were stripped of their responsibility for fire protection, public health, and other administrative duties.\n\nWhen most of the occupation forces were transferred to [[Korean Peninsula|Korea]] in 1950\u201351 with the [[Korean War]], the 75,000 strong [[National Police Reserve]] (predecessor of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]]) was formed outside the [[#Regular police organizations|Regular police organizations]] to back up the ordinary police during civil disturbances. And pressure mounted for a centralized system more compatible with Japanese political preferences. The 1947 Police Law was amended in 1951 to allow the municipal police of smaller communities to merge with the National Rural Police. Most chose this arrangement, and by 1954 only about 400 cities, towns, and villages still had their own police forces. Under the 1954 amended Police Law, a final restructuring created an even more centralized system in which local forces were organized by prefectures under a [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]].\n\nThe revised Police Law of 1954, still in effect in the 1990s, preserves some strong points of the postwar system, particularly measures ensuring civilian control and political neutrality, while allowing for increased centralization. The National Public Safety Commission system has been retained. State responsibility for maintaining public order has been clarified to include coordination of national and local efforts; centralization of police information, communications, and record keeping facilities; and national standards for training, uniforms, pay, rank, and promotion. Rural and municipal forces were abolished and integrated into prefectural forces, which handled basic police matters. Officials and inspectors in various ministries and agencies continue to exercise special police functions assigned to them in the 1947 Police Law.\n\n===Safety===\nAccording to statistics of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], among the 192 member states of the UN, and among the countries reporting statistics of criminal and criminal justice, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Fifth Survey (1990 - 1994)|url=http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|accessdate=2008-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729012918/http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|archivedate=2009-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Sixth Survey (1995 - 1997)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Sixth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Seventh Survey (1998 - 2000)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Seventh-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Eighth Survey (2001 - 2002)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Eighth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Ninth Survey (2003 - 2004)>Values and Rates per 100,000 Total Population Listed by Country|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Ninth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref> \n\nThe [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration rate]] is very low and Japan ranks 209 out of 223 countries.

They made little progress at first, because \"[[blackbirding]]\" (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the [[sugar plantation]]s in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|a series of reprisals and massacres]]. The evils of the slave trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in June 1893.<ref>[http://motherearthtravel.com/solomon_islands/history.htm \"History of the Solomon Islands\".] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago, [[North Solomon Islands|an area previously under German jurisdiction]], was transferred to British administration, apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], which remained under German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon Islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance.\n\nMissionaries settled in the Solomons under the protectorate, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.\n\nJournalist [[Joe Melvin]] visited in 1892, as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding. In 1908 the islands were visited by [[Jack London]], who was cruising the Pacific on his boat, the ''Snark''.\n\n===Second World War===\n\nThe Solomon Islands were one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the famous [[VMA-214|VMF-214 \"Black Sheep\" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg \"Pappy\" Boyington]]. \"The Slot\" was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal. Of more than 36,000 Japanese on Guadalcanal, about 26,000 were killed or missing, 9,000 died of disease, and 1,000 were captured.<ref>Elmer Belmont Potter, Roger Fredland, Henry Hitch Adams (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zql2rWh6QAsC&pg=PA310 Sea power: a naval history].

Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons. The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[Japanese Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mylescfoxdd829.net/TulagiBattle.htm|title=The Tulagi Battle|publisher=Mylescfoxdd829.net|date=7 August 1942|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].\n\nThe [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the Japanese expansion.

A new constitution was established in 1970 and elections were held, although the constitution was contested and a new one was created in 1974. In 1973 the first oil price shock occurred, and the increased cost of running a colony became apparent to British administrators.\n\nFollowing the independence of neighbouring [[Papua New Guinea]] from Australia in 1975, the Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence was granted on 7 July 1978. The first Prime Minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]], and Solomon Islands retained the monarchy.\n\nIn September 2012, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess]] of Cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{cite news |last1=English |first1=Rebecca |title=Carnival Kate met by crowd of 70,000 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203983/Kate-Middleton-met-crowd-70-000-William-parade-streets-canoe-float.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:I was present for the Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978.jpg|The Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977\n</gallery>\n\n===Ethnic violence (1998\u20132003)===\nCommonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, Kabutaulaka (2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm |title=Cap \u2013 Anu |publisher=Rspas.anu.edu.au |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.)\n\nIn late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established in response.\n\nThe reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict. In late 1999, the government declared a four-month state of emergency. There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail. Ulufa'alu also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected.\n\nIn the [[2000 Solomon Islands coup d'etat|June 2000 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23\u201321 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.&nbsp;174).\n\nIn October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |title=THE TOWNSVILLE PEACE AGREEMENT |date=15 October 2000 |website=Commerce.gov.sb |accessdate=9 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210034717/http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 }}</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.\n\nNew elections in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast while militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented.\n\nThe prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.\n\nIn July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]].

A deep underlying resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.<ref name=BBC/> Tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister.\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{main|2007 Solomon Islands earthquake|2013 Solomon Islands earthquake}}\nOn 2 April 2007 at 07:39:56 local time ([[UTC+11]]) an earthquake with magnitude 8.1 occurred at hypocenter S8.453 E156.957, 349 kilometres (217 miles) northwest of the island's capital, [[Honiara]] and south-east of the capital of [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]], [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], at a depth of 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;miles).<ref>[http://www.breakinglegalnews.com/entry/Solomon-Islands-earthquake-and-tsunami \"Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami\"], Breaking Legal News \u2013 International, 4 March 2007</ref> More than 44 aftershocks with magnitude 5.0 or greater occurred up until 22:00:00 UTC, Wednesday, 4 April 2007.

As [[Queen of Solomon Islands]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.\n\nParliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html|title=CIA \u2013 The World Factbook \u2013 Solomon Islands|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the [[Cabinet of Solomon Islands|cabinet]]. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.\n\nSolomon Islands governments are characterised by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent [[votes of no confidence]], leading to frequent changes in government leadership and cabinet appointments.\n\nLand ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.\n\nNo military forces are maintained by Solomon Islands although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government took steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, \u2013 [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 \"Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion\"], \u2013 ''Solomon Times'', \u2013 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five ministers to the opposition. It was the first time a prime minister had lost office in this way in Solomon Islands. On 20 December, Parliament elected the opposition's candidate (and former Minister for Education) [[Derek Sikua]] as Prime Minister, in a vote of 32 to 15.<ref>Tuhaika, Nina., \u2013 [http://www.solomontimes.com:80/news.aspx?nwID=1130 \"New Prime Minister for Solomon Islands\"], \u2013 ''Solomon Times'', \u2013 20 December 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s2123875.htm \"Solomon Islands parliament elects new PM\"], \u2013 [[ABC Radio Australia]], \u2013 20 December 2007</ref>\n\n===Judiciary===\n{{main| Judiciary of Solomon Islands}}\nThe Governor General appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.

The various paramilitary elements of the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] ([[RAMSI]]). RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two [[Pacific class patrol boat]]s (RSIPV ''Auki'' and RSIPV ''Lata''), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.\n\nIn the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security & Correctional Services.\n\nThe police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomon dollars ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat ''Lata'' to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Provinces of Solomon Islands}}\n\nFor local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! # || Province !!

(10702263414).jpg|thumb|[[Malaita]] island]]\n\nSolomon Islands is an island nation that lies east of Papua New Guinea and consists of many islands: [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], the [[Shortland Islands]]; the [[New Georgia Islands]]; [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]; the [[Russell Islands]]; [[Nggela]] (the [[Florida Islands]]); [[Malaita]]; [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]]; [[Sikaiana]]; [[Maramasike]]; [[Ulawa]]; [[Uki Island|Uki]]; [[Makira]] ([[San Cristobal (Solomon Islands)|San Cristobal]]); [[Santa Ana (Solomon Islands)|Santa Ana]]; [[Rennell and Bellona]]; the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] and the remote, tiny outliers, [[Tikopia]], [[Anuta]], and [[Fatutaka]].\n\nThe country's islands lie between latitudes [[5th parallel south|5\u00b0]] and [[13th parallel south|13\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[155th meridian east|155\u00b0]] and [[169th meridian east|169\u00b0E]]. The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically part of Papua New Guinea.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of {{convert|26.5|C|F}} and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about {{convert|3050|mm|in}}.\n\n=== Ecology ===\nThe Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape. Mammals are scarce on the islands, with the only terrestrial mammals being bats and small rodents. Birds and reptiles, however, are abundant.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes.

Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine which was closed after the riots in 2006.\n\n'''Fisheries'''\n\nSolomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed.\n\n'''Tourism'''\n\nTourism, particularly diving, could become an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Tourism growth, however, is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations. In 2017 the Solomon Islands were visited by 26,000 tourists making the country one of the least frequently-visited countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keine Lust auf Massentourismus?

Local [[shell money]] is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands, in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in [[Malaita]] and [[Guadalcanal]] but can be bought elsewhere, such as the [[Honiara Central Market]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/currency-as-cultural-craft-shell-money/|title=Currency as Cultural Craft: Shell Money \u2013 The Official Globe Trekker Website|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> The [[barter]] system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.\nThe Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n===Energy===\nA team of renewable energy developers working for the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) and funded by the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]] (REEEP), have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/solomon-islands-solar-a-new-microfinance-concept-takes-root Solomon Islands Solar: A New Microfinance Concept Takes Root].

For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a 'form of discipline,' suggesting that women could improve the situation by '[learning] to obey [them].'\"\n\nAnother manifestation and driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of [[Bride price#Solomon Islands|bride price]]. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to \"control\" their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men.

They made little progress at first, because \"[[blackbirding]]\" (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the [[sugar plantation]]s in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|a series of reprisals and massacres]]. The evils of the slave trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in June 1893.<ref>[http://motherearthtravel.com/solomon_islands/history.htm \"History of the Solomon Islands\".] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago, [[North Solomon Islands|an area previously under German jurisdiction]], was transferred to British administration, apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], which remained under German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon Islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance.\n\nMissionaries settled in the Solomons under the protectorate, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.\n\nJournalist [[Joe Melvin]] visited in 1892, as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding. In 1908 the islands were visited by [[Jack London]], who was cruising the Pacific on his boat, the ''Snark''.\n\n===Second World War===\n\nThe Solomon Islands were one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the famous [[VMA-214|VMF-214 \"Black Sheep\" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg \"Pappy\" Boyington]]. \"The Slot\" was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal.

A new constitution was established in 1970 and elections were held, although the constitution was contested and a new one was created in 1974. In 1973 the first oil price shock occurred, and the increased cost of running a colony became apparent to British administrators.\n\nFollowing the independence of neighbouring [[Papua New Guinea]] from Australia in 1975, the Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence was granted on 7 July 1978. The first Prime Minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]], and Solomon Islands retained the monarchy.\n\nIn September 2012, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess]] of Cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{cite news |last1=English |first1=Rebecca |title=Carnival Kate met by crowd of 70,000 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203983/Kate-Middleton-met-crowd-70-000-William-parade-streets-canoe-float.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:I was present for the Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978.jpg|The Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977\n</gallery>\n\n===Ethnic violence (1998\u20132003)===\nCommonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, Kabutaulaka (2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm |title=Cap \u2013 Anu |publisher=Rspas.anu.edu.au |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.)\n\nIn late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established in response.\n\nThe reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict. In late 1999, the government declared a four-month state of emergency. There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail. Ulufa'alu also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected.\n\nIn the [[2000 Solomon Islands coup d'etat|June 2000 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23\u201321 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.&nbsp;174).\n\nIn October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |title=THE TOWNSVILLE PEACE AGREEMENT |date=15 October 2000 |website=Commerce.gov.sb |accessdate=9 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210034717/http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 }}</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.\n\nNew elections in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast while militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented.\n\nThe prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.\n\nIn July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]]. Since this time some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110092412/http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2003|title=Pacific Islands: PINA and Pacific|date=10 November 2003}}</ref> However, other academics argue that rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence.<ref>Pillars and Shadows: Statebuilding as Peacebuilding in Solomon Islands, J.

A deep underlying resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.<ref name=BBC/> Tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister.\n\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{main|2007 Solomon Islands earthquake|2013 Solomon Islands earthquake}}\nOn 2 April 2007 at 07:39:56 local time ([[UTC+11]]) an earthquake with magnitude 8.1 occurred at hypocenter S8.453 E156.957, 349 kilometres (217 miles) northwest of the island's capital, [[Honiara]] and south-east of the capital of [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]], [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], at a depth of 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;miles).<ref>[http://www.breakinglegalnews.com/entry/Solomon-Islands-earthquake-and-tsunami \"Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami\"], Breaking Legal News \u2013 International, 4 March 2007</ref> More than 44 aftershocks with magnitude 5.0 or greater occurred up until 22:00:00 UTC, Wednesday, 4 April 2007.

As [[Queen of Solomon Islands]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.\n\nParliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html|title=CIA \u2013 The World Factbook \u2013 Solomon Islands|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the [[Cabinet_of_Solomon_Islands|cabinet]]. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.\n\nSolomon Islands governments are characterised by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent [[votes of no confidence]], leading to frequent changes in government leadership and cabinet appointments.\n\nLand ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.\n\nNo military forces are maintained by Solomon Islands although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government took steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, \u2013 [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 \"Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion\"], \u2013 ''Solomon Times'', \u2013 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five ministers to the opposition. It was the first time a prime minister had lost office in this way in Solomon Islands.

The various paramilitary elements of the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] ([[RAMSI]]). RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two [[Pacific class patrol boat]]s (RSIPV ''Auki'' and RSIPV ''Lata''), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.\n\nIn the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security & Correctional Services.\n\nThe police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomon dollars ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat ''Lata'' to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Provinces of Solomon Islands}}\n\nFor local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! # || Province !!

The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically part of Papua New Guinea.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of {{convert|26.5|C|F}} and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about {{convert|3050|mm|in}}.\n\n=== Ecology ===\nThe Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape. Mammals are scarce on the islands, with the only terrestrial mammals being bats and small rodents. Birds and reptiles, however, are abundant.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes.

Minerals exploration in other areas continued.The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, [[zinc]], nickel, and gold. Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine which was closed after the riots in 2006.\n\n'''Fisheries'''\n\nSolomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed.\n\n'''Tourism'''\n\nTourism, particularly diving, could become an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Tourism growth, however, is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations. In 2017 the Solomon Islands were visited by 26,000 tourists making the country one of the least frequently-visited countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keine Lust auf Massentourismus?

Its symbol is \"SI$\", but the \"SI\" prefix may be omitted if there is no confusion with other currencies also using the [[dollar sign]] \"$\". It is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (currency)|cents]]. Local [[shell money]] is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands, in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in [[Malaita]] and [[Guadalcanal]] but can be bought elsewhere, such as the [[Honiara Central Market]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/currency-as-cultural-craft-shell-money/|title=Currency as Cultural Craft: Shell Money \u2013 The Official Globe Trekker Website|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> The [[barter]] system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.\nThe Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n===Energy===\nA team of renewable energy developers working for the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) and funded by the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]] (REEEP), have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/solomon-islands-solar-a-new-microfinance-concept-takes-root Solomon Islands Solar: A New Microfinance Concept Takes Root].

For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a 'form of discipline,' suggesting that women could improve the situation by '[learning] to obey [them].'\"\n\nAnother manifestation and driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of [[Bride price#Solomon Islands|bride price]]. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to \"control\" their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men.

{"title_page": "Caribbean Festival of Arts", "text_new": "'''Caribbean Festival of Arts''', commonly known as '''CARIFESTA''', is an international multicultural event organized on a periodic basis by the countries of the [[Caribbean]].  The main purpose is to gather artists, musicians, authors, and to exhibit the folkloric and artistic manifestations of the Caribbean and [[Latin America]]n region.\n\n==History==\nThe first Caribbean Festival of Arts took place in 1972. This event was organized by Guyana's then President [[Forbes Burnham]], based on a similar event that took place in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952. He held a number of conferences with Caribbean artists and writers that eventually led to the first Carifesta.\n\nCARIFESTA was conceived out of an appeal from a regional gathering of artists who were at the time participating in a Writers and Artists Convention in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana, in 1970 and which coincided with Guyana\u2019s move to [[Republic]]an status.\n\nThe three main considerations with regard to the festival were:\n* The Festival should be inspirational and should provide artists with the opportunity to discuss among themselves techniques and motivations\n* It should be educational in that the people of the Caribbean would be exposed to the values emerging from the various art forms and it should relate to people and be entertaining on a scale and in a fashion that would commend itself to the Caribbean people\n* The regional creative festival was first held in Georgetown, Guyana in 1972, attracting creative artistes from over 30 Caribbean and Latin American countries.\n\nIt is a celebration of the ethnic and racial diversity which separately and collectively created cultural expressions that are wonderfully unique to the Caribbean.\n\nThe cultural village life of CARIFESTA is intended to be a mixture of the States of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM); the wider Caribbean, Latin America; and a representation of Africa, Asia, Europe and North America\nIt is a vision of the peoples with roots deep in Asia, Europe and Africa, coming together to perform their art forms and embracing literature inspired by the Caribbean\u2019s own peculiar temperament; paintings drawn from the awe inspiring tropical ecology; and the visionary inheritance of our forefathers\n\n==Aims==\nAccording to the CARICOM Organisation, CARIFESTA aims<ref>[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community_organs/carifesta_background.jsp?menu=cob Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428031922/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community_organs/carifesta_background.jsp?menu=cob |date=April 28, 2012 }}</ref> to:\n* depict the life of the people of the region - their heroes, morale, myth, traditions, beliefs, creativeness, ways of expression.\n* show the similarities and the differences of the people of the Caribbean and Latin America \n* create a climate in which art can flourish so that artists would be encouraged to return to their homeland.\n* awaken a regional identity in Literature.\n* stimulate and unite the cultural movement throughout the region.\n\nDescribed as something of an artistic and cultural \"Olympics\" observed by both regional and international states, the festival includes both a cultural opening and closing ceremony with many diverse events in between, including:\n\n'''Drama''' - ranging from elaborate musical productions to comedy, fantasy, ritual, history, folk plays and legend.\n\n'''Music''' - concerts, recitals and musical shows provide tantalising folk rhythms, soul-searching jazz, as well as pop, classics and ballet. There are Indian tablas, African drums, Caribbean [[steel pan]], piano, violin, flute and guitar - in other words, music for every taste.\n\n'''Visual Art''' - exhibitions of sculpture, graphics, paintings, drawings, and photographs are a visual testimony of each country's art forms.\n\n'''Literature''' - an anthology of new writing from the Caribbean region is produced for CARIFESTA, and authors often launch their works at the festivals. There are also poetry recitals and lecture discussions at universities and Conference centres.\n\n'''Folklore''' - groups from over a dozen countries reveal the colour and the mystery of Caribbean and Latin American folklore and legend, among them the Conjunto Folklorico Nacionale of [[Cuba]], the Ol'Higue and Baccos of Guyana, [[Shango]] dancers from [[Trinidad]], Shac Shac musicians from [[Dominica]].\n\n'''Crafts''' - among the unusual events at CARIFESTA will be live demonstrations of ceramics, wood carving, painting and drawing.\n\n'''Dance''' - this part of the programme is all-embracing and covers courtly Javanese dancing, intricate ballet, earthy folk plays, dramatic modern choreography, classical Indian movements, spontaneous improvisations and pop.\n\n'''Heritage Exhibitions''' - host countries such as Guyana and Suriname that boast diverse heritage showcase cultural exhibits and anthropological studies of the [[Amerindians|indigenous people]].\n\n'''Family Life''' - CARIFESTA usually includes \"Kid Zones\" and family workshops to educate and entertain families.\n\n==Regional hosts==\nThe last host of the festival was [[Barbados]] in 2017. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] has taken up the challenge of hosting the event in 2019 from August 16th to 25th for the fourth time under the theme \"Connect, Share Invest\".<ref>[http://www.carifesta.net]</ref>.  Twenty four countries have registered to visit Trinidad and Tobago thus far including non-CARICOM countries such as Curacao, Colombia and Guadeloupe. The hub of CARIFESTA XIV will be the Streets of the Caribbean Grand Market located in the famed Queen's Park Savannah. In addition, over 100 events will be spread across both islands in different genres.\n\nCarifesta now falls under a regional initiative to develop cultural events. In 2008 a task force was set up \"...to develop a comprehensive Regional Development Strategy and Action Plan for the Cultural Industries in CARICOM. This Task Force was also to make recommendations for an appropriate incentives regime and financing mechanism for the cultural industries, among other developmental areas to be addressed.\"\nDr Hilary Brown, CARICOM Secretariat\u2019s Programme Manager for Culture and Community Development, made this announcement at the 21st Meeting of the Regional Cultural Committee (RCC), which opened at the Courtyard Marriott in Paramaribo, Suriname, on Thursday, December 1. She explained that the RCC would discuss with Suriname, plans for CARIFESTA XI, starting with logistic and promotional arrangements.\n\u201cThe Caribbean Community welcomes the offer of the Government of Suriname to host CARIFESTA XI in 2013 and we are all looking forward to the event with great anticipation, she stated,\u201d noting that CARICOM was at a \u201ccrossroads in the development of this highly valued regional expose\u2019 of Caribbean arts and culture.\u201d\n\nIt will be the first time the Dutch-speaking CARICOM country will host the event under the new model prescribed in the strategic plan developed in 2004. The new approach provides more opportunities for professional and artistic development for the region\u2019s artists. The plan proposes that CARIFESTA is geared toward inclusion and creating legacy.\n\nApart from the 15-member CARICOM grouping, the event plans to attract countries of the [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR), of which Suriname has recently become a full member. President [[D\u00e9si Bouterse]] was adamant that in the spirit of globalisation more than 40 Latin American countries would also take part - the highest amount of participating nations in CARIFESTA history. He anticipates that Suriname will host more than 2,000 participants, given the fact that the contingents from each country should number at least 50.\n\nHost city [[Paramaribo]] prepares to welcome painters, sculptors, theatrical artists, musicians, dancers and arts and craftsmen. The festival will be held in the historic wooden inner city of Paramaribo and the organisers [https://archive.is/20130119030328/http://cananewsonline.com/features/83088-cmcfeature-caribbean-culture-suriname%E2%80%99s-wants-largest,-all-inclusive-carifesta-2013.html say] \u201cfrom the Independence Square and the Presidential Palace, down to the heart of town, people are supposed to feel that CARIFESTA is in town. Paramaribo is going to be a Festival City that week\u201d.\n\nSuriname plans to host premier CARIFESTA events such as a [[Curry]]-Duck Fest and a Rum Festival featuring all rums of the region, with bartenders mixing up their cocktails.\n\nIn accordance with the advice given by the CARICOM Secretariat, Suriname has budgeted US$5 million for the event, knowing that the cost could increase. The Management Team are looking to various sponsors including the mobile phone companies operating in Suriname as well as the state oil company [[Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname|Staatsolie]] and gold miner Iamgold to provide much needed funds.\n\nTheatres, exhibition halls, galleries and centres are having infrastructural \"face lifts\" as the country invites the world to the largest Cultural exhibition.\n \nNational carrier [[Surinam Airways]] and Dutch airline [[KLM]] are being approached to provide special rates for participants from [[the Netherlands]] which will open CARIFESTA's arms to Europe.\n\n[[The Bahamas]] has received negative reviews for failing to host the festivals twice. Once in 2008 when Guyana took up the challenge and again in 2010 when they had shown no intentions of hosting it. The future of CARIFESTA seems to be strengthening as Haiti bids to host the event in 2015.\n\nDuring an address at the [[Caribbean Community Heads of Government|33rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community]], hosted in July 2012 in [[Saint Lucia]], Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]] asserted that receiving CARIFESTA in his country would make it possible to increase cultural relations with other neighbouring nations.\n\n \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-----\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA500\" | '''List of CARIFESTA Hostings'''\n|-----\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Carifesta''' || align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Date''' || align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | '''Host''' \n|-----\n|align=left | [[Carifesta I]] || align=center | August 25 - September 15, 1972 || align=right | [[Guyana]] \n|-----\n|align=left | [[Carifesta II]] || align=center | July 23 - August 2, 1976 || align=right | [[Jamaica]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta III]] || align=center  | 1979 || align=right | [[Cuba]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta IV]] ||align=center  | July 19 - August 3, 1981 || align=right | [[Barbados]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta V]] || align=center  | August 22 \u2013 28, 1992 || align=right | [[Trinidad & Tobago]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta VI]] || align=center  | August, 1995 || align=right | [[Trinidad & Tobago]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta VII]] || align=center  | August 17 \u2013 26, 2000 || align=right | [[Saint Kitts & Nevis]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta VIII]] || align=center  | August 25 \u2013 30, 2003 || align=right | [[Suriname]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta IX]] || align=center | September, 2006 || align=right | [[Trinidad & Tobago]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta X]] || align=center  | August 22\u201331, 2008 || align=right | [[Guyana]]\n|----- \n|align=left  | [[Carifesta XI]] || align=center  | Cancelled || align=right | [[The Bahamas]] \n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta XI]] || align=center  | August 16\u201326, 2013 || align=right | [[Suriname]]\n|----- \n|align=left  | [[Carifesta XII]] || align=center  | August 21\u201330, 2015 || align=right | [[Haiti]]\n|-\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta XI]] || align=center  | August 17\u201327, 2017 || align=right | [[Barbados]]\n|-----\n|align=left  | [[Carifesta XIV]] || align=center  | August 16\u201325, 2019 || align=right | [[Trinidad and Tobago]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carifesta.net/ Carifesta] - Official Website\n* Download the festival app at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.manageapps.app_122680]\n\n*[http://dloc.com/?m=hitcarifesta Historical CARIFESTA documents] in the [http://dloc.com/ Digital Library of the Caribbean]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071026112402/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community_organs/carifesta_page.jsp?menu=cob CARIFESTA: The Caribbean Festival of Arts] - [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] Website on Carifesta.\n* [http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/guyana_50002.html Digital UNICEF report from 'Carifesta' in Guyana]\n\n[[Category:Caribbean culture]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Barbados]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Guyana]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Haiti]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Suriname]]\n[[Category:Arts festivals in Trinidad and Tobago]]\n[[Category:Latin American festivals]]\n", "text_old": "'''Caribbean Festival of Arts''', commonly known as '''CARIFESTA''', is an international multicultural event organized on a periodic basis by the countries of the [[Caribbean]].

Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago may have experienced long term decline, but it is the level a few decades previously that is used as the reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked.
