ITC served as a forum for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices for large-scale deployment and operation of telecommunications networks. Since its inception, ITC witnessed the evolution of communications and networking: the influence of computer science on telecommunication, the advent of the Internet and the massive deployment of mobile communications and optics, the appearance of peer-to-peer networking and social networks, the ever increasing speed and flexibility of new communication technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the ever changing operation challenges arising from this development. ITC documented this evolution with contemporary measurement studies, performance analyses of new technologies, recommendations for provisioning and configuration, and greatly contributed to the methodological toolbox of network scientists.\n\nToday, with its conferences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itc-conference.org/congresses.html|title=ITC Congresses|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2016-12-13}}</ref> specialist seminars,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itc-conference.org/specialist-seminars.html|title=ITC Specialist Seminars|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> regional seminars, training courses and publications, the ITC aims at a worldwide forum for all questions related to network and service performance, management, and assessment, both present and futuristic. The notion of traffic is broadly used to encompass data traffic from the MAC layer all the way to application traffic in the application layer. The scope of ITC is thus ranging all issues embedding operations, design, planning, economics and performance analysis of current and emerging communication networks and services, to be addressed by applying a variety of tools from different fields, such as Stochastic Processes, Information theory, Control theory, Signal and Processing, Game theory and optimization techniques, Statistical methodologies and Artificial Intelligence techniques. The target audience of such issues is experts from research organizations, universities, equipment vendors and suppliers, network operators, service providers, system integrators and international technical organizations, guaranteeing a well-balanced contribution from theory, application, and practice. The general goal remains to bring researchers and practitioners together toward operational understanding of all types of current and future networks.\n\nThe ITC is ruled by the [[International Advisory Council]] (IAC) which gathers a number of technical experts, from universities and the research arms of key corporations in the industry, from countries having a strong tradition in teletraffic development. The IAC responsibilities are to disseminate information on teletraffic which is of interest for the whole community and:\n\n*to select the locations of Plenary Congresses and to ensure their high-level technical programme\n*to support Specialist Seminars on specific topics of current interest\n*to promote Regional Seminars for the dissemination of teletraffic concepts in developing countries\n*to facilitate the liaison activity with the ITU through participation in the standardization process and in the Development Programme\n\nThe technical program and the organization of each ITC event remains within the responsibilities of the hosting country, but with significant IAC support to guarantee that the event is consistent with the quality standards established during the previous congresses.\n\nThe ITC Plenary Congresses were scheduled tri-annually from 1955 until 1995 when the interval became bi-annual to account for the ever-accelerating development of network technologies, products and services and the associated dramatic increases in network demands. Similarly, to better cover the impact of dramatic changes undergoing in the field of computer and communication systems, networks and usage, it has been decided to hold the Plenary Congress on an annual basis from 2009.\n\n== Content ==\nTeletraffic science is the traditional term for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices to describe data flows in telecommunication networks, the performance of the usage of network resources, procedures for sizing of resources and engineering the networks for given traffic load and quality of service requirements. For more than 50 years of the 20th century, traffic or teletraffic has been identified primarily with telephone networks. With the huge development of computers, stored program control of network nodes and computer communication, the traditional teletraffic science field naturally extended to computer networks, mobile and wireless/optical networks, and for a wide spectrum of new applications. The convergence between the voice network, the Internet, the television and mobility raised new questions that request new models and tools to be developed. In addition, the development of community networks, home networking, multiple access networking technologies, and the advent of pervasive and ambient communications dictates new challenges to be addressed.\nToday, ITC addresses the emerging paradigms such as an increasing diversity of distributed applications and services over various media like mobile/optical networks, enabling new markets and economy.\n\nITC has steered the evolutions in communications since its creation in 1955 and remains at the forefront of innovation regarding modeling and performance. The scientific roots of communications traffic are based on the theory of probability and stochastic processes, modelling and performance evaluation. Modelling is the key for the mathematical description and quantitative performance analysis. Traffic flows are described by stochastic processes with complex dependencies which have to be validated by traffic measurements. Modelling also includes operational properties of resource control reflected by service strategies such as queueing disciplines, admission control, and routing. The results of such performance analyses are used for resource dimensioning (sizing), resource management, and network optimization while providing targeted Quality of Service. Teletraffic science is closely related to methods of operation research (queueing theory, optimization, forecasting) and computational sciences (simulation technology distributed systems).\n\nIn this context, ITC represents a wide community of researchers and practitioners and is regularly organizing events like Congresses, Specialist Seminars and Workshops in order to discuss the latest changes in the modelling, design and performance of communication systems, networks and services.\n\n=== The evolution of technologies of the 20th century ===\nITC has been witnessing the change of communication and networking technologies which are reflected in the proceedings and programs of the congresses.

{"title_page": "Italian folk music", "text_new": "{{Music of Italy}}\n\n'''Italian folk music''' has a deep and complex history. [[Italian unification|National unification]] came quite late to the [[Italian peninsula]], so its many hundreds of separate cultures remained un-homogenized until quite recently compared to many other European countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  Moreover, Italian folk music reflects Italy's geographic position at the south of [[Europe]] and in the center of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]: [[arab music|Arabic]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[African music|African]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Celtic music|Celtic]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Persian traditional music|Persian]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Slavic]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} influences are readily apparent in the musical styles of the Italian regions. Italy's rough geography and the historic dominance of small [[Italian city-states|city states]] has allowed quite diverse musical styles to coexist in close proximity.\n\nToday, Italy's folk music is often divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system proposed by [[Alan Lomax]] in 1956{{ref|lomax1}} and often repeated since.  The Celtic and Slavic influences on the group and open-voice choral works of the north{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} contrast with the Arabic, Greek, and African influenced strident [[monody]] of the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  In central Italy these influences combine, while indigenous traditions like narrative and ballad singing remain.  The music of the island of [[Sardinia]] is distinct from that of the rest of Italy, and is best known for the polyphonic chanting of the tenores.\n\n==Italian folk revival==\n\n[[File:Italian Folk Musicians in Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Italian folk musicians performing in Edinburgh]]\n\nThe modern understanding of Italian folk music has its roots in the growth of [[ethnomusicology]] in the 1940s and 1950s and in the resurgence of [[Regions of Italy|regionalism]] in Italy at the time.  The [[Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare]] (CNSMP), now part of the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]], was started in 1948 to study and archive the various musical styles throughout Italy.  In the 1950s, a number of important field recordings were conducted by American Alan Lomax and Italians [[Diego Carpitella]], [[Franco Coggiola]], [[Roberto Leydi]] among others. Toward the end of the decade, a special effort was made to capture the folk traditions of the [[Meridione]] (southern Italy), including an important study by Carpitella and anthropologist [[Ernesto de Martino]] of the [[tarantella]].\n\nThe early 1960s saw the rise of social and political popular music, including a vast number of releases by the [[I Dischi del Sole]] label. Several important groups had their birth around the same time, including [[Cantacronache]] in 1958 and the [[Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano]] (NCI) in 1962. The NCI was an assemblage of musicians and composers including [[Giovanna Marini]] that made its first major public appearance at the 1964 [[Spoleto]] Festival dei Due Mondi and generated a large number of records and concerts.\n\nThe Italian [[folk revival]] was accelerating by 1966, when the [[Istituto Ernesto de Martino]] was founded by [[Gianni Bosio]] in [[Milan]] to document Italian oral culture and traditional music. With the emergence of the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]] in 1970, the notion of a musical group organized to promote the music of a particular region (in this case, [[Campania]]) was clearly gaining momentum.  Many of the best known Italian folk revival bands got their start in the following decade, including [[La Lionetta]] (1977), [[Tre Martelli]] (1977), [[La Ciapa Rusa]] (1978), [[Re Niliu]] (1979), [[Calicanto]] (1981), and [[Baraban]] (1983).\n\n==Northern & central Italy==\n\nThe northern regions of Italy historically exhibited Celtic and Slavic influences in their cultures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Roots revival]]ists have revived traditional songs, though, from [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] ([[La Ciapa Rusa]], [[Tre Martelli]]), [[Lombardy]] ([[Barab\u00e0n]], [[Pandemonio]]) and [[Veneto]] ([[Calicanto]]).\n\nThe [[Genoa|Genoese]] docks are the home of [[trallalero]], a polyphonic vocal style with five voices, one of which imitates a guitar.  It arose in the 1920s and includes modern groups like [[La Squadra -- Compagnia del Trallalero]] and [[Laura Parodi]].\n\nThe highly urban provinces of northern and central Italy are also known for the medieval sung poetry [[ottava rima]], especially in [[Tuscany]], [[Lazio]] and [[Abruzzo]].  Ottava rima is performed by the ''poeti contadini'' (''peasant poets'') who use the poems of [[Homer]] or [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], as well as more modern lyrics which address political or social issues.  It is often completely improvised, and sometimes competitive in nature.  Tuscan folk poetry is closer in form and style to high-culture poetry than is typical elsewhere in Italy.\n\nThe [[saltarello]] dance is also popular throughout the region. [[Canzoniere del Lazio]] is one of the biggest names from central Italy during the 1970s [[roots revival]].  With socially aware lyrics, this new wave of Italian roots revivalists often played entirely acoustic songs with influences from [[jazz]] and others.  More modern musicians in the same field include [[Lucilla Galeazzi]], [[La Piazza]] and [[La Macina]].\n\n==Southern Italy==\n[[File:Tarantella caulonia.ogv|thumb|right|Calabrian tarantella at Caulonia (August 2010)]]\n[[File:Domenico Corrado alla pipita.ogv|thumb|Zampogna e ciaramedda]]\nA folk dance called the [[tarantella]] is still sometimes performed.  It was performed to cure the bite of ''[[Lycosa tarentula]]'', usually with female victims dancing until exhaustion. Performers used varying rhythms according to the exact kind of spider.\n\n[[Antonio Infantino (musician)|Antonio Infantino]] has explored the percussion-based tarantolati healing rituals since 1975, when he formed the group [[Tarantolati di Tricarico]].\n\nPuglia is also home to brass bands like [[Banda Citt\u00e1 Ruvo Di Puglia]]; this tradition has led to collaborations with jazz musicians like [[Matteo Salvatore]], [[Battista Lena]], [[Eugenio Colombo]], [[Natale Galletta]] and [[Enrico Rava]].\n\nAnother culturally unique musical tradition in Southern Italy is the [[zampogna]], a form of bagpipe originally played by the shepherd class and is still prevalent in the mountainous regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. The Zampogna, in addition to secular use is associated with the annunciation of Christ and it is still not uncommon to see a zampogna player at a nativity scene during the Christmas season.  The zampogna is most likely a direct descendant of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[aulos]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} and more similar Roman tibia utricularis.\n\n===Ethnic Greeks===\n\nThe ethnic Greeks living in [[Salento]] (Puglia) and Calabria have their own distinct dialects (Griko and Grecanico, respectively).  They have lived in the area for an undetermined amount of time, possibly as early as [[Ancient Greece]] or as late as the [[Middle Ages]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  The community has been largely assimilated by the Italian nation, but there remain speakers of the dialects and other aspects of the culture.  There was a [[roots revival]] in the 1970s in this area, paralleling similar developments across continental Europe, including Brittany and Catalonia.\n\nFolk musical traditions in the area include a religious piece, ''Passiuna tu Christ\u00f9'', which recounts the [[Passion of Christ]].  The Passion is performed by street accordionists with two singers. An example of a [[pizzica]] song from [[Salento]] region is [[Kali Nifta]] (Good night). The lyrics were written in Griko by [[Vito Domenico Palumbo]] (1856\u20131918).\n\n===Sicily===\n{{main|Music of Sicily}}\n\nSicily is home to a great variety of [[religious music]], including [[a cappella]] devotional songs from [[Montedoro]] and many [[brass band]]s like [[Banda Ionica]], who play songs from a diverse repertoire. [[Harvest]] songs and [[work song]]s are also indigenous to the [[agriculture|agricultural]] island, known as \"Italy's granary\". [[Franco Battiato]], [[Fratelli Mancuso]], [[:scn:Luciano Maio|Luciano Maio]], [[:scn:Taberna Mylaensis|Taberna Mylaensis]] and [[Ciccio Busacca]] are among the most popular musicians from Sicily.  Busacca has worked with Dario Fo, like many Italian musicians, but is perhaps best known for his setting the poems of [[Ignazio Buttitta]], a Sicilian [[List of Italian language poets|language poet]].\n\n[[Fratelli Mancuso]] (brothers Enzo and Lorenzo Mancuso) have fused traditional Sicilian peasant songs (''lamintazioni''), monodic chants (''a la carrittera'') and other indigenous forms to create a uniquely Sicilian modern song style.\n\n==Sardinia==\n{{main|Music of Sardinia}}\n\nProbably the most culturally distinct of all the regions in Italy, Sardinia is a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island known for the [[cantu a tenore]] [[polyphony|polyphonic]] chant, sacred songs called [[gozo]]s, and [[launeddas]], a [[woodwind]] instrument similar to the Greek [[aulos]].  Launeddas are used to play a complex style of music that has achieved some international attention, especially [[Dionigi Burranca]], [[Antonio Lara (musician)|Antonio Lara]], [[Luigi Lai]] and [[Efisio Melis]]; Burranca, like many of the most famous launedda musicians, is from [[Samatzai]] in [[Cagliari]].  An ancient instrument, dating back to at least the 8th century BC, launeddas are still played during religious ceremonies and dances (''su ballu'').

[[Italian unification|National unification]] came quite late to the [[Italian peninsula]], so its many hundreds of separate cultures remained un-homogenized until quite recently compared to many other European countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  Moreover, Italian folk music reflects Italy's geographic position at the south of [[Europe]] and in the center of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]: [[arab music|Arabic]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[African music|African]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Celtic music|Celtic]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Persian traditional music|Persian]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Slavic]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} influences are readily apparent in the musical styles of the Italian regions. Italy's rough geography and the historic dominance of small [[Italian city-states|city states]] has allowed quite diverse musical styles to coexist in close proximity.\n\nToday, Italy's folk music is often divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system proposed by [[Alan Lomax]] in 1956{{ref|lomax1}} and often repeated since.  The Celtic and Slavic influences on the group and open-voice choral works of the north{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} contrast with the Arabic, Greek, and African influenced strident [[monody]] of the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  In central Italy these influences combine, while indigenous traditions like narrative and ballad singing remain.  The music of the island of [[Sardinia]] is distinct from that of the rest of Italy, and is best known for the polyphonic chanting of the tenores.\n\n==Italian folk revival==\n\n[[File:Italian Folk Musicians in Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Italian folk musicians performing in Edinburgh]]\n\nThe modern understanding of Italian folk music has its roots in the growth of [[ethnomusicology]] in the 1940s and 1950s and in the resurgence of [[Regions of Italy|regionalism]] in Italy at the time.  The [[Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare]] (CNSMP), now part of the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]], was started in 1948 to study and archive the various musical styles throughout Italy.  In the 1950s, a number of important field recordings were conducted by American Alan Lomax and Italians [[Diego Carpitella]], [[Franco Coggiola]], [[Roberto Leydi]] among others. Toward the end of the decade, a special effort was made to capture the folk traditions of the [[Meridione]] (southern Italy), including an important study by Carpitella and anthropologist [[Ernesto de Martino]] of the [[tarantella]].\n\nThe early 1960s saw the rise of social and political popular music, including a vast number of releases by the [[I Dischi del Sole]] label. Several important groups had their birth around the same time, including [[Cantacronache]] in 1958 and the [[Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano]] (NCI) in 1962. The NCI was an assemblage of musicians and composers including [[Giovanna Marini]] that made its first major public appearance at the 1964 [[Spoleto]] Festival dei Due Mondi and generated a large number of records and concerts.\n\nThe Italian [[folk revival]] was accelerating by 1966, when the [[Istituto Ernesto de Martino]] was founded by [[Gianni Bosio]] in [[Milan]] to document Italian oral culture and traditional music. With the emergence of the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]] in 1970, the notion of a musical group organized to promote the music of a particular region (in this case, [[Campania]]) was clearly gaining momentum.  Many of the best known Italian folk revival bands got their start in the following decade, including [[La Lionetta]] (1977), [[Tre Martelli]] (1977), [[La Ciapa Rusa]] (1978), [[Re Niliu]] (1979), [[Calicanto]] (1981), and [[Baraban]] (1983).\n\n==Northern & central Italy==\n\nThe northern regions of Italy historically exhibited Celtic and Slavic influences in their cultures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Roots revival]]ists have revived traditional songs, though, from [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] ([[La Ciapa Rusa]], [[Tre Martelli]]), [[Lombardy]] ([[Barab\u00e0n]], [[Pandemonio]]) and [[Veneto]] ([[Calicanto]]).\n\nThe [[Genoa|Genoese]] docks are the home of [[trallalero]], a polyphonic vocal style with five voices, one of which imitates a guitar.  It arose in the 1920s and includes modern groups like [[La Squadra -- Compagnia del Trallalero]] and [[Laura Parodi]].\n\nThe highly urban provinces of northern and central Italy are also known for the medieval sung poetry [[ottava rima]], especially in [[Tuscany]], [[Lazio]] and [[Abruzzo]].  Ottava rima is performed by the ''poeti contadini'' (''peasant poets'') who use the poems of [[Homer]] or [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], as well as more modern lyrics which address political or social issues.  It is often completely improvised, and sometimes competitive in nature.  Tuscan folk poetry is closer in form and style to high-culture poetry than is typical elsewhere in Italy.\n\nThe [[saltarello]] dance is also popular throughout the region. [[Canzoniere del Lazio]] is one of the biggest names from central Italy during the 1970s [[roots revival]].  With socially aware lyrics, this new wave of Italian roots revivalists often played entirely acoustic songs with influences from [[jazz]] and others.  More modern musicians in the same field include [[Lucilla Galeazzi]], [[La Piazza]] and [[La Macina]].\n\n==Southern Italy==\n[[File:Tarantella caulonia.ogv|thumb|right|Calabrian tarantella at Caulonia (August 2010)]]\n[[File:Domenico Corrado alla pipita.ogv|thumb|Zampogna e ciaramedda]]\nA folk dance called the [[tarantella]] is still sometimes performed.  It was performed to cure the bite of ''[[Lycosa tarentula]]'', usually with female victims dancing until exhaustion. Performers used varying rhythms according to the exact kind of spider.\n\n[[Antonio Infantino (musician)|Antonio Infantino]] has explored the percussion-based tarantolati healing rituals since 1975, when he formed the group [[Tarantolati di Tricarico]].\n\nPuglia is also home to brass bands like [[Banda Citt\u00e1 Ruvo Di Puglia]]; this tradition has led to collaborations with jazz musicians like [[Matteo Salvatore]], [[Battista Lena]], [[Eugenio Colombo]], [[Natale Galletta]] and [[Enrico Rava]].\n\nAnother culturally unique musical tradition in Southern Italy is the [[zampogna]], a form of bagpipe originally played by the shepherd class and is still prevalent in the mountainous regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. The Zampogna, in addition to secular use is associated with the annunciation of Christ and it is still not uncommon to see a zampogna player at a nativity scene during the Christmas season.  The zampogna is most likely a direct descendant of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[aulos]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} and more similar Roman tibia utricularis.\n\n===Ethnic Greeks===\n\nThe ethnic Greeks living in [[Salento]] (Puglia) and Calabria have their own distinct dialects (Griko and Grecanico, respectively).  They have lived in the area for an undetermined amount of time, possibly as early as [[Ancient Greece]] or as late as the [[Middle Ages]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}  The community has been largely assimilated by the Italian nation, but there remain speakers of the dialects and other aspects of the culture.  There was a [[roots revival]] in the 1970s in this area, paralleling similar developments across continental Europe, including Brittany and Catalonia.\n\nFolk musical traditions in the area include a religious piece, ''Passiuna tu Christ\u00f9'', which recounts the [[Passion of Christ]].  The Passion is performed by street accordionists with two singers. An example of a [[pizzica]] song from [[Salento]] region is [[Kali Nifta]] (Good night). The lyrics were written in Griko by [[Vito Domenico Palumbo]] (1856\u20131918).\n\n===Sicily===\n{{main|Music of Sicily}}\n\nSicily is home to a great variety of [[religious music]], including [[a cappella]] devotional songs from [[Montedoro]] and many [[brass band]]s like [[Banda Ionica]], who play songs from a diverse repertoire. [[Harvest]] songs and [[work song]]s are also indigenous to the [[agriculture|agricultural]] island, known as \"Italy's granary\". [[Franco Battiato]], [[Fratelli Mancuso]], [[:scn:Luciano Maio|Luciano Maio]], [[:scn:Taberna Mylaensis|Taberna Mylaensis]] and [[Ciccio Busacca]] are among the most popular musicians from Sicily.  Busacca has worked with Dario Fo, like many Italian musicians, but is perhaps best known for his setting the poems of [[Ignazio Buttitta]], a Sicilian [[List of Italian language poets|language poet]].\n\n[[Fratelli Mancuso]] (brothers Enzo and Lorenzo Mancuso) have fused traditional Sicilian peasant songs (''lamintazioni''), monodic chants (''a la carrittera'') and other indigenous forms to create a uniquely Sicilian modern song style.\n\n==Sardinia==\n{{main|Music of Sardinia}}\n\nProbably the most culturally distinct of all the regions in Italy, Sardinia is a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island known for the [[cantu a tenore]] [[polyphony|polyphonic]] chant, sacred songs called [[gozo]]s, and [[launeddas]], a [[woodwind]] instrument similar to the Greek [[aulos]].  Launeddas are used to play a complex style of music that has achieved some international attention, especially [[Dionigi Burranca]], [[Antonio Lara (musician)|Antonio Lara]], [[Luigi Lai]] and [[Efisio Melis]]; Burranca, like many of the most famous launedda musicians, is from [[Samatzai]] in [[Cagliari]].  An ancient instrument, dating back to at least the 8th century BC, launeddas are still played during religious ceremonies and dances (''su ballu'').  Distinctively, they are played using extensive variations on a few melodic phrases, and a single song can last over an hour.\n\nThe ottava, or eight-line stanza, is a common lyrical form in Sardinia, one which allows the performer a certain amount of improvisation and is not unlike the [[stornello]] of south-central mainland Italy.\n\nRural polyphonic chanting of the tenores is sung with four vocal parts.
