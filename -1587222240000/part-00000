In the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]] regions of Uttarakhand in India, the Khas Brahmins and Khas Rajputs had a lower social status than the other Brahmins and Rajputs. However, in present-day western Nepal, they had the same status as the other Brahmins and Rajputs, possibly as a result of their political power in the Khasa Malla kingdom.{{sfn|John T Hitchcock|1978|pp=116-119}} \n\n[[File:Mandhata Shahi- SAKE-1612.jpg|thumb|Copper Inscription by King of [[Doti]], ''Raika'' Mandhata Shahi at [[Saka Era]] 1612 (\u0936\u093e\u0915\u0947 \u0967\u096c\u0967\u0968) (or 1747 [[Bikram Samvat]]) in old [[Khas language]] using [[Devanagari]] script]]\nUntil the 19th century, the [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkhali]] referred to their country as ''Khas Desh'' (Khas country).{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=107}} As they annexed the various neighbouring countries (such as Newar of the [[Newar people]]) to the Gorkha kingdom, the terms such as ''Khas'' and ''Newar'' ceased to be used as the names of countries. The 1854 legal code (''Muluki Ain''), promulgated by the Nepali Prime Minister [[Jung Bahadur Rana]], himself a Khas,{{sfn|Dor Bahadur Bista|1991|p=37}} no longer referred to ''Khas'' as a country, rather as a ''[[j\u0101ti|j\u0101t]]'' (species or community) within the Gorkha kingdom.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=117}}\n\nThe [[Shah dynasty]] of the Gorkha Kingdom, as well as the succeeding [[Rana dynasty]], spoke the [[Khas language]] (now called the Nepali language). However, they claimed to be Rajputs of western Indian origin, rather than the native Khas Kshatriyas.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=119}} Since outside Nepal, the Khas social status was seen as inferior to that of the Rajputs, the rulers started describing themselves as natives of the Hill country, rather than that of the Khas country. Most people, however, considered the terms ''Khas'' and ''Parbatiya'' (''Pahari/Pahadi'' or [[Hill tribes of Northeast India|Hill people]]) as synonymous.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=107}}\n\nJung Bahadur also re-labeled the Khas ''j\u0101t'' as [[Chhetri]] in present-day Nepal.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=119}} Originally, the [[Brahmin]] immigrants from the [[Gangetic plain|plains]] considered the Khas as low-caste because of the latter's neglect of high-caste taboos (such as alcohol abstinence).{{sfn|Susan Thieme|2006|p=83}} The upper-class Khas people commissioned the [[Bahun]] (Brahmin) priests to initiate them into the high-caste Chhetri order and adopted high-caste manners. Other Khas families who could not afford to (or did not care to) pay the Bahun priests also attempted to assume the Chhetri status but were not recognized as such by others. They are now called Matwali (alcohol-drinking) Chhetris.{{sfn|Dor Bahadur Bista|1991|p=48}}\n\nBecause of the adoption of the ''Chhetri'' identity, the term ''Khas'' is rapidly becoming obsolete.{{sfn|William Brook Northey|C.

The Newar people used the term ''Khayan Bhaya'', ''Parbatiya''{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}} and ''Gorkhali'' as a name for this language, as they identified it with the Gorkhali conquerors. The Gorkhalis themselves started using this term to refer to their language at a later stage.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=118}} In an attempt to disassociate himself with his Khas past, the Rana monarch Jung Bahadur decreed that the term Gorkhali be used instead of ''Khas kur\u0101'' to describe the language. Meanwhile, the [[British India]]n administrators had started using the term ''Nepal'' (after Newar) to refer to the Gorkha kingdom. In the 1930s, the Gorkha government also adopted this term to describe their country. Subsequently, the Khas language also came to be known as ''Nepali language''.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|pp=118-119}} It has become a national language of Nepal and [[lingua franca]] among the majority of population of [[North Bengal]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]].{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}}\n\n===Classification===\nHistorian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that the [[Khas language]] belonged to neither the [[Iranian languages]] nor the [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], but to the mid [[Indo-Iranian languages]].{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}}\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Nepal===\nModern-day Khas people are referred to as Khas Brahmin (commonly called as Khas [[Bahun]]), Khas Rajput (commonly called as Khas [[Chhetri]]) and Khas Dalit.{{sfn|John T Hitchcock|1978|pp=116-119}} Khas people are popularly referred in modern times as ''Khas Arya''.\n\n===India===\nIn [[Kumaon District|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]] regions of [[Uttarakhand]] in India, too, the term ''Khas'' has become obsolete. The Khas (or Khasia) people of Kumaon adopted the self-designation Kumaoni Jiagahari Rajput, after being elevated to the Rajput status by the [[Chand kings]].

In the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]] regions of Uttarakhand in India, the Khas Brahmins and Khas Rajputs had a lower social status than the other Brahmins and Rajputs.

The 1854 legal code (''Muluki Ain''), promulgated by the Nepali Prime Minister [[Jung Bahadur Rana]], himself a Khas,{{sfn|Dor Bahadur Bista|1991|p=37}} no longer referred to ''Khas'' as a country, rather as a ''[[j\u0101ti|j\u0101t]]'' (species or community) within the Gorkha kingdom.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=117}}\n\nThe [[Shah dynasty]] of the Gorkha Kingdom, as well as the succeeding [[Rana dynasty]], spoke the [[Khas language]] (now called the Nepali language). However, they claimed to be Rajputs of western Indian origin, rather than the native Khas Kshatriyas.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=119}} Since outside Nepal, the Khas social status was seen as inferior to that of the Rajputs, the rulers started describing themselves as natives of the Hill country, rather than that of the Khas country. Most people, however, considered the terms ''Khas'' and ''Parbatiya'' (''Pahari/Pahadi'' or [[Hill tribes of Northeast India|Hill people]]) as synonymous.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=107}}\n\nJung Bahadur also re-labeled the Khas ''j\u0101t'' as [[Chhetri]] in present-day Nepal.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=119}} Originally, the [[Brahmin]] immigrants from the [[Gangetic plain|plains]] considered the Khas as low-caste because of the latter's neglect of high-caste taboos (such as alcohol abstinence).{{sfn|Susan Thieme|2006|p=83}} The upper-class Khas people commissioned the [[Bahun]] (Brahmin) priests to initiate them into the high-caste Chhetri order and adopted high-caste manners.

They are now called Matwali (alcohol-drinking) Chhetris.{{sfn|Dor Bahadur Bista|1991|p=48}}\n\nBecause of the adoption of the ''Chhetri'' identity, the term ''Khas'' is rapidly becoming obsolete.{{sfn|William Brook Northey|C.

The Newar people used the term ''Khayan Bhaya'', ''Parbatiya''{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}} and ''Gorkhali'' as a name for this language, as they identified it with the Gorkhali conquerors. The Gorkhalis themselves started using this term to refer to their language at a later stage.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=118}} In an attempt to disassociate himself with his Khas past, the Rana monarch Jung Bahadur decreed that the term Gorkhali be used instead of ''Khas kur\u0101'' to describe the language. Meanwhile, the [[British India]]n administrators had started using the term ''Nepal'' (after Newar) to refer to the Gorkha kingdom. In the 1930s, the Gorkha government also adopted this term to describe their country. Subsequently, the Khas language also came to be known as ''Nepali language''.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|pp=118-119}} It has become a national language of Nepal and [[lingua franca]] among the majority of population of [[North Bengal]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]].{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}}\n\n===Classification===\nHistorian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that the [[Khas language]] belonged to neither the [[Iranian languages]] nor the [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], but to the mid [[Indo-Iranian languages]].{{sfn|Pokhrel|1973|p=229}}\n\n==Modern==\n\n===Nepal===\nModern-day Khas people are referred to as Khas Brahmin (commonly called as Khas [[Bahun]]), Khas Rajput (commonly called as Khas [[Chhetri]]) and Khas Dalit.{{sfn|John T Hitchcock|1978|pp=116-119}} Khas people are popularly referred in modern times as ''Khas Arya''.\n\n===India===\nIn [[Kumaon District|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]] regions of [[Uttarakhand]] in India, too, the term ''Khas'' has become obsolete. The Khas (or Khasia) people of Kumaon adopted the self-designation Kumaoni Jiagahari Rajput, after being elevated to the Rajput status by the [[Chand kings]].

The plague brought great economic shifts alongside the human cost. Shropshire [[Inquisition post mortem|inquisitions post mortem]] taken during the plague outbreak show that land lay uncultivated and some landowners struggled to pay even very modest rents,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/inquis-post-mortem/vol11/pp194-206 Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 166, no. 233.]</ref> and some estates were considered worthless.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/inquis-post-mortem/vol11/pp400-414 Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 179, no. 537.]</ref> While the majority of the rural population was placed at an advantage by labour shortages, landlords were forced to relax conditions imposed on tenants and to buy in labour.<ref>Baugh and Elrington (1989), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol4/pp72-118#anchorn196 Domesday Book: 1300\u20131540: Demesne agriculture, note anchor 196-199.]</ref> This is the economic and agrarian background to John Darras's lifelong struggles to consolidate and extend his estates and to find additional sources of income, mainly through business and military service.\n\nJohn Darras's mother, Joan, must also have died in his childhood.

There were also a few other small, scattered holdings, notably a third of the manor of Linley, held of the [[Wenlock Priory|Prior of Wenlock]].<ref name=linley>Currie et al, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol10/pp348-354#h3-0002 Linley \u2013 Manor and other estates.]</ref> This was a small patrimony and Darras fought legal battles, sometimes backed by force, at several points in his life to extend his holdings, although with limited success.\n\nIn 1379,<ref>Page and Willis-Bund: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/worcs/vol4/pp297-317#n193 Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley \u2013 Manors, note anchor 193]</ref> and again in 1383,<ref>Page and Willis-Bund: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/worcs/vol4/pp297-317#fnn196 Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley \u2013 Manors, footnote 196]</ref> Darras and his aunts Burga and Elizabeth contested ownership of the manors of Ribbesford and [[Rock, Worcestershire]], which had been held by Sir Henry Ribbesford, also under the Mortimers of [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]].<ref name=rib/> They were opposed by John de Resunden, the husband of their distant relative, Iseult.

The church was monastic property.]]\nPatronage of the churches on most of these estates, potentially a lucrative right, went to Darras. The [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectory]] of Sidbury was in his gift and he is known to have made presentations to it. On 16 June 1386 Darras authorised an exchange of clergy, by which the local priest went to St Katherine's chapel in [[Hereford Cathedral]] and the former cathedral chaplain, Philip Kentles, became rector of Sidbury.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyyork18unknuoft#page/n143/mode/2up ''Registrum Johannis Gilbert'', p. 125.]</ref> St Katherine's chapel served the Bishop's Palace,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/heref/vol1/pp90-144#h3-0002 ''Hereford: Ecclesiastical'' in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Herefordshire, Volume 1, South west.]</ref> so this exchange must have been of importance to [[John Gilbert (bishop of St David's)|John Gilbert]], presumably earning Darras a modicum of episcopal favour. In April 1392 Darras appointed a successor after Philip's death.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyyork14unknuoft#page/n421/mode/2up ''Registrum Johannis Trefnant'', p. 176.]</ref> At Neenton too Darras held and used the advowson, presenting Roger Murimore as incumbent of the church in November 1399.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyyork14unknuoft#page/n427/mode/2up ''Registrum Johannis Trefnant'', p. 183.]</ref> Linley's church was a chapel of Holy Trinity Church in [[Much Wenlock]],<ref>Currie et al, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol10/pp348-354#h3-0006 Linley \u2013 Church.]</ref> which was in the hands of Wenlock Priory, the feudal overlord, leaving Darras with no control.

On the right are remains of the [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] house. The Corbets of Moreton Corbet were themselves powerful allies but also, like Darras, found further security in the Arundel affinity.]]\nDarras married '''Joan Corbet'''. The marriage took place before 1390. However, as Darras is not recorded as active on Joan's behalf in the Corbet property disputes of 1385, it must have been in the second half of the 1380s. Darras formally entered the Arundel affinity in 1387, which may coincide approximately with his marriage.\n\nJoan Corbet was the daughter of \n:*'''Sir Robert Corbet''' (died 1375) of Moreton Corbet.<ref name=visitation/> The Corbets of Moreton Corbet had taken over as the senior line of Corbets in the region, as the Corbets at [[Caus Castle]] had petered out in 1347.<ref name=landlords/>\n:*'''Elizabeth Le Strange''', daughter of Fulk, 1st [[Baron Strange of Blackmere|Baron Strange]] of [[Blakemere|Blackmere]].<ref name=rog/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/368/mode/2up Corbet, pedigree facing p.368,]</ref> The Le Strange family were another important dynasty of [[Marcher Lords]] with many branches. The Blackmere barony was of fairly recent foundation. Elizabeth's father was called to parliament by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and served him as Seneschal of Gascony,<ref>[http://www.gasconrolls.org/indexes/entity-004770.html Fulk Lestrange at the Gascon Rolls Project (1317\u20131478)], accessed 4 December 2013</ref> the head of the administration of the remaining [[Plantagenet]] possessions in France. The title could be passed through both male and female, and the tortuous line of descent of the Le Stranges may have been one of the factors predisposing the Corbets towards reinforcing [[male primogeniture]] through dubious property transactions. From 1383 it passed via female descent and marriage to the Talbot family,<ref name=landlords/> and was one of the many titles collected together by John Talbot, [[Baron Furnivall]] and later [[Earl of Shrewsbury]].\n\nJoan was the widow of Robert de Harley of Willey and had a daughter and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from her own family and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had a considerable amount of [[jointure]] property from her first marriage \u2013 in Shropshire at [[Harley, Shropshire|Harley]], [[Gretton, Shropshire|Gretton]], Willey and [[Kenley, Shropshire|Kenley]], and in [[Worcestershire]] part of a manor at [[Hampton Lovett]],<ref name=mp/> known as Over Hall.<ref name=hampton>A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 3: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43102#s2 Hampton Lovett \u2013 Manors], cf. footnote 28.</ref> Some of these properties passed to Roger Willey, a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400,<ref name=mp/> presumably on Joan's death: Willey was a business associate of Darras.<ref name=cpr1405-08-271/> The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall.<ref name=hampton/>\n\nJoan was almost certainly some years older than Darras. It is not clear whether they had children, although Darras may have left a son named Roger.<ref name=mp/> Joan seems to have died around the turn of the century, with her properties largely leaving his control, prompting Darras to an active and fairly successful search for further sources of income in the years following.\n\nJoan's family, the Corbets of [[Moreton Corbet Castle]] were one of the rising gentry families, steadily increasing their estates and their influence.<ref name=landlords>Baugh and Elrington (1989), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol4/pp72-118#h3-0002 Domesday Book: 1300\u20131540: Landlords]</ref> However, they were not of the first rank, and both they and Darras were increasingly to seek advancement through the [[affinities|affinity]] of the FitzAlans, the [[Earls of Arundel]], who were supreme both economically and politically in Shropshire as well being among the greatest magnates in England.\n\n==The Corbet property disputes==\n[[File:Richard II King of England.jpg|thumb|Richard II, who intervened in and profited from the Corbet property disputes.]]\nJoan Corbet's brother, [[Roger Corbet (died 1395)|Sir Roger]], was preoccupied with family disputes over property, many of which involved Joan. Darras inevitably took his wife's side, sometimes bringing him into disrepute with the king and his government.\n\nRoger Corbet had two older brothers, Thomas and John, as well as a younger brother, John, and sisters, including Joan, who was possibly the eldest of the siblings.<ref name=visitation>[https://archive.org/stream/visitationshrop00britgoog#page/n188/mode/2up Visitation of Shropshire, p. 134.]</ref> Roger and Joan's parents, Robert and Elizabeth Corbet, had been concerned to keep the family estates together in a time of short life-spans and tortuous succession that affected many landowning families.

Darras served with him in a naval campaign against the French, which culminated in a significant victory off [[Margate]]. As a client of the earl, and in association with two other members of his affinity, [[John Burley]] and Fulk Sprenghose, Darras was made trustee of estates belonging to Richard, 4th Lord Talbot, who was married to Arundel's niece, Ankaret le Strange of Blackmere.<ref name=ls288>[https://archive.org/stream/lestrangerecords00lond#page/288/mode/2up Le Strange, p. 288.]</ref> In 1393 he represented his county in the parliament that began on 20 January and lasted about three weeks.

Darras seems to have good connections with both parts of the victorious coalition and from this point he contrived to remain in royal favour, albeit sometimes with difficulty. He was made keeper for life of [[Morfe Forest|Morfe]] and Shirlet, areas of [[Royal forest]] on either side of the [[Severn]] in Shropshire, by [[letters patent]] of 4 November 1399.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/calendarpatentr16offigoog#page/n75/mode/2up Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399\u20131401, p. 64.]</ref> After his loyal service against the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising]] in Wales, a major preoccupation of both Arundel and the king,  further letters patent in February 1407, described Darras as the \"king's esquire,\" and confirmed that the office was indeed a reward for his military service and permitted him to appoint a ranger as a deputy to act in his absences.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015031079588;view=1up;seq=308 Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405\u20131408, p. 296.]</ref>\n\nIt was probably his connection with the FitzAlans that assured his appointment as [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]] for 1401-2.

The [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectory]] of Sidbury was in his gift and he is known to have made presentations to it. On 16 June 1386 Darras authorised an exchange of clergy, by which the local priest went to St Katherine's chapel in [[Hereford Cathedral]] and the former cathedral chaplain, Philip Kentles, became rector of Sidbury.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyyork18unknuoft#page/n143/mode/2up ''Registrum Johannis Gilbert'', p. 125.]</ref> St Katherine's chapel served the Bishop's Palace,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/heref/vol1/pp90-144#h3-0002 ''Hereford: Ecclesiastical'' in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Herefordshire, Volume 1, South west.]</ref> so this exchange must have been of importance to [[John Gilbert (bishop of St David's)|John Gilbert]], presumably earning Darras a modicum of episcopal favour.

The Corbets of Moreton Corbet were themselves powerful allies but also, like Darras, found further security in the Arundel affinity.]]\nDarras married '''Joan Corbet'''. The marriage took place before 1390. However, as Darras is not recorded as active on Joan's behalf in the Corbet property disputes of 1385, it must have been in the second half of the 1380s. Darras formally entered the Arundel affinity in 1387, which may coincide approximately with his marriage.\n\nJoan Corbet was the daughter of \n:*'''Sir Robert Corbet''' (died 1375) of Moreton Corbet.<ref name=visitation/> The Corbets of Moreton Corbet had taken over as the senior line of Corbets in the region, as the Corbets at [[Caus Castle]] had petered out in 1347.<ref name=landlords/>\n:*'''Elizabeth Le Strange''', daughter of Fulk, 1st [[Baron Strange of Blackmere|Baron Strange]] of [[Blakemere|Blackmere]].<ref name=rog/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/368/mode/2up Corbet, pedigree facing p.368,]</ref> The Le Strange family were another important dynasty of [[Marcher Lords]] with many branches. The Blackmere barony was of fairly recent foundation. Elizabeth's father was called to parliament by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and served him as Seneschal of Gascony,<ref>[http://www.gasconrolls.org/indexes/entity-004770.html Fulk Lestrange at the Gascon Rolls Project (1317\u20131478)], accessed 4 December 2013</ref> the head of the administration of the remaining [[Plantagenet]] possessions in France. The title could be passed through both male and female, and the tortuous line of descent of the Le Stranges may have been one of the factors predisposing the Corbets towards reinforcing [[male primogeniture]] through dubious property transactions. From 1383 it passed via female descent and marriage to the Talbot family,<ref name=landlords/> and was one of the many titles collected together by John Talbot, [[Baron Furnivall]] and later [[Earl of Shrewsbury]].\n\nJoan was the widow of Robert de Harley of Willey and had a daughter and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from her own family and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had a considerable amount of [[jointure]] property from her first marriage \u2013 in Shropshire at [[Harley, Shropshire|Harley]], [[Gretton, Shropshire|Gretton]], Willey and [[Kenley, Shropshire|Kenley]], and in [[Worcestershire]] part of a manor at [[Hampton Lovett]],<ref name=mp/> known as Over Hall.<ref name=hampton>A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 3: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43102#s2 Hampton Lovett \u2013 Manors], cf. footnote 28.</ref> Some of these properties passed to Roger Willey, a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400,<ref name=mp/> presumably on Joan's death: Willey was a business associate of Darras.<ref name=cpr1405-08-271/> The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall.<ref name=hampton/>\n\nJoan was almost certainly some years older than Darras. It is not clear whether they had children, although Darras may have left a son named Roger.<ref name=mp/> Joan seems to have died around the turn of the century, with her properties largely leaving his control, prompting Darras to an active and fairly successful search for further sources of income in the years following.\n\nJoan's family, the Corbets of [[Moreton Corbet Castle]] were one of the rising gentry families, steadily increasing their estates and their influence.<ref name=landlords>Baugh and Elrington (1989), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol4/pp72-118#h3-0002 Domesday Book: 1300\u20131540: Landlords]</ref> However, they were not of the first rank, and both they and Darras were increasingly to seek advancement through the [[affinities|affinity]] of the FitzAlans, the [[Earls of Arundel]], who were supreme both economically and politically in Shropshire as well being among the greatest magnates in England.\n\n==The Corbet property disputes==\n[[File:Richard II King of England.jpg|thumb|Richard II, who intervened in and profited from the Corbet property disputes.]]\nJoan Corbet's brother, [[Roger Corbet (died 1395)|Sir Roger]], was preoccupied with family disputes over property, many of which involved Joan. Darras inevitably took his wife's side, sometimes bringing him into disrepute with the king and his government.\n\nRoger Corbet had two older brothers, Thomas and John, as well as a younger brother, John, and sisters, including Joan, who was possibly the eldest of the siblings.<ref name=visitation>[https://archive.org/stream/visitationshrop00britgoog#page/n188/mode/2up Visitation of Shropshire, p. 134.]</ref> Roger and Joan's parents, Robert and Elizabeth Corbet, had been concerned to keep the family estates together in a time of short life-spans and tortuous succession that affected many landowning families.

The inquisition into the earl's Shropshire lands listed the numerous small grants of land he had made to his affinity and others whom he needed to cultivate. One of these was a small estate at [[Gretton, Shropshire]], held by Darras and worth 40 [[shilling]]s annually.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000047592476;view=1up;seq=124 Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery), 1392\u20131399, p. 114.]</ref> It seems, however, that Darras also had good contacts in the Lancastrian affinity. Earlier in the year, together with Edward Whitton, Henry Wynnesbury, and Fulk Pembridge, Darras was involved in some transaction that required each to pay \u00a3200 to [[Walter Blount (soldier)|Sir Walter Blount]],<ref>[http://search.shropshirehistory.org.uk/collections/getrecord/CCA_X3365_67_47/ Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/47, Recognizances 1396\u20131397], at Discovering Shropshire's History.</ref> An important participant in [[John of Gaunt]]'s military adventures abroad and his leading representative in the Midlands.<ref>Roskell et al, [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/blount-sir-walter-1403 BLOUNT, Sir Walter (d.1403), of Barton Blount, Derbys.] \u2013 Author: C.R.</ref>\n\nWhen John of Gaunt's son and dispossessed successor, [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] arrived in England to challenge Richard in 1399, the Arundels rallied to the cause of the [[House of Lancaster]], formerly their bitter enemies: the dead earl's son, [[Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel]], and brother, [[Thomas Arundel]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], became mainstays of the government of Bolingbroke, who came to the throne as Henry IV. Darras seems to have good connections with both parts of the victorious coalition and from this point he contrived to remain in royal favour, albeit sometimes with difficulty. He was made keeper for life of [[Morfe Forest|Morfe]] and Shirlet, areas of [[Royal forest]] on either side of the [[Severn]] in Shropshire, by [[letters patent]] of 4 November 1399.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/calendarpatentr16offigoog#page/n75/mode/2up Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399\u20131401, p. 64.]</ref> After his loyal service against the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising]] in Wales, a major preoccupation of both Arundel and the king,  further letters patent in February 1407, described Darras as the \"king's esquire,\" and confirmed that the office was indeed a reward for his military service and permitted him to appoint a ranger as a deputy to act in his absences.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015031079588;view=1up;seq=308 Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405\u20131408, p. 296.]</ref>\n\nIt was probably his connection with the FitzAlans that assured his appointment as [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]] for 1401-2. Before he took up the shrievalty, his friend [[John Cornwall (c.1366-1414)|Sir John Cornwall]], a former sheriff and also a former retainer of John of Gaunt, was accused of cattle rustling at Wytheford (also rendered Withiford) in Shropshire.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/collectionsforhi15staf#page/n243/mode/2up Collections for a History of Staffordshire, volume 15, p. 102.]</ref> Cornwall counted as family, as he was a grandson of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere, and so a first cousin of Darras's wife.<ref name=cornwall/> However, the case affected the king's interests, as the plaintiffs, who were demanding \u00a3100, alleged that their cattle had already been taken into the custody of the county escheator when Cornwall removed them.<ref name=chs15-103>[https://archive.org/stream/collectionsforhi15staf#page/n245/mode/2up Collections for a History of Staffordshire, volume 15, p. 103.]</ref> In April 1402 Darras was one of four local gentry who stood surety at Westminster for Cornwall that he would keep the peace,<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/records/item/581522-redirection Calendar of Close Rolls, 1399\u20131402, p. 555.]</ref> an act that potentially created a conflict of interest.

At Sidbury the advowson was contested. On 6 July, as a new rector was needed at Sidbury, Henry St George acted as patron, presenting William Walkebache. On 11 August, however, [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall]], also acting as patron and described as lord of Sidbury, presented Walter Lawrence.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyyork21unknuoft#page/n189/mode/2up Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 173.]</ref> Talbot, the young son of Richard, Lord Talbot, and Ankaret le Strange,<ref name=ls288/> was to emerge as Arundel's main political rival in the county, prepared to fight force with force.<ref>Roskell et al, [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/constituencies/shropshire Shropshire] \u2013 Author: L.

After presiding over a lengthy hearing, Judge White issued a four-page sealed ruling in May obtained by the ''Daily Herald''. White ruled that prosecutors proved Peterson killed both Savio and Stacy \"by a preponderance of the evidence,\" but nearly all statements attributed to Stacy \"do not provide sufficient safeguards of reliability.\" (The standard of proof in homicide cases is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\"; \"preponderance of the evidence\" is the standard for fact-finding on questions of admissibility of evidence, even in a criminal case.) Stacy's statements were crucial to the prosecution's case, as it lacked significant direct evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/07/21/Setback-for-Peterson-prosecution/UPI-55301279728992/ |work=UPI.com |title=Setback for Peterson Prosecution |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> In April 2012, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors could use eight statements made by both the victim prior to her death and by Peterson's still-missing fourth wife Stacy prior to her disappearance, reversing White's earlier decision. Peterson's defense had contended that introduction of these alleged hearsay comments constituted a violation of his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to confront any witnesses testifying against him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drew Peterson hearing set for Friday|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/04/justice/illinois-peterson-trial/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Illinois State Legislature]] attempted to help the prosecution with the passage of a new Illinois law, 725 ILCS 5/115-10.6, or \"Drew's Law\", which allows prosecutors to enter hearsay statements into evidence under certain conditions. Passed while investigators were looking for Stacy, the legislation permits courts to consider statements from \"unavailable witnesses,\" provided that prosecutors are able to prove that the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony and that the hearsay statements are reliable. Analysis by the trial court under this new law led to eight out of fourteen hearsay statements being ruled inadmissible because they were insufficiently reliable. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, ruling that the [[common law]] doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, which is less restrictive than \"Drew's Law\", would allow the statements to be admitted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holdridge|first1=William|title=People v.

Passed while investigators were looking for Stacy, the legislation permits courts to consider statements from \"unavailable witnesses,\" provided that prosecutors are able to prove that the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony and that the hearsay statements are reliable. Analysis by the trial court under this new law led to eight out of fourteen hearsay statements being ruled inadmissible because they were insufficiently reliable.

As of 2016, the Tejas Mark 1 was in production for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the naval version was undergoing flight tests for Indian Navy (IN).

The \"Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981\" noted that the MiG-21s would be approaching the end of their service lives by the mid-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would lack 40 percent of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.<ref name=\"globalsecurity\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/lca.htm \"Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).\"] ''Global Security'', 2012.

Neither [assistant] Fred, empty Beck's bottles, nor the sweet smell of the dawn of the age of PCR could replace Jenny. I was lonesome.\"<ref name=\"esquire 1994\" /> He received a $10,000 bonus from Cetus for the invention.<ref name=\"esquire 1994\" />\n\nOther Cetus scientists, including [[Randall Saiki]] and [[Henry Erlich]], were placed on PCR projects to work on determining if PCR could amplify a specific human gene ([[betaglobin]]) from genomic DNA.

In 1986, Saiki started to use ''[[Thermophilus aquaticus]]'' (Taq) [[DNA polymerase]] to amplify segments of DNA. The Taq polymerase was heat resistant and only need to be added to the reaction once, making the technique dramatically more affordable and subject to automation.

Neither [assistant] Fred, empty Beck's bottles, nor the sweet smell of the dawn of the age of PCR could replace Jenny. I was lonesome.\"<ref name=\"esquire 1994\" /> He received a $10,000 bonus from Cetus for the invention.<ref name=\"esquire 1994\" />\n\nOther Cetus scientists, including [[Randall Saiki]] and [[Henry Erlich]], were placed on PCR projects to work on determining if PCR could amplify a specific human gene ([[betaglobin]]) from genomic DNA.

Rabinow, a [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] scholar interested in issues of the production of knowledge, used the topic to argue against the idea that scientific discovery is the product of individual work, writing, \"Committees and science journalists like the idea of associating a unique idea with a unique person, the lone genius. PCR is thought by some to be an example of teamwork, but by others as the genius of one who was smart enough to put things together which were present to all, but overlooked.
