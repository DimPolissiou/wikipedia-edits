{"title_page": "Artificial stupidity", "text_new": "{{original research|date=December 2010}}\n\n'''Artificial Stupidity''' is commonly used as a humorous opposite of the term [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), often as a [[derogatory]] reference to the inability of an AI program to adequately perform basic tasks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, within the field of [[computer science]], ''artificial stupidity'' is also used to refer to a technique of \"[[dumbing down]]\" [[computer programs]] in order to deliberately introduce errors in their responses.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Alan Turing]], in his 1952 paper ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]'', proposed a test for intelligence which has since become known as the [[Turing test]].<ref name=\"turing\">{{Turing 1950}}</ref> While there are a number of different versions, the original test, described by Turing as being based on the \"[[Imitation Game (Turing test)|Imitation Game]]\", involved a \"machine intelligence\" (a computer running an AI program), a female participant, and an interrogator. Both the AI and the female participant were to claim that they were female, and the interrogator's task was to work out which was the female participant and which was not by examining the participant's responses to typed questions.<ref name=\"turing\" /> While it is not clear whether or not Turing intended that the interrogator was to know that one of the participants was a computer, while discussing some of the possible objections to his argument Turing raised the concern that \"machines cannot make mistakes\".<ref name=\"turing\" />\n\n{{quote|It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the man simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be unmasked because of its deadly accuracy.|Turing, 1950|page 448}}\n\nAs Turing then noted, the reply to this is a simple one: the machine should ''not'' attempt to \"give the ''right'' answers to the arithmetic problems\".<ref name=\"turing\" /> Instead, deliberate errors should be introduced to the computer's responses.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nWithin computer science, there are at least two major applications for artificial stupidity: the generation of deliberate errors in [[chatbots]] attempting to pass the Turing test or to otherwise fool a participant into believing that they are human; and the deliberate limitation of computer AIs in [[video games]] in order to control the game's difficulty.\n\n=== Chatbots ===\n\nThe first [[Loebner prize]] competition was run in 1991. As reported in ''[[The Economist]]'', the winning entry incorporated deliberate errors&nbsp;\u2013 described by ''The Economist'' as \"artificial stupidity\"&nbsp;\u2013 to fool the judges into believing that it was human.<ref name=\"economist\">{{Citation | title = Artificial Stupidity | date = 1992-09-01 | journal = [[The Economist]] | volume = 324 | issue = 7770 | pages = 14 |url= http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/ |quote= the first event was held in 1991}}</ref> This technique has remained a part of the subsequent Loebner prize competitions, and reflects the issue first raised by Turing.\n\n=== Game design ===\n\nLars Lid\u00e9n argues that good game design involves finding a balance between the computer's \"intelligence\" and the player's ability to win. By finely tuning the level of \"artificial stupidity\", it is possible to create computer controlled plays that allow the player to win, but do so \"without looking unintelligent\".<ref name=\"liden\">{{citation | last = Lid\u00e9n | first = Lars | year = 2004 | title = Artificial Stupidity: The art of making intentional mistakes | editor = S. Rabin | work = AI Game Programming Wisdom 2 | pages = 41\u201348 | publisher = Charles River Media, Inc.}}</ref>\n\n''Algorithms''\n\nThere are many ways to deliberately introduce poor decision-making in search algorithms. Take the [[minimax]] algorithm for example. The [[minimax]] algorithm is an adversarial search algorithm that is popularly used in games that require more than one player to compete against each other. The main purpose in this algorithm is to choose a move that maximizes your chance of winning and avoid moves that maximizes the chance of your opponent winning. An algorithm like this would be extremely beneficial to the computer as computers are able to search thousands of moves ahead. To \"dumb down\" this algorithm to allow for different difficulty levels, [[heuristic]] functions have to be tweaked. Normally, huge points are given in winning states. Tweaking the [[heuristic]] by reducing such big payoffs would reduce the chance of the algorithm in choosing the winning state.\n\nCreating [[heuristic]] functions to allow for stupidity is more difficult than one might think. If a [[heuristic]] allows for the best move, the computer opponent would be too omniscient, making the game frustrating and unenjoyable. But if the [[heuristic]] is poor, the game might also be unenjoyable. Therefore, a balance of good moves and bad moves in an adversarial game relies on a well-implemented [[heuristic]] function.\n\n=== Other applications ===\nAccording to its definition, a sufficiently developed Artificial Stupidity program would be able to make all the worst cases regarding a given situation. This would enable computer programmers and analysts to find flaws immediately while minimizing errors that are within the code.\n\nHowever, it is mostly expected to be used within the development and debugging stages of computer software.\n\n=== Arguments on artificial stupidity ===\n\nThe Economist states that if we are to achieve Alan Turing's prediction, \"it will be a dreadful anticlimax.\" It is a much pointless attempt to create a machine that mimics the behaviour and intelligent level of a human being. The purpose of the invention of the computer is to assist humans in performing tasks that would be deemed too tedious or time consuming to perform by hand.<ref name=\"economist\"/>\n\nAs mentioned in the passage regarding the Loebnizer prize competition, the computer was able to trick judges by introducing deliberate typing errors. The Economist argues that nobody would want a computer that couldn't type properly.<ref name=\"economist\"/>\n\nDurham, T., an author of the journal \"On Artificial Stupidity,\" seems to view computers as naturally possessing intelligence. It is only due to bad programming that a computer appears unintelligent. Durham states the opposite in what people would normally believe as \"there is no such thing as AI, only artificial stupidity, which is what happens when computers are not given the knowledge they need.\"<ref>Durham, T. (21 March 1985), \"On Artificial Stupidity\", ''Computing, The Magazine'' pp: 4-5</ref>\n\n=== Artificial stupidity as a limitation of artificial intelligence ===\n\nArtificial stupidity is not just delivering deliberate errors into the computer, but it could also be seen as a limitation of computer artificial intelligence. Dr. Jay Liebowitz argues that \"if intelligence and stupidity naturally exist, and if AI is said to exist, then is there something that might be called \"artificial stupidity?\"\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liebowitz|first=Jay|title=If There is Artificial Intelligence, Is There Such Thing As Artificial Stupidity?|journal=SIGART Newsletter|date=July 1989|volume=109}}</ref>\n\nLiebowitz pointed out that the limitations are:\n\n{{quote|\n* Ability to possess and use common sense\n* Development of deep reasoning systems\n* Ability to vary an expert system's explanation capability\n* Ability to get expert systems to learn\n* Ability to have distributed expert systems\n* Ability to easily acquire and update knowledge|Liebowitz, 1989|Page 109}}\n\nThe term has appeared in connection with other subject areas, mostly related to computing technology but also with respect to human behaviour. [[Sadie Plant]] suggests that [[Ada Lovelace]], the nineteenth century prophetess of computing, employed something like artificial stupidity to criticize those who underestimated the future potential for calculating machines<ref>Plant, S., 1998.

[[Hito Steyerl]] has been applying the term with reference to the stupidity of not recognizing the power and dangers of algorithms because of their invisibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/data-streams/|title=Data Streams|last=Steyerl|first=Hito|last2=Crawford|first2=Kate|date=23 January 2017|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref> On a different note, artificial stupidity, for [[Avital Ronell|Avital Ronnel]], describes the shocking misuse of intelligence measurement during the [[Eugenics in the United States|eugenics era in the USA]]: people were artificially deemed unintelligent.<ref>Ronell, A., 2002.

Artificial stupidity can refer to the, usually dubious, human ability to \"act stupid\" or \"[[dumbing down|dumb down]]\" but he suggests that it can also be a means of creative unearthing.

He created ''The Venture Bros.'' storyline sometime prior to 2000.<ref>http://www.skwigly.co.uk/jackson-publick/</ref> After working for the television program ''[[Sheep in the Big City]]'' and the live-action version of ''The Tick'', McCulloch set to turning ''The Venture Bros.'' into an animated series. ''The Venture Bros.'' was originally conceived as a [[comic book]] story for an issue of ''Monkeysuit''. McCulloch realized that his notes were too extensive for a short comics story and proposed that [[Comedy Central]] air ''The Venture Bros.'' as an animated series, but the network rejected it. Although the first draft of the pilot script was written in the spring of 2000, the premise was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until around the summer of 2002 by Adult Swim. McCulloch had not previously considered [[Cartoon Network]] because he \"didn't want to tone ''The Venture Bros.'' down,\" and was unaware of the existence of the network's late night adult-oriented programming block, Adult Swim.\n\nWith the revised pilot, production began in autumn of that year, and the pilot was first run on February 16, 2003. The first season of the series was completed and premiered in 2004, and it was added to the summer schedule in August.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web|url=http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/11320.html |title=It's That Time Again... |accessdate=June 21, 2006 |author=Jackson Publick |authorlink=Christopher McCulloch |date=2005-12-20 |publisher=Livejournal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718015654/http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/11320.html |archivedate=July 18, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Venture Bros. characters}}\nThe characters of ''The Venture Bros.'' are largely re-imaginings of the characters from ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', comic book [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, and of other famous figures from [[popular culture]].\n\n* [[Hank Venture|Hank]] (voiced by Christopher McCulloch) and [[Dean Venture]] (voiced by [[Michael Sinterniklaas]]) are the titular [[fraternal twin]] brothers of the show. Hank is the more adventurous and Dean is the more timid and bookish of the two. The two teenagers often wind up in perilous situations, and (as revealed in the second season) have been killed over a dozen times, only to be replaced with exact clones who have no memory of their own deaths. The title ''The Venture Bros.'' has been reconceptualized throughout the series, with the introduction of Rusty's twin brother Jonas Jr., and Hank and Dean's illegitimate half-brother, [[Dermott Fictel]]. The identity of Hank and Dean's mother remains the subject of some debate.\n* [[List of The Venture Bros. characters#Team Venture|Dr. Thaddeus \"Rusty\" Venture]] (voiced by [[James Urbaniak]]), a former boy adventurer and inspiration for the \"Rusty Venture\" cartoon series, runs what remains of Venture Industries, a once-leading global corporation established by his super-scientist adventurer father Jonas. Since Jonas's death, Venture Industries has declined to a shadow of its former glory, now occupying only a portion of the vast and deteriorating Venture compound and external locations including a base on Spider Skull Island and the space station Gargantua-1, all built by Jonas.

Appointed by the [[Office of Secret Intelligence]] (OSI), the muscular and hyper-masculine Brock frequently uses his [[license to kill (concept)|license to kill]] to protect the Venture family from any threat with sudden and brutal violence. He is a ruthless (and somewhat sadistic) hand-to-hand combatant, usually preferring to use a combat knife, his hands and feet, or his vintage Dodge Charger rather than firearms; the Monarch refers to him fearfully as Venture's \"Swedish murder machine\" (\"[[Dia de Los Dangerous!]]\"). In the fourth season, Brock Samson is replaced as bodyguard by [[List of The Venture Bros. characters#Team Venture|Sergeant Hatred]] (voiced by McCulloch), a former supervillain. Prior to becoming their bodyguard, Hatred was assigned to be the Venture family's arch-enemy. Hatred is also a \"cured\" [[pedophile]]; his pedophilia is actually controlled by an experimental drug (\"Nomolestol\") given to him by the OSI and its effectiveness has varied wildly between episodes.  Season 6 sees Samson return to his position as the Venture's official bodyguard while Sgt. Hatred becomes security for the new Venture compound in New York City.\n* Dr. Venture's deceased father, Dr. Jonas Venture (voiced by [[Paul Boocock]]), was the model super-scientist of his day. He was a visionary who changed the world with his inventions, and stands as the inspiration for most other protagonists in the series. He formed \"Team Venture\", a collection of friends and associates that helped him fight crime and subsequently save his son (Dr. Venture) from his arch-enemies. To help his son cope without a mother figure, he developed a loyal and rather emotional [[robot]] named [[H.E.L.P.eR.]] (listed in episode credits as voiced by \"Soul-Bot\") that accompanies and assists the Ventures. Early in the series, he was portrayed as a model man and father. However, later episodes show him as callous and uncaring about his son's well being, while showcasing questionable ethics, both medically and socially. In the fourth-season episode [[List of The Venture Bros. episodes|\"Self-Medication\"]], there is a scene showing the young Rusty Venture receiving psychotherapy from his father. As Rusty says that he longs for a normal childhood, Jonas interrupts him and insists that he is ungrateful for the opportunities given to him. In general, Jonas' portrayal has shown him to be less and less of a sympathetic character as the series progresses.\n\nThroughout the series, the Venture family has had various recurring antagonists. Many are current or former members of The Guild of Calamitous Intent, an organization founded to save mankind from self-destruction but which now serves as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' placement agency matching super villains with appropriate heroic nemeses. The organization is run by the mysterious leader known only as \"The Sovereign\", who is revealed to appear to be real-life rock star [[David Bowie]] in episode 26, though in episode 5 of the 5th season it is revealed that The Sovereign is actually a shape-shifter who frequently impersonates Bowie.\n\n* The Venture Family's primary nemesis is the pernicious but ineffective super-villain the [[Monarch (The Venture Bros.)|Monarch]] (voiced by McCulloch). Assuming the motif of a [[monarch butterfly]] and \"arching\" Dr. Venture since college, the Monarch will stop at nothing to antagonize Dr. Venture (even though his motive is unknown). Accompanying the Monarch is the masculine-voiced [[Dr. Girlfriend]] (voiced by [[Doc Hammer]]), referred to by the Monarch as \"Dr. Mrs. The Monarch\" after their wedding.\n* Baron Werner \u00dcnterbheit (voiced by [[T. Ryder Smith]]) is a former dictator of \u00dcnterland and bears a grudge against Venture.  He blames Venture for the loss of his jaw in college, citing \"One is always supposed to look out for one's lab partner!\". The season three premiere reveals that the Monarch was responsible for the explosion that destroyed \u00dcnterbheit's jaw, in an early attempt to kill Venture.\n* [[Phantom Limb (The Venture Bros.)|Phantom Limb]] (voiced by [[James Urbaniak]]) is a ruthless killer, villain insurance agent, and high-ranking Guild member (or was until he tried to usurp the Sovereign). Also, he was the former lover of Dr. Girlfriend before she left him to become The Monarch's companion.\n* The Ventures' friends and acquaintances include expert [[necromancy|necromancer]] [[Doctor Byron Orpheus]] (voiced by [[Steven Rattazzi]]) and his apathetic, teenage [[goth subculture|goth]] daughter [[Triana Orpheus|Triana]] (voiced by [[Lisa Hammer]]), who rent a portion of the Venture Compound; the [[albinism|albino]] computer scientist [[Pete White (The Venture Bros.)|Pete White]] (voiced by McCulloch), a former college friend of Dr. Venture's; [[hydrocephalus|hydrocephalic]] \"boy genius\" [[Master Billy Quizboy]] (voiced by Hammer); and Dr. Jonas Venture, Jr. (Voiced by [[James Urbaniak]]), Dr. Venture's former parasitic twin brother who has success in all of the areas that Rusty does not. Surviving members of the original Team Venture have also appeared as well as Dr. Orpheus's teammates in the Order of the Triad.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Venture Bros. episodes}}\n{{:List of The Venture Bros. episodes}}\n\nMost episodes begin with a [[cold open]] and are shot to appear to be in letter-box format. Almost every episode features both a [[smash cut]] into the end credits, and a short [[Post-credits scene|scene following the credits]].\n\nThe second season of the series premiered on the internet via [[Adult Swim Fix]] on June 23, 2006 and on television on June 25, 2006; the season finished on October 15, 2006. The considerable delay between the end of the first season and the start of the second was partially caused by Adult Swim's delay in deciding whether to renew the show, primarily because the show is drawn and inked in the [[traditional animation]] style (albeit digitally), causing each episode to take considerable time to move through production. Additionally, the producers were dealing with the time constraints of producing a first-season DVD that contained [[live action]] interviews and commentary for several episodes.\n\nThe third season began on June 1, 2008, and marked the beginning of the show's broadcast in [[High-definition video|high-definition]]. A 15-minute rough cut of \"[[The Doctor Is Sin]]\" aired on April 1, 2008, as part of Adult Swim's [[April Fool's Day]] theme of airing sneak peeks of new episodes.\n\nThe fourth season was split into two segments airing a year apart, with the first eight episodes airing in the fall of 2009 and the remaining episodes in fall of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/27886.html |title=A Bold New Day Dawns... |accessdate=2010-04-04 |author=Jackson Publick |date=2010-03-27 |publisher=Livejournal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718182517/http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/27886.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nA note contained in the closing credits of the Season 4 finale indicated that the series would continue into a fifth season.\n\nOn February 6, 2013, it was announced that Season 5 would premiere on May 19, 2013.

They tentatively stated that Season 6 would premiere in Fall of 2014, or very early 2015 at the latest.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/08/venture_bros_creators_doc_hammer_and_jackson_publick_interview_with_exclusive.html \"A Conversation About The Venture Bros.

Two-time directing partner and storyboard director for season six, Juno Lee, took over as the series director. Barry J. Kelly also served as Lee's co-director.\n\nSince the first season, two credits have changed every episode. [[H.E.L.P.eR.#Soul-bot voice credits|Soul-bot's \"voicing\"]] the character [[H.E.L.P.eR.]], and another as a nickname for animation director Kimson Albert. Each nickname is a quote from its respective episode; Albert left the series after Season 4.

Dr. Venture is modeled after what a child such as Jonny Quest might have grown up to be like after having lived through a childhood filled with bizarre, life-threatening events. Brock is modeled on [[Race Bannon]]. The Venture boys are based on the [[Hardy Boys]] and take the places of Jonny and Hadji. In the episode \"[[Ice Station \u2013 Impossible!]]\", Brock mentions that he had served with Race Bannon on several occasions. He regards his fellow agent with respect calling him \"one of the best\". One newspaper critic remarked, \"If filmmakers [[Woody Allen]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had collaborated on ''Jonny Quest'', it would have come out a lot like this.\"<ref name=\"animag\">{{cite journal | last = Gilbertson | first = Jon M. | title = Cartoon Network's Adult Swim shows hooking ratings | date=2004-11-22 | journal = The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20041122/ai_n11003026 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113034236/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20041122/ai_n11003026 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-01-13 | format = &ndash;<sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AGilbertson+intitle%3ACartoon+Network%27s+Adult+Swim+shows+hooking+ratings&as_publication=The+Milwaukee+Journal+Sentinel&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref> In season 2, Jonny Quest was introduced into the show as ''Action Jonny'', a homeless drug addict who deeply resents his father.

Hammer in 2006 said, \"Yeah, failure, that's what ''Venture Bros.'' is all about. Beautiful sublime failure.\"<ref name=quote>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=281 |title=Quickcast Commentary:The Venture Bros. |accessdate=2006-06-21 |author=Jackson Publick |date=2006-06-21 |publisher=quickstopentertainment.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715123718/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=281 |archivedate=2006-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn the commentary for the episode \"[[Home Insecurity]]\",{{full citation needed|date=January 2019}} Hammer and Publick elaborated on the theme.\n\n<blockquote>Publick: \"This show... If you'll permit me to get 'big picture', this show is actually all about failure. Even in the design, everything is supposed to be kinda the death of the space-age dream world. The death of the jet-age promises.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Hammer: \"It's about the beauty of failure. It's about that failure happens to all of us...Every character is not only flawed, but sucks at what they do, and is beautiful at it and Jackson and I suck at what we do, and we try to be beautiful at it, and failure is how you get by...It shows that failure's funny, and it's beautiful and it's life, and it's okay, and it's all we can write because we are big...failures. (laughter)\" </blockquote>\n\nIn 2013, Publick and Hammer discussed moving away from the theme and embracing the \"successes\" of the characters as well.\n\n<blockquote>Publick: I think you and I are both sick of every interview mentioning the \u201cIt\u2019s a show about failure\u201d from five years ago. I don\u2019t think we made a conscious effort to fight that or anything, but every year, we push what we do as writers a little more. An area we hadn\u2019t gone into very much was positivity. I mean, all our victories are still satiric, but there are definitely places where we said, \u201cI want to see these guys do something. I don\u2019t want to just have everything fall on its face all the time.<ref name=success>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-creators-of-ithe-venture-brosi-walk-us-through-101554|title=The creators of The Venture Bros. walk us through the show's 5th season.|accessdate=2015-01-16|author=Jackson Publick|date=2013-08-14|publisher=avclub.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\nThe show has received critical acclaim over its run.

The series premiered on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] with a pilot episode on February 16, 2003 and its first season beginning on August 7, 2004.\n\nThe series chronicles the lives and adventures of the Venture family: well-meaning but incompetent teenagers [[Hank Venture|Hank]] and [[Dean Venture]]; their emotionally insecure, unethical and under-achieving super-scientist father [[Doctor Thaddeus Venture|Dr. Thaddeus \"Rusty\" Venture]]; the family's [[bodyguard]], [[secret agent]] [[Brock Samson]], or his temporary replacement, the reformed [[villain]] and [[Pederasty|pederast]] [[Sergeant Hatred]]; and the family's self-proclaimed [[arch-nemesis]], The [[Monarch (The Venture Bros.)|Monarch]], a butterfly-themed supervillain.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EGtTOAGYSWQC&pg=PA173&dq=%22venture+brothers%22  | date = 2006-08-30 | last = Booker| first = M.

The seventh season concluded on October 7, 2018; the series has been renewed for an eighth season.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Venture Home News Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheVentureHomeNews/photos/a.214316528582781.67661.214303228584111/1610989525582134/?type=3&theater|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=February 1, 2017|archivedate=September 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170930202943/https://www.facebook.com/TheVentureHomeNews/photos/a.214316528582781.67661.214303228584111/1610989525582134/?type=3&theater|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:SDCC 2010 Adult Swim panel 01.jpg|thumb|left|Series co-writers [[Doc Hammer]] (left) and [[Christopher McCulloch]] (right) at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nShow creator McCulloch was one of the main writers for the [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning]] animated series ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]''. He created ''The Venture Bros.'' storyline sometime prior to 2000.<ref>http://www.skwigly.co.uk/jackson-publick/</ref> After working for the television program ''[[Sheep in the Big City]]'' and the live-action version of ''The Tick'', McCulloch set to turning ''The Venture Bros.'' into an animated series. ''The Venture Bros.'' was originally conceived as a [[comic book]] story for an issue of ''Monkeysuit''. McCulloch realized that his notes were too extensive for a short comics story and proposed that [[Comedy Central]] air ''The Venture Bros.'' as an animated series, but the network rejected it. Although the first draft of the pilot script was written in the spring of 2000, the premise was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until around the summer of 2002 by Adult Swim. McCulloch had not previously considered [[Cartoon Network]] because he \"didn't want to tone ''The Venture Bros.'' down,\" and was unaware of the existence of the network's late night adult-oriented programming block, Adult Swim.\n\nWith the revised pilot, production began in autumn of that year, and the pilot was first run on February 16, 2003. The first season of the series was completed and premiered in 2004, and it was added to the summer schedule in August.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web|url=http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/11320.html |title=It's That Time Again... |accessdate=June 21, 2006 |author=Jackson Publick |authorlink=Christopher McCulloch |date=2005-12-20 |publisher=Livejournal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718015654/http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/11320.html |archivedate=July 18, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Venture Bros. characters}}\nThe characters of ''The Venture Bros.'' are largely re-imaginings of the characters from ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', comic book [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s, and of other famous figures from [[popular culture]].\n\n* [[Hank Venture|Hank]] (voiced by Christopher McCulloch) and [[Dean Venture]] (voiced by [[Michael Sinterniklaas]]) are the titular [[fraternal twin]] brothers of the show. Hank is the more adventurous and Dean is the more timid and bookish of the two. The two teenagers often wind up in perilous situations, and (as revealed in the second season) have been killed over a dozen times, only to be replaced with exact clones who have no memory of their own deaths. The title ''The Venture Bros.'' has been reconceptualized throughout the series, with the introduction of Rusty's twin brother Jonas Jr., and Hank and Dean's illegitimate half-brother, [[Dermott Fictel]]. The identity of Hank and Dean's mother remains the subject of some debate.\n* [[List of The Venture Bros. characters#Team Venture|Dr. Thaddeus \"Rusty\" Venture]] (voiced by [[James Urbaniak]]), a former boy adventurer and inspiration for the \"Rusty Venture\" cartoon series, runs what remains of Venture Industries, a once-leading global corporation established by his super-scientist adventurer father Jonas. Since Jonas's death, Venture Industries has declined to a shadow of its former glory, now occupying only a portion of the vast and deteriorating Venture compound and external locations including a base on Spider Skull Island and the space station Gargantua-1, all built by Jonas. Dr. Venture &ndash; Rusty dropped out of college shortly after his father's death, and his academic credentials have been questioned<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Incredible Mr. Brisby |episodelink= List of The Venture Bros. episodes#ep104|series=The Venture Bros.|credits=Jackson Publick|network=[[Cartoon Network]] |station=[[Adult Swim]] |date=August 28, 2004 |season=1 |number=104}}</ref> and it is instead stated he only holds an honorary degree from a [[Tijuana]] community college<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Pomp & Circuitry |episodelink= List of The Venture Bros. episodes#ep410|series=The Venture Bros.|credits=Jackson Publick|network=Cartoon Network|station=Adult Swim|date=September 19, 2010 |season=4 |number=410}}</ref> &ndash; attempts to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a super-scientist himself, although his competence frequently falls short of his father's and he usually demonstrates questionable ethics, leading others to claim that his occasional successes merely capitalize on the work of his late father.\n* [[List of The Venture Bros. characters#O.S.I.|Brock Samson]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]]) is the longstanding bodyguard to the Venture family. Appointed by the [[Office of Secret Intelligence]] (OSI), the muscular and hyper-masculine Brock frequently uses his [[license to kill (concept)|license to kill]] to protect the Venture family from any threat with sudden and brutal violence. He is a ruthless (and somewhat sadistic) hand-to-hand combatant, usually preferring to use a combat knife, his hands and feet, or his vintage Dodge Charger rather than firearms; the Monarch refers to him fearfully as Venture's \"Swedish murder machine\" (\"[[Dia de Los Dangerous!]]\"). In the fourth season, Brock Samson is replaced as bodyguard by [[List of The Venture Bros. characters#Team Venture|Sergeant Hatred]] (voiced by McCulloch), a former supervillain. Prior to becoming their bodyguard, Hatred was assigned to be the Venture family's arch-enemy. Hatred is also a \"cured\" [[pedophile]]; his pedophilia is actually controlled by an experimental drug (\"Nomolestol\") given to him by the OSI and its effectiveness has varied wildly between episodes.  Season 6 sees Samson return to his position as the Venture's official bodyguard while Sgt. Hatred becomes security for the new Venture compound in New York City.\n* Dr. Venture's deceased father, Dr. Jonas Venture (voiced by [[Paul Boocock]]), was the model super-scientist of his day. He was a visionary who changed the world with his inventions, and stands as the inspiration for most other protagonists in the series. He formed \"Team Venture\", a collection of friends and associates that helped him fight crime and subsequently save his son (Dr. Venture) from his arch-enemies. To help his son cope without a mother figure, he developed a loyal and rather emotional [[robot]] named [[H.E.L.P.eR.]] (listed in episode credits as voiced by \"Soul-Bot\") that accompanies and assists the Ventures. Early in the series, he was portrayed as a model man and father. However, later episodes show him as callous and uncaring about his son's well being, while showcasing questionable ethics, both medically and socially. In the fourth-season episode [[List of The Venture Bros. episodes|\"Self-Medication\"]], there is a scene showing the young Rusty Venture receiving psychotherapy from his father. As Rusty says that he longs for a normal childhood, Jonas interrupts him and insists that he is ungrateful for the opportunities given to him. In general, Jonas' portrayal has shown him to be less and less of a sympathetic character as the series progresses.\n\nThroughout the series, the Venture family has had various recurring antagonists. Many are current or former members of The Guild of Calamitous Intent, an organization founded to save mankind from self-destruction but which now serves as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' placement agency matching super villains with appropriate heroic nemeses. The organization is run by the mysterious leader known only as \"The Sovereign\", who is revealed to appear to be real-life rock star [[David Bowie]] in episode 26, though in episode 5 of the 5th season it is revealed that The Sovereign is actually a shape-shifter who frequently impersonates Bowie.\n\n* The Venture Family's primary nemesis is the pernicious but ineffective super-villain the [[Monarch (The Venture Bros.)|Monarch]] (voiced by McCulloch). Assuming the motif of a [[monarch butterfly]] and \"arching\" Dr. Venture since college, the Monarch will stop at nothing to antagonize Dr. Venture (even though his motive is unknown). Accompanying the Monarch is the masculine-voiced [[Dr. Girlfriend]] (voiced by [[Doc Hammer]]), referred to by the Monarch as \"Dr. Mrs. The Monarch\" after their wedding.\n* Baron Werner \u00dcnterbheit (voiced by [[T. Ryder Smith]]) is a former dictator of \u00dcnterland and bears a grudge against Venture.  He blames Venture for the loss of his jaw in college, citing \"One is always supposed to look out for one's lab partner!\". The season three premiere reveals that the Monarch was responsible for the explosion that destroyed \u00dcnterbheit's jaw, in an early attempt to kill Venture.\n* [[Phantom Limb (The Venture Bros.)|Phantom Limb]] (voiced by [[James Urbaniak]]) is a ruthless killer, villain insurance agent, and high-ranking Guild member (or was until he tried to usurp the Sovereign). Also, he was the former lover of Dr. Girlfriend before she left him to become The Monarch's companion.\n* The Ventures' friends and acquaintances include expert [[necromancy|necromancer]] [[Doctor Byron Orpheus]] (voiced by [[Steven Rattazzi]]) and his apathetic, teenage [[goth subculture|goth]] daughter [[Triana Orpheus|Triana]] (voiced by [[Lisa Hammer]]), who rent a portion of the Venture Compound; the [[albinism|albino]] computer scientist [[Pete White (The Venture Bros.)|Pete White]] (voiced by McCulloch), a former college friend of Dr. Venture's; [[hydrocephalus|hydrocephalic]] \"boy genius\" [[Master Billy Quizboy]] (voiced by Hammer); and Dr. Jonas Venture, Jr. (Voiced by  James Urbaniak), Dr. Venture's former parasitic twin brother who has success in all of the areas that Rusty does not. Surviving members of the original Team Venture have also appeared as well as Dr. Orpheus's teammates in the Order of the Triad.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Venture Bros. episodes}}\n{{:List of The Venture Bros. episodes}}\n\nMost episodes begin with a [[cold open]] and are shot to appear to be in letter-box format. Almost every episode features both a [[smash cut]] into the end credits, and a short [[Post-credits scene|scene following the credits]].\n\nThe second season of the series premiered on the internet via [[Adult Swim Fix]] on June 23, 2006 and on television on June 25, 2006; the season finished on October 15, 2006. The considerable delay between the end of the first season and the start of the second was partially caused by Adult Swim's delay in deciding whether to renew the show, primarily because the show is drawn and inked in the [[traditional animation]] style (albeit digitally), causing each episode to take considerable time to move through production. Additionally, the producers were dealing with the time constraints of producing a first-season DVD that contained [[live action]] interviews and commentary for several episodes.\n\nThe third season began on June 1, 2008, and marked the beginning of the show's broadcast in [[High-definition video|high-definition]]. A 15-minute rough cut of \"[[The Doctor Is Sin]]\" aired on April 1, 2008, as part of Adult Swim's [[April Fool's Day]] theme of airing sneak peeks of new episodes.\n\nThe fourth season was split into two segments airing a year apart, with the first eight episodes airing in the fall of 2009 and the remaining episodes in fall of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/27886.html |title=A Bold New Day Dawns... |accessdate=2010-04-04 |author=Jackson Publick |date=2010-03-27 |publisher=Livejournal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718182517/http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/27886.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nA note contained in the closing credits of the Season 4 finale indicated that the series would continue into a fifth season.\n\nOn February 6, 2013, it was announced that Season 5 would premiere on May 19, 2013.

They tentatively stated that Season 6 would premiere in Fall of 2014, or very early 2015 at the latest.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/08/venture_bros_creators_doc_hammer_and_jackson_publick_interview_with_exclusive.html \"A Conversation About The Venture Bros.

Two-time directing partner and storyboard director for season six, Juno Lee, took over as the series director. Barry J. Kelly also served as Lee's co-director.\n\nSince the first season, two credits have changed every episode. [[H.E.L.P.eR.#Soul-bot voice credits|Soul-bot's \"voicing\"]] the character [[H.E.L.P.eR.]], and another as a nickname for animation director Kimson Albert. Each nickname is a quote from its respective episode; Albert left the series after Season 4.  In season two, each end credit sequence holds a different additional (fake) duty for ''AstroBase Go!''.<ref>Season 2 DVD commentary</ref>\n\n==Themes, homages, and references==\n\n===''Jonny Quest''===\n[[File:VBJQComparison.png|thumb|Comparing the main characters of ''The Venture Bros.'' and ''Jonny Quest'']]\n\nThe series' principal reference is to the 1964 animated science fiction adventure television series ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', as it is the basis for many of the main characters. Dr. Venture is modeled after what a child such as Jonny Quest might have grown up to be like after having lived through a childhood filled with bizarre, life-threatening events. Brock is modeled on [[Race Bannon]]. The Venture boys are based on the [[Hardy Boys]] and take the places of Jonny and Hadji. In the episode \"[[Ice Station \u2013 Impossible!]]\", Brock mentions that he had served with Race Bannon on several occasions. He regards his fellow agent with respect calling him \"one of the best\". One newspaper critic remarked, \"If filmmakers [[Woody Allen]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had collaborated on ''Jonny Quest'', it would have come out a lot like this.\"<ref name=\"animag\">{{cite journal | last = Gilbertson | first = Jon M. | title = Cartoon Network's Adult Swim shows hooking ratings | date=2004-11-22 | journal = The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20041122/ai_n11003026 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113034236/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20041122/ai_n11003026 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-01-13 | format = &ndash;<sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AGilbertson+intitle%3ACartoon+Network%27s+Adult+Swim+shows+hooking+ratings&as_publication=The+Milwaukee+Journal+Sentinel&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref> In season 2, Jonny Quest was introduced into the show as ''Action Jonny'', a homeless drug addict who deeply resents his father.

Hammer in 2006 said, \"Yeah, failure, that's what ''Venture Bros.'' is all about. Beautiful sublime failure.\"<ref name=quote>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=281 |title=Quickcast Commentary:The Venture Bros. |accessdate=2006-06-21 |author=Jackson Publick |date=2006-06-21 |publisher=quickstopentertainment.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715123718/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=281 |archivedate=2006-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn the commentary for the episode \"[[Home Insecurity]]\",{{full citation needed|date=January 2019}} Hammer and Publick elaborated on the theme.\n\n<blockquote>Publick: \"This show... If you'll permit me to get 'big picture', this show is actually all about failure. Even in the design, everything is supposed to be kinda the death of the space-age dream world. The death of the jet-age promises.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Hammer: \"It's about the beauty of failure. It's about that failure happens to all of us...Every character is not only flawed, but sucks at what they do, and is beautiful at it and Jackson and I suck at what we do, and we try to be beautiful at it, and failure is how you get by...It shows that failure's funny, and it's beautiful and it's life, and it's okay, and it's all we can write because we are big...failures. (laughter)\" </blockquote>\n\nIn 2013, Publick and Hammer discussed moving away from the theme and embracing the \"successes\" of the characters as well.\n\n<blockquote>Publick: I think you and I are both sick of every interview mentioning the \u201cIt\u2019s a show about failure\u201d from five years ago. I don\u2019t think we made a conscious effort to fight that or anything, but every year, we push what we do as writers a little more. An area we hadn\u2019t gone into very much was positivity.

In 1885, [[Queen Victoria]] created for Alexander Duff the title '''[[Earl of Fife]]''' in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25490 |date=14 July 1885 |page=3239 }}</ref>\n\nOn Saturday, 27 July 1889, Alexander, 1st Earl of Fife and 6th Earl Fife, married [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Princess Louise]], the third child and eldest daughter of the then-[[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]) and his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]], in the Private Chapel at [[Buckingham Palace]]. The couple were third cousins in descent from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The wedding marked the second time a descendant of Queen Victoria married a British subject.<ref>The first time a descendant of Queen Victoria married a British subject was the marriage of [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|The Princess Louise]], the Queen's fourth daughter, to the [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] in 1871.</ref> Two days after the wedding, the Queen elevated Alexander, Lord Fife, to the dignities of '''Duke of Fife''' and '''Marquess of Macduff''', in the County of Banff, in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25958 |date=27 July 1889 |page=4077 }}</ref> [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Letters Patent]] of 29 June 1889 creating these titles contained the standard remainder to \"heirs male of his body\". \n\nOn 24 April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] issued another Letters Patent by which she created for The 1st Duke of Fife the further dignities of '''Duke of Fife''' and '''Earl of Macduff''', both in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], and both with a special remainder that allowed these titles to pass to his daughters, in default of a son, and then to the male heirs of those daughters. The one restriction was that the mother of those daughters had to be [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Princess Louise]]; daughters from any subsequent marriage could not inherit.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27186 |date=24 April 1900 |page=2605}}</ref> On 9 November 1905, King Edward VII granted to [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|Alexander Duff]]'s two daughters [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife|Lady Alexandra]] (* 1891) and [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk|Lady Maud]] (* 1893) the styles of ''Highness'' and ''Princess''.\n\nUpon the death of [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|Alexander, 1st Duke of Fife]], in January 1912, the peerages created in 1889 (the dukedom of Fife of 1889 and the marquessate of Macduff) and all the older (as previously mentioned) peerages held by the Duff family (the barony of Braco of 1735, viscountcy of Macduff of 1759, [[Earl Fife|earldom Fife of 1759]], barony of Skene of 1857, [[Earl of Fife|earldom of Fife of 1885]]) became extinct, while the peerages created in 1900 (the dukedom of Fife of 1900 and the earldom of Macduff) passed to his elder daughter, [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife|Princess Alexandra]] (1891\u20131959). \n\nOn 15 October 1913, The 2nd Duchess of Fife married [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]], the only son of [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and thus a younger brother of her maternal grandfather King Edward VII.

Their only son, [[Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Alastair]], died in 1943.\n\nWhen The 2nd Duchess of Fife died in 1959, her hereditary peerages passed to her nephew [[James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife|James Carnegie]] (1929\u20132015), eldest son of her sister [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk|Maud]] and her husband [[Charles Carnegie, 11th Earl of Southesk]] (1893\u20131992). Thirty-three years later, in 1992, The 3rd Duke of Fife also succeeded his father as 12th [[Earl of Southesk]] and [[Clan chief|chief]] of the [[Clan Carnegie]]. As consequence, the following peerage titles became therefore subsidiary to that of the Dukedom: '''[[Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird]]''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] (created in 1616), '''[[Earl of Southesk]]''' and '''[[Lord Carnegie]]''' in the Peerage of Scotland (both created in 1633), '''[[Baron Balinhard]]''' in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] (created  in 1663; all previous mentioned titles awarded to [[David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk|Sir David Carnegie]] (1575\u20131658), an [[Extraordinary Lord of Session]]), and the '''[[Carnegie Baronets|Carnegie Baronetcy]]''' in the [[Baronetage of Nova Scotia]] (created in 1641 for [[Sir David Carnegie, 1st Baronet|David Carnegie of Pitcarrow]] (died 1708), a Scottish politician). Upon his death in 2015, he was succeeded in the Fife and Carnegie titles by his son, [[David Carnegie, 4th Duke of Fife|David Charles Carnegie]] (born 1961). The 4th Duke of Fife's [[heir apparent]] is his son Charles Duff Carnegie (born 1989), who uses the [[List of courtesy titles in the peerages of Britain and Ireland|courtesy title]] ''Earl of Southesk''.<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p17206.htm#i172051 Charles Duff Carnegie, Earl of Southesk] -  - website Thepeerage.com</ref> The hypothetical grandson of the duke and heir-to-heir apparent would be styled instead ''Lord Carnegie''.\n\n==Seats==\nThe family's current main residence is [[Kinnaird Castle, Brechin|Kinnaird Castle]] near the town of [[Brechin]] in [[Angus, Scotland]]. Another seat of the Duke is [[Elsick House]] near the town of [[Stonehaven]] in [[Aberdeenshire, Scotland]], within the watershed of the [[Burn of Elsick]]. The [[Mar Lodge]], to the west of the village of [[Braemar]] in [[Aberdeenshire, Scotland]], was bequeathed by [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife]], to her nephew [[Alexander Ramsay of Mar]], and subsequently sold.

The wedding marked the second time a descendant of Queen Victoria married a British subject.<ref>The first time a descendant of Queen Victoria married a British subject was the marriage of [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|The Princess Louise]], the Queen's fourth daughter, to the [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] in 1871.</ref> Two days after the wedding, the Queen elevated Alexander, Lord Fife, to the dignities of '''Duke of Fife''' and '''Marquess of Macduff''', in the County of Banff, in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25958 |date=27 July 1889 |page=4077 }}</ref> [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Letters Patent]] of 29 June 1889 creating these titles contained the standard remainder to \"heirs male of his body\". \n\nOn 24 April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] issued another Letters Patent by which she created for The 1st Duke of Fife the further dignities of '''Duke of Fife''' and '''Earl of Macduff''', both in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], and both with a special remainder that allowed these titles to pass to his daughters, in default of a son, and then to the male heirs of those daughters. The one restriction was that the mother of those daughters had to be [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Princess Louise]]; daughters from any subsequent marriage could not inherit.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27186 |date=24 April 1900 |page=2605}}</ref> On 9 November 1905, King Edward VII granted to [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|Alexander Duff]]'s two daughters [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife|Lady Alexandra]] (* 1891) and [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk|Lady Maud]] (* 1893) the styles of ''Highness'' and ''Princess''.\n\nUpon the death of [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|Alexander, 1st Duke of Fife]], in January 1912, the peerages created in 1889 (the dukedom of Fife of 1889 and the marquessate of Macduff) and all the older (as previously mentioned) peerages held by the Duff family (the barony of Braco of 1735, viscountcy of Macduff of 1759, [[Earl Fife|earldom Fife of 1759]], barony of Skene of 1857, [[Earl of Fife|earldom of Fife of 1885]]) became extinct, while the peerages created in 1900 (the dukedom of Fife of 1900 and the earldom of Macduff) passed to his elder daughter, [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife|Princess Alexandra]] (1891\u20131959). \n\nOn 15 October 1913, The 2nd Duchess of Fife married [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]], the only son of [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and thus a younger brother of her maternal grandfather King Edward VII. As such, Arthur and Alexandra were [[cousin|first cousins once removed]]. Their only son, [[Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Alastair]], died in 1943.\n\nWhen The 2nd Duchess of Fife died in 1959, her hereditary peerages passed to her nephew [[James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife|James Carnegie]] (1929\u20132015), eldest son of her sister [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk|Maud]] and her husband [[Charles Carnegie, 11th Earl of Southesk]] (1893\u20131992). Thirty-three years later, in 1992, The 3rd Duke of Fife also succeeded his father as 12th [[Earl of Southesk]] and [[Clan chief|chief]] of the [[Clan Carnegie]]. As consequence, the following peerage titles became therefore subsidiary to that of the Dukedom: '''[[Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird]]''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] (created in 1616), '''[[Earl of Southesk]]''' and '''[[Lord Carnegie]]''' in the Peerage of Scotland (both created in 1633), '''[[Baron Balinhard]]''' in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] (created  in 1663; all previous mentioned titles awarded to [[David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk|Sir David Carnegie]] (1575\u20131658), an [[Extraordinary Lord of Session]]), and the '''[[Carnegie Baronets|Carnegie Baronetcy]]''' in the [[Baronetage of Nova Scotia]] (created in 1641 for [[Sir David Carnegie, 1st Baronet|David Carnegie of Pitcarrow]] (died 1708), a Scottish politician). Upon his death in 2015, he was succeeded in the Fife and Carnegie titles by his son, [[David Carnegie, 4th Duke of Fife|David Charles Carnegie]] (born 1961). The 4th Duke of Fife's [[heir apparent]] is his son Charles Duff Carnegie (born 1989), who uses the [[List of courtesy titles in the peerages of Britain and Ireland|courtesy title]] ''Earl of Southesk''.<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p17206.htm#i172051 Charles Duff Carnegie, Earl of Southesk] -  - website Thepeerage.com</ref> The hypothetical grandson of the duke and heir-to-heir apparent would be styled instead ''Lord Carnegie''.\n\n==Seats==\nThe family's current main residence is [[Kinnaird Castle, Brechin|Kinnaird Castle]] near the town of [[Brechin]] in [[Angus, Scotland]]. Another seat of the Duke is [[Elsick House]] near the town of [[Stonehaven]] in [[Aberdeenshire, Scotland]], within the watershed of the [[Burn of Elsick]]. The [[Mar Lodge]], to the west of the village of [[Braemar]] in [[Aberdeenshire, Scotland]], was bequeathed by [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife]], to her nephew [[Alexander Ramsay of Mar]], and subsequently sold. The first two holders of the dukedom are buried in [[St Ninian's Chapel, Braemar]].\n\n==Coat of arms==\n===Arms of the 4th Duke===\nThe following [[heraldic achievement]] was matriculated by the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in 2017 for the [[David Carnegie, 4th Duke of Fife|4th Duke of Fife]]: \n*'''Shield''': Or, a Lion rampant Gules, armed and langued Azure ''(the Dukedom of Fife)'', and on an Inescutcheon Argent, ensigned of an Earl's Coronet proper, an Eagle displayed Azure, armed, beaked and membered Gules, and charged on its breast with an Antique Covered Cup Or ''(Carnegie)''. \n* '''Crest:''' A Thunderbolt proper, winged Or.\n* '''Supporters:''' Dexter: a Lion guardant Gules, langued Azure, collared with a Label of five-points Argent, charged with two Thistles proper, between three Crosses of St George Gules.
