[[The Dark Knight (film)|''The Dark Knight'']], from [[Christopher Nolan]]'s trilogy, is considered [[List of films considered the best|one of the best superhero movies ever]], while two entries, ''Batman and Robin'' and ''Catwoman'' are considered [[List of films considered the worst|some of the worst]]. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is the highest-grossing ''Batman'' movie, grossing $1,081,041,287 worldwide, while ''Batman and Robin'' is the lowest-grossing film to feature Batman, at $238,207,122 worldwide. Films in the series have earned three [[Academy Awards]] (Burton's ''Batman'' for Production Design and ''The Dark Knight'' for Sound Editing and posthumous Best Supporting Actor for [[Heath Ledger]]'s performance as the Joker), one [[BAFTAs|BAFTA]] (also for Ledger), and ten [[Saturn Awards]], which honor excellence in science fiction, horror, and fantasy.\n\nOf the 1980s and 1990s, Tim Burton's films received positive critical reviews for their return of the character to a more serious portrayal, though some felt that ''Batman Returns'' was too dark. Joel Schumacher's two films received mixed to negative reviews, particularly ''Batman and Robin'', which has the lowest aggregate scores out of any film in the series. Conversely, the films in Christopher Nolan's trilogy of the 2000s and 2010s have the highest scores on review aggregation websites of the live-action feature films with ''The Dark Knight'' receiving a 94% from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and an 84 from [[Metacritic]]. Batman's newer iterations in the 2010s DCEU received mixed to negative reviews from critics. \n\nThe series' theatrically-released animated movies have a large critical disparity, with ''Mask of the Phantasm'' and ''The Lego Batman Movie'' being well-received while ''Batman: The Killing Joke'' received mixed to negative reviews.\n\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=\"2\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{nowrap|{{Abbr|Ref(s)|References}}}}\n|-\n!

[[The Dark Knight (film)|''The Dark Knight'']], from [[Christopher Nolan]]'s trilogy, is considered [[List of films considered the best|one of the best superhero movies ever]], while two entries, ''Batman and Robin'' and ''Catwoman'' are considered [[List of films considered the worst|some of the worst]]. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is the highest-grossing ''Batman'' movie, grossing $1,081,041,287 worldwide, while ''Batman and Robin'' is the lowest-grossing film to feature Batman, at $238,207,122 worldwide. Films in the series have earned three [[Academy Awards]] (Burton's ''Batman'' for Production Design and ''The Dark Knight'' for Sound Editing and posthumous Best Supporting Actor for [[Heath Ledger]]'s performance as the Joker), one [[BAFTAs|BAFTA]] (also for Ledger), and ten [[Saturn Awards]], which honor excellence in science fiction, horror, and fantasy.\n\nOf the 1980s and 1990s, Tim Burton's films received positive critical reviews for their return of the character to a more serious portrayal, though some felt that ''Batman Returns'' was too dark. Joel Schumacher's two films received mixed to negative reviews, particularly ''Batman and Robin'', which has the lowest aggregate scores out of any film in the series. Conversely, the films in Christopher Nolan's trilogy of the 2000s and 2010s have the highest scores on review aggregation websites of the live-action feature films with ''The Dark Knight'' receiving a 94% from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and an 84 from [[Metacritic]]. Batman's newer iterations in the 2010s DCEU received mixed to negative reviews from critics. \n\nThe series' theatrically-released animated movies have a large critical disparity, with ''Mask of the Phantasm'' and ''The Lego Batman Movie'' being well-received while ''Batman: The Killing Joke'' received mixed to negative reviews.\n\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=\"2\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{nowrap|{{Abbr|Ref(s)|References}}}}\n|-\n!
