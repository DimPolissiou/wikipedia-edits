He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]) and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]])\u2014have been arrested and charged with the murder of captured [[Boer]]s and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the German Emperor\u2014[[Wilhelm II]]\u2014has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nThe defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Morant, Handcock and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which look bad. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy\".\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Morant and Handcock are charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese]].\n\nBolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Thomas manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Morant's friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat. When the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with many losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nThomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Thomas and his clients, Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the calibre of his rifle, \"Rule 303\". That night, Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nTaylor testifies that Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Colonel [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners. According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nThomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Bolton privately tells Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Thomas not to insist. In private Kitchener tells Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the British Army. He orders Hamilton to testify in his place and when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do\".\n\nThe following day, Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Denny comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Thomas explains that Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese. A Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Heese, with a rifle. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nOn stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons\". When Morant had confronted the Heese, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot dead, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting\".\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge\". At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts. The following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Bolton eyes him, Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me\". To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, even missionaries. That is why, after Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Heese. They celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]] but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]] and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it\". Next morning, the defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation and finds that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that London and the Australian Government support the verdict and sentences. There now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]]. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]] but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He says that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the war. This, Kitchener explains, is why Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all costs.\n\nAccording to the South African historian Charles Leach, the legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels\". \"No personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case\". Questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/> The scene contains a kernel of truth. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Morant, Handcock and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013107.</ref>\n* Major Robert Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make\". Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of other ranks and Colonel Hall===\nThe soldiers from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Morant, Handcock and Witton are depicted as motivated by grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corporal Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness and other offences. All are portrayed with British accents.\n\nHall the officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]] is depicted as fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favourable to the defence. Surviving documents tell that the arrest of the six defendants was ''ordered'' by Hall after a letter from the other ranks at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]] and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98\u2013101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\" but their arrests took place elsewhere. After the letter Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to kill the defendants. According to the Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124\u2013125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to the South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Captain Hunt===\nIn the film, Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to the South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\". A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him on screen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its pacifist theme. D. L. Kershen wrote \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails\".<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997).

Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield. Does ''Breaker Morant'' demonstrate what happens when due process is not observed?<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~pyle/pla4020/Breaker.html \"Breaker Morant\"] on the [[University of Central Florida]] website Retrieved 24 July 2009</ref>}}\n\nBruce Beresford claimed the film is often misunderstood as the story of men [[kangaroo court|railroaded]] by the British,\n\n{{quote|But that's not what it's about at all. The film never pretended for a moment that they weren't guilty. It said they were guilty.

It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.<ref name=\"bruce\"/>}}\n\nAfter the success of ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford was offered dozens of Hollywood scripts including ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', which he later directed. The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' (1989) which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially,\n\n{{quote|Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years.

He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]) and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]])\u2014have been arrested and charged with the murder of captured [[Boer]]s and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the German Emperor\u2014[[Wilhelm II]]\u2014has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nThe defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Morant, Handcock and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which look bad. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy\".\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Morant and Handcock are charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese]].\n\nBolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Thomas manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Morant's friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat. When the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with many losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nThomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Thomas and his clients, Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the calibre of his rifle, \"Rule 303\". That night, Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nTaylor testifies that Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Colonel [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners. According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nThomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Bolton privately tells Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Thomas not to insist. In private Kitchener tells Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the British Army. He orders Hamilton to testify in his place and when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do\".\n\nThe following day, Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Denny comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Thomas explains that Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese. A Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Heese, with a rifle. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nOn stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons\". When Morant had confronted the Heese, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot dead, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting\".\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge\". At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts. The following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Bolton eyes him, Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me\". To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, even missionaries. That is why, after Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Heese. They celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]] but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]] and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it\". Next morning, the defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation and finds that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that London and the Australian Government support the verdict and sentences. There now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]]. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]] but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He says that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the war. This, Kitchener explains, is why Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all costs.\n\nAccording to the South African historian Charles Leach, the legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels\". \"No personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case\". Questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/> The scene contains a kernel of truth. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Morant, Handcock and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013107.</ref>\n* Major Robert Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make\". Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of other ranks and Colonel Hall===\nThe soldiers from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Morant, Handcock and Witton are depicted as motivated by grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corporal Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness and other offences. All are portrayed with British accents.\n\nHall the officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]] is depicted as fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favourable to the defence. Surviving documents tell that the arrest of the six defendants was ''ordered'' by Hall after a letter from the other ranks at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]] and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98\u2013101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\" but their arrests took place elsewhere. After the letter Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to kill the defendants. According to the Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124\u2013125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to the South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Captain Hunt===\nIn the film, Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to the South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\". A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him on screen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its pacifist theme. D. L. Kershen wrote \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails\".<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997).

Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield.

The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' (1989) which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially,\n\n{{quote|Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years.

Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Signature Studios]], they were to be set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]].\n\nFollowing the cancellation of all [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], Hulu ordered a set of interconnected new series from Marvel based on fear-focused Marvel properties in May 2019. Labelled \"Adventure into Fear\", the series included ''Ghost Rider''\u2014starring [[Gabriel Luna]], reprising his role from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\u2014and ''Helstrom'', though ''Ghost Rider'' was dropped during development. ''Helstrom'' stars [[Tom Austen]] and Sydney Lemmon, and is set to debut in 2020. Several more series were in development for the banner, but Marvel Television stopped work on these when it was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019.\n\n==Development==\nIn May 2019, after all of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]] were cancelled by that service, [[Marvel Television]] announced that two new series based on [[Ghost Rider]] and the siblings [[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Ana Helstrom]] had been ordered straight-to-series by Hulu, which had recently become majority-controlled by Marvel's parent company [[Disney]]. The intention was to build an interconnected universe between the two series in a similar fashion to the world created for Marvel's Netflix shows,<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" /> while telling standalone stories that fit within the wider MCU.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderCNBC\" /> A series based on Ghost Rider had been rumored at Marvel Television since the character appeared on their [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', but the company did not want to make a spin-off series for the character at ABC because they wanted the series to be more mature than that network would allow; Hulu's series ''[[Castle Rock (TV series)|Castle Rock]]'' is closer to the tone that Marvel intended for ''Ghost Rider'', so the studio began discussions with Hulu about expanding their slate at the service beyond the [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> Marvel initially referred to the two series as the cornerstone of the \"Spirits of Vengeance\", with Loeb adding that they were moving into a new, \"chilling\" corner of the Marvel Universe.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderMarvel\" />\n\nLoeb said in August that he saw the Hulu series as Marvel Television \"arising again\" after the Netflix cancellations. He explained that discussions with Hulu regarding ''Ghost Rider'' had expanded to \"three or four shows\" that could be put together in a similar model to the Netflix series, and Marvel was now referring to these collectively as \"Adventure into Fear\". Loeb said this was not another name for \"Marvel Horror\" as Marvel was not interested in making horror series in the vein of the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], instead wanting to focus on heroes who were feared by others.

Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Signature Studios]], they were to be set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]].\n\nFollowing the cancellation of all [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], Hulu ordered a set of interconnected new series from Marvel based on fear-focused Marvel properties in May 2019. Labelled \"Adventure into Fear\", the series included ''Ghost Rider''\u2014starring [[Gabriel Luna]], reprising his role from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''\u2014and ''Helstrom'', though ''Ghost Rider'' was dropped during development. ''Helstrom'' stars [[Tom Austen]] and Sydney Lemmon, and is set to debut in 2020. Several more series were in development for the banner, but Marvel Television stopped work on these when it was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019.\n\n==Development==\nIn May 2019, after all of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]] were cancelled by that service, [[Marvel Television]] announced that two new series based on [[Ghost Rider]] and the siblings [[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Ana Helstrom]] had been ordered straight-to-series by Hulu, which had recently become majority-controlled by Marvel's parent company [[Disney]]. The intention was to build an interconnected universe between the two series in a similar fashion to the world created for Marvel's Netflix shows,<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" /> while telling standalone stories that fit within the wider MCU.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderCNBC\" /> A series based on Ghost Rider had been rumored at Marvel Television since the character appeared on their [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', but the company did not want to make a spin-off series for the character at ABC because they wanted the series to be more mature than that network would allow; Hulu's series ''[[Castle Rock (TV series)|Castle Rock]]'' is closer to the tone that Marvel intended for ''Ghost Rider'', so the studio began discussions with Hulu about expanding their slate at the service beyond the [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> Marvel initially referred to the two series as the cornerstone of the \"Spirits of Vengeance\", with Loeb adding that they were moving into a new, \"chilling\" corner of the Marvel Universe.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderMarvel\" />\n\nLoeb said in August that he saw the Hulu series as Marvel Television \"arising again\" after the Netflix cancellations. He explained that discussions with Hulu regarding ''Ghost Rider'' had expanded to \"three or four shows\" that could be put together in a similar model to the Netflix series, and Marvel was now referring to these collectively as \"Adventure into Fear\". Loeb said this was not another name for \"Marvel Horror\" as Marvel was not interested in making horror series in the vein of the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], instead wanting to focus on heroes who were feared by others. He added that further series under this banner beyond ''Ghost Rider'' and ''Helstrom'' were in development.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> A month later, Hulu decided to no longer move forward with ''Ghost Rider'' due to creative differences, though ''Helstrom'' was still planned to go ahead.<ref name=\"GRCanceled\" /> When production began on ''Helstrom'' in October, Loeb reiterated that it was just the first series of the \"Adventure into Fear\" franchise.<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" /> However, Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]] in December 2019 and stopped development on all new projects. Some Marvel Television executives moved to Marvel Studios to oversee the completion of ''Helstrom'' and other series that were already in production.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />\n\n==Series==\n<section begin=TVSeriesTable />\n{{Series overview\n| released    = y\n| infoA       = [[Showrunner]]\n| infoB       = Status\n| width       = 99%\n| multiseries = y\n| network     = y\n| dontclose   = y\n}}\n<section begin=Fear />\n{{Series overview\n| series      = ''[[Helstrom (TV series)|Helstrom]]''{{efn|name=Marvel Studios|Production of ''Helstrom'' was moved to Marvel Studios following the shut down of Marvel Television, with executives from Marvel Television staying on to supervise the completion of the series.<ref name=\"MarvelTVFolded\" />|group=lower-alpha}}\n| infoA       = y\n| infoB       = y\n\n| color1      = #B41900\n| linkR1      = <ref name=\"HuluGRH\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ghost-rider-helstrom-marvel-live-action-dramas-a-go-at-hulu-1206336 |title='Ghost Rider,' 'Helstrom' Marvel Live-Action Dramas a Go at Hulu |last=Goldberg |first=Leslie |date=May 1, 2019 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/78926jUES?url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ghost-rider-helstrom-marvel-live-action-dramas-a-go-at-hulu-1206336 |archive-date=May 5, 2019 |access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| episodes1   = 10<ref name=\"HelstromCast\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/helstrom-cast-marvel-series-elizabeth-marvel-tom-austen-sydney-lemmon-hulu-1202755045/ |title='Marvel's Helstrom' Cast Revealed With 'Homeland', 'Fear The Walking Dead' & 'The Royals' Alums For Fiery Hulu Series |last=Patten |first=Dominic |date=October 8, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009085550/https://deadline.com/2019/10/helstrom-cast-marvel-series-elizabeth-marvel-tom-austen-sydney-lemmon-hulu-1202755045/ |archive-date=October 9, 2019 |access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n| start1      = 2020<ref name=\"HuluGRH\" />\n| network1    = [[Hulu]]\n| infoA1      = [[Paul Zbyszewski]]<ref name=\"HuluGRH\" />\n| infoB1      = Awaiting release\n}}\n<section end=Fear />\n</table>\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n<section end=TVSeriesTable />\n=== ''Helstrom'' ===\n[[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Ana Helstrom]], the children of a powerful serial killer, hunt down the worst of humanity.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" />\n\nHulu ordered ''Helstrom'', based on the characters Daimon and Satana Hellstrom, for a 10-episode series in May 2019.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" /><ref name=\"HelstromCast\" /> [[Paul Zbyszewski]] was set as showrunner and executive producer alongside Loeb.<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" /> The series cast, headlined by [[Tom Austen]] and Sydney Lemmon respectively as Daimon and Ana Helstrom, was announced in early October with the start of production in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" /> Filming wrapped in March 2020.<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors}}\n{{Cast indicator|appeared=in the series in starring roles|media=series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=50%\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"70%\" | ''Helstrom''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]]\n| [[Robert Wisdom]]<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Louise Hastings\n| June Carryl<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Ana Helstrom]]\n| Sydney Lemmon<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon Helstrom]]\n| [[Tom Austen]]<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Victoria Helstrom\n| [[Elizabeth Marvel]]<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gabriella Rossetti\n| Ariana Guerra<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Chris Yen\n| Alain Uy<ref name=\"HelstromCast\" />\n|-\n|}\n<!--\n==Reception==\n{{hatnote|For more details on the reception of each series, see the \"Reception\" section on each series' article.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n| ''Helstrom''\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#b41900;\"|\n| [[Helstrom (TV series)#Critical response|1]]\n| {{N/A|TBA}}\n| {{N/A|TBA}}\n|-\n|}\n-->\n==Abandoned projects==\n{{See also|List of unproduced television projects based on Marvel Comics}}\n\n===''Ghost Rider''===\nOn the Texas\u2013Mexico border, Robbie Reyes avenges the innocent by unleashing the demonic [[Ghost Rider]].<ref name=\"GRHSeriesOrderTHR\" />\n\nDuring development on the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
