SINEs are also implicated in certain types of genetic disease in humans and other [[eukaryotes]].\n\nIn essence, short interspersed nuclear elements are genetic parasites which have evolved very early in the history of eukaryotes to utilize protein machinery within the organism as well as to co-opt the machinery from similarly parasitic genomic elements. The simplicity of these elements make them incredibly successful at persisting and amplifying (through retrotransposition)  within the genomes of eukaryotes. These \u201cparasites\u201d which have become ubiquitous in genomes can be very deleterious to organisms as discussed below. However, eukaryotes have been able to integrate short-interspersed nuclear elements into different signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathways and have become a great source of genetic variability. They seem to play a particularly important role in the regulation of [[gene expression]] and the creation of RNA genes. This regulation extends to [[chromatin]] re-organization and the regulation of genomic architecture; furthermore, the different lineages, mutations, and activity among eukaryotes make short-interspersed nuclear elements an incredible useful tool in phylogenetic analysis.\n{{TOC right}}\n==Classification and structure==\nSINEs are classified as non-LTR [[retrotransposons]] because they do not contain [[Long terminal repeat|long terminal repeats (LTRs)]].<ref name=\"Hancks_2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hancks DC, Kazazian HH | title = Active human retrotransposons: variation and disease | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics & Development | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 191\u2013203 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22406018 | pmc = 3376660 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2012.02.006 }}</ref> There are three types of SINEs common to vertebrates and invertebrates: CORE-SINEs, V-SINEs, and AmnSINEs.<ref name=\"Sun_2006\" /> SINEs have 50-500 base pair internal regions which contain a tRNA-derived segment with A and B boxes that serve as an internal promoter for [[RNA polymerase III]].<ref name=\"Wicker2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | display-authors = 6 | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

For example, long non-coding RNA can directly interact with transcriptional repressors and activators, attenuating or modifying their function.<ref name=\"Goodrich_2006\" />  This type of regulation can occur in different ways: the RNA transcript can directly bind to the transcription factor as a co-regulator; also, the RNA can regulate and modify the ability of co-regulators to associate with the transcription factor.<ref name=\"Goodrich_2006\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodrich JA, Kugel JF | title = Non-coding-RNA regulators of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Nature Reviews.

This is especially true for short-interspersed nuclear elements as seen in Usmanova et al.

This is specifically demonstrated by a detailed analysis of over 20 rodent species profiled LINEs and SINEs, mainly L1\u2019s and B1\u2019s respectively; these are families of LINEs and SINEs found at high frequencies in rodents along with other mammals.<ref name=\"Rinehart_2005\" /> The study sought to provide phylogenetic clarity within the context of LINE and SINE activity.\n\nThe study arrived at a candidate taxa believed to be the first instance of L1 LINE extinction; it expectedly discovered that there was no evidence to suggest that B1 SINE activity occurred in species which did not have L1 LINE activity.<ref name=\"Rinehart_2005\" /> Also, the study suggested that B1 short-interspersed nuclear element silencing in fact occurred before L1 long-interspersed nuclear element extinction; this is due to the fact that B1 SINEs are silenced in the genus most-closely related to the genus which does not contain active L1 LINEs (though the genus with B1 SINE silencing still contains active L1 LINEs).<ref name=\"Rinehart_2005\" />  Another genus was also found which similarly contained active L1 long-interspersed nuclear elements but did not contain B1 short-interspersed nuclear elements; the opposite scenario, in which active B1 SINEs were present in a genus which did not possess active L1 LINEs was not found.<ref name=\"Rinehart_2005\" /> This result was expected and strongly supports the theory that SINEs have evolved to co-opt the RNA-binding proteins, endonucleases, and reverse-transcriptases coded by LINEs.

In essence, short-interspersed nuclear elements have become deeply integrated in countless regulatory, metabolic and signaling pathways and thus play an inevitable role in causing disease. Much is still to be known about these genomic parasites but it is clear they play a significant role within eukaryotic organisms.\n\n==SINEs & Pseudogenes==\nThe activity of SINEs however has genetic vestiges which do not seem to play a significant role, positive or negative, and manifest themselves in the genome as [[pseudogene|pseudogenes]].  SINEs however should not be mistaken as RNA pseudogenes.<ref name=\"Vassetzky_2013\" /> In general, pseudogenes are generated when processed mRNAs of protein-coding genes are reverse-transcribed and incorporated back into the genome (RNA pseudogenes are reverse transcribed RNA genes).<ref name=\"Vanin_1985\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanin EF | title = Processed pseudogenes: characteristics and evolution | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 19 | issue =  | pages = 253\u201372 | date = 1985 | pmid = 3909943 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ge.19.120185.001345 }}</ref> Pseudogenes are generally functionless as they descend from processed RNAs independent of their evolutionary-context which includes introns and different regulatory elements which enable transcription and processing. These pseudogenes, though non-functional may in some cases still possess promoters, CpG islands, and other features which enable transcription; they thus can still be transcribed and may possess a role in the regulation of gene expression (like SINEs and other non-coding elements).<ref name=\"Vanin_1985\" />  Pseudogenes thus differ from SINEs in that they are derived from transcribed- functional RNA whereas SINEs are DNA elements which retrotranspose by co-opting RNA genes transcriptional machinery. However, there are studies which suggest  that retro-transposable elements such as short-interspersed nuclear elements are not only capable of copying themselves in alternate regions in the genome but are also able to do so for random genes too.<ref name=\"pmid12897783\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dewannieux M, Esnault C, Heidmann T | title = LINE-mediated retrotransposition of marked Alu sequences | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u20138 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12897783 | doi = 10.1038/ng1223 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15531153\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jurka J | title = Evolutionary impact of human Alu repetitive elements | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics & Development | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 603\u20138 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15531153 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2004.08.008 }}</ref>  Thus SINEs can be playing a vital role in the generation of pseudogenes, which themselves are known to be involved in regulatory networks.

In the penultimate episode, Steven's stress builds up to the point that he becomes a monster and attacks his hometown of Beach City, until the unconditional emotional support of his loved ones brings him back to normal. In the finale, Steven finally decides to leave Beach City, but he worries that [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]], [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] won't miss him after his departure. \n\n== Plot ==\nSteven is on the beach doing a workout when Connie and Lion come in. She asks Steven if he wants to do one last routine before he moves out. Steven and Connie are in Steven's bedroom and are planning Steven's schedule. Connie asks him how everyone took the news about Steven moving out. He basically told everyone in Beach City, and his dad, but he hasn't told the Gems yet. He doesn't have any idea how they are going to take it because the Gems have been so protective of him since his meltdown. He wonders if there's a way he could let them down easy.\n\nLater that day, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl return from the Warp Pad and they see Steven waiting for them. He then shows the Gems his homemade Cookie Cats, and the Gems eat some, including Pearl. The Gems reprise the Cookie Cat song Steven sang to them years ago, singing the song themselves (but ending on ''\"He left his family behind\"''). Steven compares his abandonment of everyone else to Cookie Cat, thinking the reason he left was to move forward in life, despite how difficult it was. He then quickly announces to the Gems, with hesitation, that he's decided to move out the next day, and has a plan of how he's able to visit his friends before he can decide where he wants to go and urges the Gems not to talk him out of his decision. However, the Gems seem to take his decision very lightly and are proud of him showing a desire to be independent. \u00a0\n\nSteven goes to Little Homeworld, where Bismuth, Lapis, and Peridot do not take the news of Steven's departure so lightly. Bismuth begs him not to leave them, and Lapis tries to assure him that running elsewhere will result in what she went through in her past. Peridot bursts out crying, showing how she doesn't want Steven to leave and that there won't be anyone else like him. To commemorate everything they've been through, Steven hands out gifts for everyone to remember him. He gives Peridot his old salmon-pink shirt from the original series, a drawing kit with watercolors for Lapis, and Bismuth gets Rose's Battle Flag since she was one of the very first Crystal Gems. They all hug him while crying, thanking him for all he's done for them, even Steven bursts into tears saying that he loves them, as they reply the same.\n\nBefore heading back to pack his things, Steven encounters Jasper, who appears by punching a hole in the wall. \u00a0She has heard about him leaving and insists that she's coming with him, but he says to her that he will move on alone, and can protect himself. Jasper punches another hole after saying to Steven ''\"Farewell, my Diamond.\"'', proving that even she is also upset about him leaving. Steven heads back to the Temple and gives Amethyst his old video games. She is touched at first but appears to be excited to play his games, which isn't what Steven was expecting. He then goes outside to give Pearl his old ukulele, and she nonchalantly stores it in her gemstone. Steven says it's okay for Pearl to be sad, but she replies that him leaving is a positive thing as he's going to explore new places.\n\nSteven holds back his tears as he goes to visit Garnet, giving her the same wedding plan book he used to plan Ruby and Sapphire's wedding, in the hopes that Garnet can eventually help Steven plan his own wedding when the time should come. As she takes it, not showing a lot of emotion, Steven tries to reason with her about how she should feel about his leaving, but Garnet reassures him that he'll be fine. She says that even with her future vision, it's up to him to figure out what to do when he leaves. As she warps away, he weeps.\n\nSteven has all of his things packed up, but he's a little upset over the fact that though the Gems know he's leaving, he didn't get the reaction he was expecting. Greg tells him that they still love him, and are probably trying to be supportive. Steven's gift to Greg is his old room and a wall poster of Kerry Moonbeam, stating that he is now able to move in with the Gems. Laying down on the bed, Greg appreciates this gift, stating how he finally getting some well-deserved rest, and Steven departing is similar to his own childhood. Outside the Temple, Steven says his goodbyes to Connie and Greg, heading for the bed and breakfast, with Connie reminding him to give her a text so he doesn't forget to have breakfast with her. Afterward, he says goodbye to the Gems, who are still smiling their happy faces, and each of them gives Steven a goodbye hug.\n\nAs Steven heads off in the Dondai, driving off to his next destination, he looks at his mirror, watching his family and Connie waving goodbye to him until he can't see them anymore. He then halts the car and quickly drives it in reverse to where the Gems are, and bursts into tears, asking why the Gems are taking the situation so lightly. However, the Gems revealed that they were holding back their tears, and are extremely sad about Steven leaving. They all come crying together for a group hug and said they didn't want their sad thoughts to interfere with him leaving, but whatever happens in his future, they're a part of it too. Everyone stating they love each other, they give Steven one more goodbye, and he leaves his old home to a new path in his future. Steven passes by the Big Donut, where everyone waves goodbye to him as he leaves Beach City, beginning his road trip, ending the episode, the series, and the entire ''Steven Universe'' franchise overall. \n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Viewership ===\nThe episode was watched by 0.74 million people.<ref name=\"FinalEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-27-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.27.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> \n\n== Future ==\nWhile Rebecca Sugar has confirmed that this is the series finale and that there is no continuation in development, nor any ongoing projects, she has hinted that possible future stories exist. \"The story is continuing off screen and I do know what happens next...But I would have to decide how and when I'd want to dig into that, or if it's best to give them their privacy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/27/21197679/steven-universe-future-ending-finale-new-seasons-rebecca-sugar-interview|title=The reason Rebecca Sugar made Steven Universe Future, and why it\u2019s the actual end|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|date=March 27, 2020|website=Polygon|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSugar later told ''[[Fast Company]]'' \"I'm certainly interested in spending more time in this world with these characters.

In 1991 Watkins was inducted as a Fellow into the International Textile and Apparel Association (ITAA), the highest honor awarded by the organization, for her contributions in shaping the field of functional apparel design.\n\n==Biography==\n\nWatkins was born on June 12, 1943, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Her grandmother taught her how to sew on a treadle sewing machine. After graduating from Central Dauphin High School, in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], she pursued clothing design as her profession with the goal of teaching at the university level.\n\nShe received her B.S. in 1965 and her M.S. in 1967 from [[Pennsylvania State University]] in Textiles and Clothing, with a focus on the social and psychological aspects of clothing. In 2014, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the [[University of Minnesota]] in recognition for establishing the field of functional apparel design and for her continuing contributions to the field.<ref name=minnesota /><ref>Watkins Earns Honorary Doctoral Degree, HE Alumni Briefs, Link  Magazine: The Magazine for Human Ecology Alumni, Cornell University, Spring, 2014. [https://issuu.com/humec_comm/docs/linkspring2014/5?e=5110236/7510133]</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\n\nWatkins was a faculty member and researcher at Cornell University from 1967 to 1998, attaining the rank of Professor in the  [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]]  in 1987, and is currently an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Fiber Science & Apparel Design.<ref name=minnesota />\nShe spent time in residence as a visiting professor at [[Oregon State University]], the University of Minnesota, [[Kansas State University]], and [[Seattle Pacific University]].\n\n==Development of the Functional Design Program==\nWatkins\u2019s work at Cornell focused on training apparel designers to understand and create garments designed primarily to function well for workers needing protection, for athletes, and for the military.\n\nWatkins organized collaborations with apparel companies for her students and discussed the theory and process of apparel design with academic colleagues and industry partners. These projects played a significant role in shifting the focus in the curriculum at the Department of Textiles and Clothing from preparing young women for work in the home, managing a family, toward preparing them to work in the apparel industry.\n\nIn the late 1960s Watkins came in contact with Dr. Stephen J. Kennedy,  then director of what is now the United States Army Soldier Systems Center. He gave a presentation at Cornell University in which he described the challenges involved in developing uniforms and protective clothing for soldiers. He could not find people with expertise in the area of apparel design to hire so instead hired engineers and trained them in clothing design after they had joined the army research lab. He said that it took him 12 or 13 years to retrain engineers to be effective designers of clothing that functioned well for soldiers.\n\nBecause no university had a program yet that focused on functional apparel design, Watkins worked with the army to identify the skills and knowledge required for a designer to fill this need; she then led the development of a program at Cornell University that would instruct apparel students in functional design by incorporating principles of science and engineering into a curriculum grounded in a thorough understanding of the design process.<ref>College of Design, University of Minnesota, May 27, 2014, Susan Watkins Receives Honorary Degree. [http://designatmnblog.com/2014/05/susan-watkins-receives-honorar-1/]</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 80s, Watkins spoke extensively about the critical need for research and education in functional apparel design to other universities and industry associations, including an influential presentation at a 1989 conference of the Association of College Professors of Textiles and Clothing (ACPTC) (now the [[International Textile and Apparel Association]] (ITAA).<ref name=EHE /> The ITAA has since actively supported research, teaching, design, and design exhibition of functional apparel.\n\n==''Clothing: The Portable Environment''==\n\nIn 1984, Watkins published [http://amzn.com/0813803160 ''Clothing: The Portable Environment''], which has become the foremost textbook for functional apparel design courses and programs and serves as a valued resource for professional designers. Her multidisciplinary, theory-based approach to creating or improving designs is used in apparel programs across the United States and abroad.  A second edition was published in 1995.<ref>Book: Tech makes clothing a 'portable environment', 1995, Lang, S., Cornell Chronicle, November 2nd. [https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/25579/027_11.pdf#page=6]</ref> Both editions have been translated into Japanese and Korean.\n\nIn describing Watkins\u2019s contribution to the textile and apparel design fields through her curriculum development and textbook, author and North Carolina State University professor Kate Carroll notes that \"a thorough background in mechanics, body structures, the properties of materials, basic psychology, and assessment of visual appeal\u201d is necessary for the design of functional apparel, in contrast to that of \u201cready-to-wear goods, where most consumers buy a product for its looks rather than for a special function.\"<ref>Carroll, Kate. \"Disability, Its Effect on the Body, and the Clothing Perspective.\" The Berg Fashion Library. [http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com/view/bewdf/BEWDF-v10/EDch10712.xml]</ref>\n\nBraddock and O'Mahony also acknowledge Susan Watkins contribution in the 1996 edition of ''Techno Textiles'' stating that her characterization of clothing as our most intimate environment is an important part of survival today, as functional garments have developed to the point where they maintain an active rather than a passive relationship with the body, a relationship that was predicted in the first edition of ''Clothing: The Portable Environment''.\n\nIn January 2015, Watkins and co-author Lucy Dunne published a new book, ''Functional Clothing Design: From Sportswear to Spacesuits''<ref>[https://issuu.com/humec_comm/docs/hemag_spring2015/41?e=5110236/5957654 Cornell Human Ecology Magazine, 2015]</ref>\n\n==Pedagogical influence==\n\nWatkins\u2019s development of teaching methodologies, courses, and projects for graduate and undergraduate students on the topic of functional apparel design took place in conjunction with her research and consulting projects with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, firefighters associations, and many industrial partners. She arranged collaborations between students and industry personnel to advance students\u2019 education and hands-on experience while benefiting industry and wearers of protective clothing. These projects are further detailed in her 1988 publication \"Using the Design Process to Teach Functional Apparel Design\".<ref>Using the Design Process to Teach Functional Apparel Design (Watkins, S., Clothing and Textiles Research Journal) September 1988 Vol. 7 No. 1 10\u201314 [http://ctr.sagepub.com/content/7/1/10.abstract]</ref>\n\n==Retirement activities==\n\nFollowing her retirement from Cornell in 1998, Watkins continues to work as a consultant and designer, conducting workshops for both industry and academia, reviewing submissions for peer-reviewed journals, and participating in invited lectures at engineering schools and conferences in the emerging field of wearable technology. She is currently designer and manager of Portable Environments, LLC, a consulting firm for functional design.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n* Watkins, S. M. (1977).

In 1991 Watkins was inducted as a Fellow into the International Textile and Apparel Association (ITAA), the highest honor awarded by the organization, for her contributions in shaping the field of functional apparel design.\n\n==Biography==\n\nWatkins was born on June 12, 1943, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Her grandmother taught her how to sew on a treadle sewing machine. After graduating from Central Dauphin High School, in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], she pursued clothing design as her profession with the goal of teaching at the university level.\n\nShe received her B.S. in 1965 and her M.S. in 1967 from [[Pennsylvania State University]] in Textiles and Clothing, with a focus on the social and psychological aspects of clothing. In 2014, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the [[University of Minnesota]] in recognition for establishing the field of functional apparel design and for her continuing contributions to the field.<ref name=minnesota /><ref>Watkins Earns Honorary Doctoral Degree, HE Alumni Briefs, Link  Magazine: The Magazine for Human Ecology Alumni, Cornell University, Spring, 2014. [https://issuu.com/humec_comm/docs/linkspring2014/5?e=5110236/7510133]</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\n\nWatkins was a faculty member and researcher at Cornell University from 1967 to 1998, attaining the rank of Professor in the  [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]]  in 1987, and is currently an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Fiber Science & Apparel Design.<ref name=minnesota />\nShe spent time in residence as a visiting professor at [[Oregon State University]], the University of Minnesota, [[Kansas State University]], and [[Seattle Pacific University]].\n\n==Development of the Functional Design Program==\nWatkins\u2019s work at Cornell focused on training apparel designers to understand and create garments designed primarily to function well for workers needing protection, for athletes, and for the military.\n\nWatkins organized collaborations with apparel companies for her students and discussed the theory and process of apparel design with academic colleagues and industry partners. These projects played a significant role in shifting the focus in the curriculum at the Department of Textiles and Clothing from preparing young women for work in the home, managing a family, toward preparing them to work in the apparel industry.\n\nIn the late 1960s Watkins came in contact with Dr. Stephen J. Kennedy,  then director of what is now the United States Army Soldier Systems Center. He gave a presentation at Cornell University in which he described the challenges involved in developing uniforms and protective clothing for soldiers. He could not find people with expertise in the area of apparel design to hire so instead hired engineers and trained them in clothing design after they had joined the army research lab. He said that it took him 12 or 13 years to retrain engineers to be effective designers of clothing that functioned well for soldiers.\n\nBecause no university had a program yet that focused on functional apparel design, Watkins worked with the army to identify the skills and knowledge required for a designer to fill this need; she then led the development of a program at Cornell University that would instruct apparel students in functional design by incorporating principles of science and engineering into a curriculum grounded in a thorough understanding of the design process.<ref>College of Design, University of Minnesota, May 27, 2014, Susan Watkins Receives Honorary Degree. [http://designatmnblog.com/2014/05/susan-watkins-receives-honorar-1/]</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 80s, Watkins spoke extensively about the critical need for research and education in functional apparel design to other universities and industry associations, including an influential presentation at a 1989 conference of the Association of College Professors of Textiles and Clothing (ACPTC) (now the [[International Textile and Apparel Association]] (ITAA).<ref name=EHE /> The ITAA has since actively supported research, teaching, design, and design exhibition of functional apparel.\n\n==''Clothing: The Portable Environment''==\n\nIn 1984, Watkins published [http://amzn.com/0813803160 ''Clothing: The Portable Environment''], which has become the foremost textbook for functional apparel design courses and programs and serves as a valued resource for professional designers. Her multidisciplinary, theory-based approach to creating or improving designs is used in apparel programs across the United States and abroad.  A second edition was published in 1995.<ref>Book: Tech makes clothing a 'portable environment', 1995, Lang, S., Cornell Chronicle, November 2nd. [https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/25579/027_11.pdf#page=6]</ref> Both editions have been translated into Japanese and Korean.\n\nIn describing Watkins\u2019s contribution to the textile and apparel design fields through her curriculum development and textbook, author and North Carolina State University professor Kate Carroll notes that \"a thorough background in mechanics, body structures, the properties of materials, basic psychology, and assessment of visual appeal\u201d is necessary for the design of functional apparel, in contrast to that of \u201cready-to-wear goods, where most consumers buy a product for its looks rather than for a special function.\"<ref>Carroll, Kate. \"Disability, Its Effect on the Body, and the Clothing Perspective.\" The Berg Fashion Library. [http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com/view/bewdf/BEWDF-v10/EDch10712.xml]</ref>\n\nBraddock and O'Mahony also acknowledge Susan Watkins contribution in the 1996 edition of ''Techno Textiles'' stating that her characterization of clothing as our most intimate environment is an important part of survival today, as functional garments have developed to the point where they maintain an active rather than a passive relationship with the body, a relationship that was predicted in the first edition of ''Clothing: The Portable Environment''.\n\nIn January 2015, Watkins and co-author Lucy Dunne published a new book, ''Functional Clothing Design: From Sportswear to Spacesuits''<ref>[https://issuu.com/humec_comm/docs/hemag_spring2015/41?e=5110236/5957654 Cornell Human Ecology Magazine, 2015]</ref>\n\n==Pedagogical influence==\n\nWatkins\u2019s development of teaching methodologies, courses, and projects for graduate and undergraduate students on the topic of functional apparel design took place in conjunction with her research and consulting projects with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, firefighters associations, and many industrial partners. She arranged collaborations between students and industry personnel to advance students\u2019 education and hands-on experience while benefiting industry and wearers of protective clothing. These projects are further detailed in her 1988 publication \"Using the Design Process to Teach Functional Apparel Design\".<ref>Using the Design Process to Teach Functional Apparel Design (Watkins, S., Clothing and Textiles Research Journal) September 1988 Vol. 7 No. 1 10-14 [http://ctr.sagepub.com/content/7/1/10.abstract]</ref>\n\n==Retirement activities==\n\nFollowing her retirement from Cornell in 1998, Watkins continues to work as a consultant and designer, conducting workshops for both industry and academia, reviewing submissions for peer-reviewed journals, and participating in invited lectures at engineering schools and conferences in the emerging field of wearable technology. She is currently designer and manager of Portable Environments, LLC, a consulting firm for functional design.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n* Watkins, S. M. (1977).

The soundtracks were composed by Ajit Singh.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a young couple Raja and Rita driving through a dense forest at night. Tired and sleepy, they decide to stop for the night, and find a ''haveli'' (mansion) nearby. They fall asleep in the outskirts of the mansion. Around midnight, the husband awakes all of a sudden and gets up to investigate. Then a horrible monster attacks him. His wife wakes up hearing him scream and they are both killed by the monster. An old man Narendra suddenly appears, a bit too late but eventually traps the monster in an underground cage and attaches a cross to the latch to keep him from escaping.\n\nThe story then shifts to the lives of Kumar, an industrialist who lives with his wife Seema and niece Anita. Since her parents death, Anita has been living with her uncle who is also the legal custodian of her father's estate. Seema wants Anita to marry her brother Vikram so that they can milk out the estate but Anita does not approve of Vikram and is in love with a photographer named Sunil. Kumar visits the mansion with an agent to buy the building but both of them are killed by the monster. A large group of some twenty-three folks go to the mansion for an outing. Things get interesting when one of Vikram's friends is killed by the iron statue. Many interesting things happen in due course. Seema and Vikram get increasingly frustrated; Anita is about to come of age and reclaim her estate, and Vikram remains unsuccessful at wooing her. Seema hatches a plot and she lures Sunil into the tehkhana (dungeon) where Vikram is waiting for both of them and attacks Sunil from behind. He becomes unconscious and then they lock up the dungeon and leave Sunil there thinking that he will eventually die and Anita may eventually agree to wed Vikram.\n\nSunil recovers in the dungeon and wanders around till he hears the monster from his cage. He is about to open the cage when the old man suddenly appears and stops him from doing so. He leads Sunil out of the dungeon tells him the story of his life and the monster. The old man reveals that twenty years ago he had arrived there from the city since his wife had undergone labour pains and it was necessary for her to deliver the baby and hence he ended up at the mansion for help. However he was repeatedly warned by a nun to go away and not let the delivery happen there because according to her, there was something extremely inhuman and unholy lurking within the mansion and if the delivery took place then that would eventually lead to the birth of Evil. Owing to the adverse condition of his wife, the man did not pay heed to the nun and his wife gave birth to their baby. However he was shocked when he realized that his wife gave birth to the devil and she died herself in the process and the nun was right. The grief stricken man then locked the monster in the cage with the help of the nun and spent 20 years of his life in the same mansion so as to prevent the monster from hurting anyone. Vikram goes back to the dungeon to check for himself that Sunil is dead. He hears the monster and unknowingly releases him getting himself killed. The monster now free goes on a violent rampage, killing people everywhere. Everybody vacates the mansion at once fleeing by bus. Seema unwisely stays behind, tries to flee from another route and she got caught, raped and killed by monster.\n\nThe monster makes his way to the bus that has broken down by a church and the monster kills two girls and the old man as well. The monster enters the church and is tormented by the impulse of the Almighty. He is finally impaled by a cross and his body set ablaze ending his reign of terror once and for all.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice-President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, [[Radio Uganda]] erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment.

That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain. Dozens of soldiers of the Masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed, rival State Research Bureau agents engaged in a shootout in Kampala, and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{see also|Air campaign of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War}}\n=== First attack ===\n[[File:T-55 skos RB.jpg|thumb|The Ugandan attack included numerous [[Vehicle armour|armoured vehicles]], including [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks (example pictured) ]]\n\nAt dawn on 25 October{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first major attack took place on 22 October.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} Journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that fighting began when the Uganda Army started to shell Bukoba on 27 October.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=2}} }} Tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of Ugandan vehicular activity in Mutukula. Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG. The pilot ejected before his jet crashed and managed to safely return to Uganda.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nMeanwhile, in the area surrounding Bukoba, displaced persons from the town and the border region began gathering. Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, [[Radio Uganda]] erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment.

That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him.

A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain. Dozens of soldiers of the Masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed, rival State Research Bureau agents engaged in a shootout in Kampala, and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{see also|Air campaign of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War}}\n=== First attack ===\n[[File:T-55 skos RB.jpg|thumb|The Ugandan attack included numerous [[Vehicle armour|armoured vehicles]], including [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks (example pictured) ]]\n\nAt dawn on 25 October{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first major attack took place on 22 October.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} Journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that fighting began when the Uganda Army started to shell Bukoba on 27 October.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=2}} }} Tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of Ugandan vehicular activity in Mutukula. Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October. Shortly before its arrival, three MiGs attacked the Bukoba area. Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG. The pilot ejected before his jet crashed and managed to safely return to Uganda.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nMeanwhile, in the area surrounding Bukoba, displaced persons from the town and the border region began gathering. Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

His supporters argued that since he had been denied essential reinforcements from his superiors, his choice to observe and report on the Ugandans' progress was the best course of action. His detractors asserted that he was obligated as a soldier to put up as much resistance as possible to the invasion, despite being heavily outnumbered.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}}\n\nThe invasion came at a time when Tanzania's economy was showing signs of recovery from a severe drought in 1974\u20131975.

Many Ugandans started to hide anti-Amin insurgents, thereby aiding them in sabotaging the Ugandan war effort by destroying railway lines, electricity supply lines, and petrol stations. Confronted with these developments, the Ugandan government resorted to brutal suppression, such as arresting and killing all without proper documents in order to eliminate suspected dissidents.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=228}} Unrest also mounted in the military, as many Ugandan soldiers felt that their commanders had handled the invasion incompetently or had even betrayed them to the Tanzanians, resulting in increasing mistrust among the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Rice|2003|pp=11\u201312}} According to southern Ugandan civilians, hundreds of Ugandan troops deserted from the front at Kagera.{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=129}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Course of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War ===\nIn response to the Ugandan invasion, Tanzania began to rapidly expand its army. Over the course of several weeks, the TPDF grew from less than 40,000 troops to over 150,000, including about 40,000 militiamen.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=27}} Tanzania also mobilised several hundred anti-Amin Ugandan exiles and equipped them to battle the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=72\u201373}} Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond defending Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, he decided that Tanzanian forces should occupy southern Uganda.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=77\u201378}} In February [[Battle of Masaka|Masaka]] and Mbarara were seized by Tanzanian and Ugandan rebel forces and destroyed with explosives in revenge for the destruction caused by the Ugandans in Kagera.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=84\u201385}} Nyerere originally planned to halt his forces and allow the Ugandan rebels to attack Kampala and overthrow Amin, as he feared that scenes of Tanzanian troops occupying the city would reflect poorly on his country's image abroad. However, Ugandan rebel forces did not have the strength to defeat the Libyan units coming to Amin's aid, so Nyerere decided to use the TPDF to take Kampala.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=162\u2013163}} The [[Fall of Kampala|city fell]] on 11 April and Amin was deposed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=160}} The British government supplied Tanzania with several million [[pounds sterling]] during the war to ostensibly assist with repairing the damage in Kagera, though likely with the understanding that the money would be used to fund military efforts.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=104}} [[West Germany]] also gave Tanzania money to assist with the refugees from Kagera.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=76}} As the TPDF secured the rest of the country, they seized the Kilembe Mines.

Most of them could not return to their homes until the early 1980s.{{sfn|Kamazima|2004|p=174}} In 2000, members of Parliament from rural Nkenge and Bukoba constituencies complained that some residents had not returned\u2014due to the continuing presence of unidentified corpses in their homes\u2014or had not achieved a standard of living in parity with that of the pre-war era. The Minister for Home Affairs responded by saying the government would not offer financial assistance to Kagera residents affected by the war as the conflict had been taxing for all Tanzanians and they were not entitled to special compensation.{{sfn|Kamazima|2004|p=171}}\n\n==== Rehabilitation ====\n[[File:Informal Cross-border Trade.jpg|thumb|Ugandan traders moving goods from Tanzania over the Kagera River in 2016]]\nThe Tanzanian government strengthened its presence in Kagera after the war, bolstering its police station in Kyaka and establishing several others in border towns. For security reasons, villagers were prohibited from occupying land within 100 metres of the border, though there was little oversight of this restriction over time and it was sometimes ignored by locals.{{sfn|Kamazima|2004|p=176}} In the immediate aftermath of the war the government shut down cross-border markets, resulting in shortages of goods and spikes in commodity

announced a programme to rehabilitate the Kagera border region with a focus on rebuilding lost infrastructure and promotion of the ''[[Ujamaa]]'' political philosophy.{{sfn|Kamazima|2004|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1982 the Tanzanian Ministry of Information and Culture published a study on the sociocultural and economic impacts of the invasion on the Kagera

The Articles of Confederation [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the states. The  weak [[central government]] established by the Articles received only those powers which the [[Thirteen Colonies|former colonies]] had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\">Morison p. 279</ref>\n\nThe document provided clearly written rules for how the states' \"league of friendship\" would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business, directing the [[American Revolutionary War|war effort]], conducting diplomacy with foreign states, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the ''Continental Congress'', since its organization remained the same.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\"/>\n\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Martin|title=Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?|publisher=About Education|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Rodgers| first = Paul| title = United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&pg=PA109| year = 2011| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-6017-5| page = 109 }}</ref> The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|President]]), courts, and taxing powers.\n\n==Background and context==\nThe political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan]], an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen; others would weaken, especially in the degree of loyalty (or lack thereof) owed the Crown. [[Boston Tea Party|Civil disobedience]] resulted in coercive and quelling measures, such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the [[Intolerable Acts]] in the British Parliament, and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed skirmishes]] which resulted in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]]. These actions eroded the number of Crown Loyalists ([[Tory|Tories]]) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]].\n\nIt was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a \"rulebook\" for how the new nation should function. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued [[fiat money]], created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wood| first = Gordon S.| title = The Creation of the American Republic: 1776\u20131787| url = https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood| url-access = registration| year = 1969| publisher = University of North Carolina Press| pages = [https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood/page/354 354\u201355] }}</ref>\n\nTo transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation,  the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \"manifesto\" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Paine| first = Thomas| editor-last = Foner| editor-first = Eric| editor-link = Eric Foner| title = Paine: Collected Writings| publisher = The Library of America |   isbn = 978-1-4286-2200-5| pages = 45\u20136| chapter = Common Sense| date = January 14, 1776 }} (Collection published 1995.)</ref>\n\nBeyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \"to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty|model treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \"a firm league\" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.<ref>{{Cite journal |author-link= David Armitage (historian) |first= David |last=  Armitage |url= http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full |title= The Declaration of Independence in World Context |publisher= [[Organization of American Historians]] |journal= Magazine of History |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 61\u201366 |year= 2004 |doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.61}}</ref>\n\n==Drafting==\n[[File:Articles of Confederation 13c 1977 issue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.90|alt=Historical 13-cent postage stamp commemorating the Articles of Confederation 200th anniversary|1977 13-cent U.S. [[Postage stamp]] commemorating the Articles of Confederation bicentennial; the draft was completed on November 15, 1777]]\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.

The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation's central  government. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress, which was empowered to make war and peace, negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and to resolve disputes between the states. The document also stipulates that its provisions \"shall be inviolably observed by every state\" and that \"[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]\". \n\nSummary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles:\n# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: \"The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'\"\n# Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government: \"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.\"\n# Declares the purpose of the confederation: \"The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.\"\n# Elaborates upon the intent \"to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,\" and to establish [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding \"[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.\" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.\n# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the \"United States in Congress Assembled\") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years.\n# Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped [[Militia (United States)|militia]].\n# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below.\n# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each.\n# Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled. \n#* Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture|courts for appeals in all cases of captures]], but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.\n#* The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final.\n#* Congress shall regulate the [[post office]]s; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces.\n#* The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress.\n#* Congress may request requisitions (demands for payments or supplies) from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit.\n#* Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a [[commander in chief]] without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months.\n# When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by \"The committee of the states, or any nine of them\", except for those powers of Congress which require nine states ''in'' Congress to execute.\n# If Canada [referring to the British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]] accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp|title=Avalon Project - Articles of Confederation : March 1, 1781|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref> No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states.\n#Affirms that the Confederation will honor all [[Engagements Clause#The precursor in the Articles of Confederation|bills of credit incurred, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by Congress]] before the existence of the Articles.\n# Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures.\n\n==Congress under the Articles==\n\n===The army===\nUnder the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the [[Continental Army]], but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food.<ref>{{cite book| last = Carp| first = E.

The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.<ref>Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165\u2013166. Phelps wrote:\n:\"It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.\"</ref>}}\n\nThe Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.<ref>Puls pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Knox wrote:\n\n{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, \"A hoop to the barrel\" or \"Cement to the Union\".<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\">Puls p. 177</ref>}}\n\nAs Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, \"As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\" />\n\nOnce the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small [[First American Regiment|national force]] was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}</ref>\n\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Keith L. |last= Dougherty |title= An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775\u20131783 |journal= Social Science History |date=  Spring 2009 |volume= 33 |issue= 1 |pages= 47\u201374 |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Confederation Period#Foreign affairs}}\nThe 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a [[quorum]] so that it could be ratified. Afterward, the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time, causing difficulties in raising a [[quorum]]. The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists, including George Washington. Many of the most prominent national leaders, such as Washington, [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]], retired from public life, served as foreign delegates, or held office in state governments; and for the general public, local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory. This served to exacerbate Congress's impotence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferling|first1=John|title=A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic|url=https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl/page/255 255\u2013259]}}</ref>\n\nInherent weaknesses in the confederation's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary pirates]], wrote in a [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|diplomatic correspondence]] to [[James Monroe]] that, \"It will be said there is no money in the treasury.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1954, pp. 560\u2013566]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the 1786 [[Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty]] with [[Spain]] also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty, which was never ratified, the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795, after the federal Constitution came into force.\n\n===Taxation and commerce===\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789| url = https://archive.org/details/newnationhistory0000jens_x8b5/page/177| year = 1950| publisher = Northeastern University Press| isbn = 978-0-930350-14-7| pages = [https://archive.org/details/newnationhistory0000jens_x8b5/page/177 177\u2013233]}}</ref>\n\nCongress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, \"that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.\"<ref>Stahr p. 105</ref> Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were \"the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.\"<ref>Stahr p. 107</ref> He argued that Americans should avoid having it said \"that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent\" or that \"her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.\"<ref>Stahr pp. 107\u2013108</ref> The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.\n\nCongress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.\n\n===Accomplishments===\n{{details|Admission to the Union#Articles of Confederation}}\n{{more footnotes|section|date=January 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the [[admission to the Union|admission of new states]] and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for [[public domain (land)|public use]]. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward\u2014as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sat\u014d| first=Sh\u014dsuke| url=https://archive.org/details/historylandques00satgoog| title=History of the land question in the United States| publisher=Isaac Friedenwald, for [[Johns Hopkins University]]| location=Baltimore, Maryland| date=1886| page=352|orig-year=Digitized 2008| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]].  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866|Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], eventually became the states of: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states.\n\nNo new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as \"Canada\" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin),  [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] to the Union were considered, but none were approved.\n\n===Presidents of Congress===\n{{Further|President of the Continental Congress}}\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the presiding officer of Congress\u2014referred to in many official records as ''President of the United States in Congress Assembled''\u2014chaired the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = 178\u2013179 }}</ref>\n\nThere were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles.

However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786\u201387, [[Shays' Rebellion]], an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Murrin| first1 = John M.| title = Liberty, Equality, Power, A History of the American People: To 1877| year = 2008| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company| isbn = 978-1-111-83086-1| page = 187}}</ref>\n\nThe Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression \"not worth a continental\". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.

Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ferling| first = John| title = John Adams: A Life| year = 2010| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-975273-7| pages = 257\u20138 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.

A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.\n\nThe Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.\n\nOn July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also were unable to sign that day, since their delegations were absent.\n\nAfter the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.\n\nThe other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland [[History of Maryland#The Revolutionary period|refused to ratify]] the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims. [[Anne-C\u00e9sar, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Chevalier de La Luzerne]], French [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] would do what he could but La Luzerne also \u201csharply pressed\u201d Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sioussat |first= St. George L.|date= October 1936 |title= THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE AND THE RATIFICATION OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BY MARYLAND, 1780-1781 With Accompanying Documents|url= https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/28432/28188 |journal= The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume= 60|issue= 4|pages= 391\u2013418 |access-date= April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation, February 2, 1781]]\nOn February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].<ref name=\"lawsofmaryland\">{{cite web |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015508/http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |archivedate= July 23, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states.

At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a \"Grand Convention.\" Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:\n\n{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.<ref>McDonald pg. 276</ref>}}\n\nIn May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.\n\nHistorian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:\n\n{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the \"consolidated government\" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a \"splendid empire\" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ketcham| first = Ralph| title = Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&pg=PA381| year = 1990| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| isbn = 978-0-945612-19-3| page = 383 }}</ref>}}\n\nHistorians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.\n\nRakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures \"stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.\"<ref>Rakove 1988 p. 230</ref> The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new \"merchant state,\" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.<ref>Hendrickson p. 154</ref>\n\n===Legitimacy of closing down===\nPolitical scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"<ref>Hendrickson p. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n\n<blockquote>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\n\n<blockquote>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</blockquote>\n\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\"  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.<ref name=Maier>Maier, Pauline.

The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be \"unadvisable\" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so \"under the Articles of Confederation\" only, but not \"under the Constitution\".<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kesavan| first1=Vasan| title=When Did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law| journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=December 1, 2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3 |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

The Articles of Confederation [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the states. The  weak [[central government]] established by the Articles received only those powers which the [[Thirteen Colonies|former colonies]] had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\">Morison p. 279</ref>\n\nThe document provided clearly written rules for how the states' \"league of friendship\" would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business, directing the [[American Revolutionary War|war effort]], conducting diplomacy with foreign states, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the ''Continental Congress'', since its organization remained the same.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\"/>\n\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Martin|title=Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?|publisher=About Education|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Rodgers| first = Paul| title = United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&pg=PA109| year = 2011| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-6017-5| page = 109 }}</ref> The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|President]]), courts, and taxing powers.\n\n==Background and context==\nThe political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan]], an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen; others would weaken, especially in the degree of loyalty (or lack thereof) owed the Crown. [[Boston Tea Party|Civil disobedience]] resulted in coercive and quelling measures, such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the [[Intolerable Acts]] in the British Parliament, and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed skirmishes]] which resulted in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]]. These actions eroded the number of Crown Loyalists ([[Tory|Tories]]) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]].\n\nIt was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a \"rulebook\" for how the new nation should function. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued [[fiat money]], created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wood| first = Gordon S.| title = The Creation of the American Republic: 1776\u20131787| url = https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood| url-access = registration| year = 1969| publisher = University of North Carolina Press| pages = [https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood/page/354 354\u201355] }}</ref>\n\nTo transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation,  the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \"manifesto\" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Paine| first = Thomas| editor-last = Foner| editor-first = Eric| editor-link = Eric Foner| title = Paine: Collected Writings| publisher = The Library of America |   isbn = 978-1-4286-2200-5| pages = 45\u20136| chapter = Common Sense| date = January 14, 1776 }} (Collection published 1995.)</ref>\n\nBeyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \"to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty|model treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \"a firm league\" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.<ref>{{Cite journal |author-link= David Armitage (historian) |first= David |last=  Armitage |url= http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full |title= The Declaration of Independence in World Context |publisher= [[Organization of American Historians]] |journal= Magazine of History |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 61\u201366 |year= 2004 |doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.61}}</ref>\n\n==Drafting==\n[[File:Articles of Confederation 13c 1977 issue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.90|alt=Historical 13-cent postage stamp commemorating the Articles of Confederation 200th anniversary|1977 13-cent U.S. [[Postage stamp]] commemorating the Articles of Confederation bicentennial; the draft was completed on November 15, 1777]]\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.

The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation's central  government. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress, which was empowered to make war and peace, negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and to resolve disputes between the states. The document also stipulates that its provisions \"shall be inviolably observed by every state\" and that \"[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]\". \n\nSummary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles:\n# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: \"The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'\"\n# Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government: \"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.\"\n# Declares the purpose of the confederation: \"The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.\"\n# Elaborates upon the intent \"to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,\" and to establish [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding \"[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.\" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.\n# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the \"United States in Congress Assembled\") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years.\n# Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped [[Militia (United States)|militia]].\n# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below.\n# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each.\n# Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled. \n#* Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture|courts for appeals in all cases of captures]], but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.\n#* The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final.\n#* Congress shall regulate the [[post office]]s; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces.\n#* The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress.\n#* Congress may request requisitions (demands for payments or supplies) from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit.\n#* Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a [[commander in chief]] without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months.\n# When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by \"The committee of the states, or any nine of them\", except for those powers of Congress which require nine states ''in'' Congress to execute.\n# If Canada [referring to the British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]] accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp|title=Avalon Project - Articles of Confederation : March 1, 1781|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref> No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states.\n#Affirms that the Confederation will honor all [[Engagements Clause#The precursor in the Articles of Confederation|bills of credit incurred, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by Congress]] before the existence of the Articles.\n# Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures.\n\n==Congress under the Articles==\n\n===The army===\nUnder the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the [[Continental Army]], but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food.<ref>{{cite book| last = Carp| first = E.

The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.<ref>Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165\u2013166. Phelps wrote:\n:\"It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.\"</ref>}}\n\nThe Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.<ref>Puls pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Knox wrote:\n\n{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, \"A hoop to the barrel\" or \"Cement to the Union\".<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\">Puls p. 177</ref>}}\n\nAs Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, \"As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\" />\n\nOnce the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small [[First American Regiment|national force]] was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}</ref>\n\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Keith L. |last= Dougherty |title= An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775\u20131783 |journal= Social Science History |date=  Spring 2009 |volume= 33 |issue= 1 |pages= 47\u201374 |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Confederation Period#Foreign affairs}}\nThe 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a [[quorum]] so that it could be ratified. Afterward, the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time, causing difficulties in raising a [[quorum]]. The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists, including George Washington. Many of the most prominent national leaders, such as Washington, [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]], retired from public life, served as foreign delegates, or held office in state governments; and for the general public, local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory. This served to exacerbate Congress's impotence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferling|first1=John|title=A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic|url=https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl/page/255 255\u2013259]}}</ref>\n\nInherent weaknesses in the confederation's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary pirates]], wrote in a [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|diplomatic correspondence]] to [[James Monroe]] that, \"It will be said there is no money in the treasury.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1954, pp. 560\u2013566]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the 1786 [[Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty]] with [[Spain]] also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty, which was never ratified, the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795, after the federal Constitution came into force.\n\n===Taxation and commerce===\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789| url = https://archive.org/details/newnationhistory0000jens_x8b5/page/177| year = 1950| publisher = Northeastern University Press| isbn = 978-0-930350-14-7| pages = [https://archive.org/details/newnationhistory0000jens_x8b5/page/177 177\u2013233]}}</ref>\n\nCongress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, \"that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.\"<ref>Stahr p. 105</ref> Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were \"the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.\"<ref>Stahr p. 107</ref> He argued that Americans should avoid having it said \"that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent\" or that \"her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.\"<ref>Stahr pp. 107\u2013108</ref> The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.\n\nCongress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.\n\n===Accomplishments===\n{{details|Admission to the Union#Articles of Confederation}}\n{{more footnotes|section|date=January 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the [[admission to the Union|admission of new states]] and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for [[public domain (land)|public use]]. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward\u2014as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sat\u014d| first=Sh\u014dsuke| url=https://archive.org/details/historylandques00satgoog| title=History of the land question in the United States| publisher=Isaac Friedenwald, for [[Johns Hopkins University]]| location=Baltimore, Maryland| date=1886| page=352|orig-year=Digitized 2008| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]].  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866|Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], eventually became the states of: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states.\n\nNo new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as \"Canada\" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin),  [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] to the Union were considered, but none were approved.\n\n===Presidents of Congress===\n{{Further|President of the Continental Congress}}\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the presiding officer of Congress\u2014referred to in many official records as ''President of the United States in Congress Assembled''\u2014chaired the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = 178\u2013179 }}</ref>\n\nThere were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles.

However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786\u201387, [[Shays' Rebellion]], an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Murrin| first1 = John M.| title = Liberty, Equality, Power, A History of the American People: To 1877| year = 2008| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company| isbn = 978-1-111-83086-1| page = 187}}</ref>\n\nThe Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression \"not worth a continental\".

Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ferling| first = John| title = John Adams: A Life| year = 2010| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-975273-7| pages = 257\u20138 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.

[[Alexander Hamilton]] realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.<ref>{{cite book| last = Chernow| first = Ron| title = Alexander Hamilton| url = https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher| url-access = registration| year = 2004| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-1-101-20085-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Signatures==\nThe Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.\n\nThe Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.\n\nOn July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also were unable to sign that day, since their delegations were absent.\n\nAfter the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.\n\nThe other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland [[History of Maryland#The Revolutionary period|refused to ratify]] the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims. [[Anne-C\u00e9sar, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Chevalier de La Luzerne]], French [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] would do what he could but La Luzerne also \u201csharply pressed\u201d Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sioussat |first= St. George L.|date= October 1936 |title= THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE AND THE RATIFICATION OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BY MARYLAND, 1780-1781 With Accompanying Documents|url= https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/28432/28188 |journal= The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume= 60|issue= 4|pages= 391\u2013418 |access-date= April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation, February 2, 1781]]\nOn February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].<ref name=\"lawsofmaryland\">{{cite web |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015508/http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |archivedate= July 23, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned \"to the first Monday in August next.\" The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.\n\nCongress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.

At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a \"Grand Convention.\" Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:\n\n{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.<ref>McDonald pg. 276</ref>}}\n\nIn May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.\n\nHistorian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:\n\n{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the \"consolidated government\" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a \"splendid empire\" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ketcham| first = Ralph| title = Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&pg=PA381| year = 1990| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| isbn = 978-0-945612-19-3| page = 383 }}</ref>}}\n\nHistorians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.\n\nRakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures \"stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.\"<ref>Rakove 1988 p. 230</ref> The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new \"merchant state,\" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.<ref>Hendrickson p. 154</ref>\n\n===Legitimacy of closing down===\nPolitical scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"<ref>Hendrickson p. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n\n<blockquote>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\n\n<blockquote>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</blockquote>\n\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\"  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.<ref name=Maier>Maier, Pauline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-DvolFMBVRgC&pg=PA62 Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787\u20131788]'', p. 62 (Simon and Schuster, 2011).</ref>  Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.<ref name=Maier />\n\nModern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus \"other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule\".<ref>Martin, Francisco.

The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be \"unadvisable\" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so \"under the Articles of Confederation\" only, but not \"under the Constitution\".<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kesavan| first1=Vasan| title=When Did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law| journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=December 1, 2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3 |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other [[Sant (religion)|sants]] of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is ''nirguna'' which, writes Vaudeville, is same as \"the [[Upanishad]]ic concept of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Brahman-Atman]] and the monistic [[Advaita]] interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature\".{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=26}} Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external [[bhakti]]. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating \"union with God\" from the concept of \"merging into God, or Oneness in all beings\". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the ''saguna'' prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the ''nirguna'' Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=27-33|ps= with footnotes}}\n\n[[David Lorenzen|David N. Lorenzen]] and Adri\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz trace these ideas of God in Kabir's philosophy as ''nirguna Brahman'' to those in [[Adi Shankara]]'s theories on [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=48}}\n\n===Influence of Islam===\nLorenzen in his review of Kabir's philosophy and poetry writes, \"the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition. Nonetheless, it is hard not to see the influence of Islam in his insistence on devotion to a single God, a god Kabir most often calls Ram\".{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=48}}\n\nSome scholars state that the sexual imagery in some of Kabir's poems reflect a mystic Sufi Islam influence, wherein Kabir inverts the traditional Sufi representation of a God-woman and devotee-man longing for a union, and instead uses the imagery of Lord-husband and devotee-bride.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=177\u2013178|ps= with footnote 26}} Other scholars, in contrast, state that it is unclear if Sufi ideas influenced Bhakti sants like Kabir or it was vice versa, suggesting that they probably co-developed through mutual interaction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIOSb97ph3EC&pg=PA116|title=India's Agony Over Religion|last=Larson|first=Gerald James|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791424111|pages=116|oclc=30544951}}</ref>\n\nKabir left Islam, states Ronald McGregor, but that does not mean Kabir adopted Hindu beliefs.<ref name=ronaldsikh/> Kabir, nevertheless, criticized practices such as killing and eating a cow by Muslims, in a manner Hindus criticized those practices:\n\n{{Quote\n|<poem>\nWe have searched the ''turaki Dharam'' ([[Delhi Sultanate|Turk's religion]], Islam), these teachers throw many thunderbolts,\nRecklessly they display boundless pride while explaining their own aims, they kill cows.\nHow can they kill the mother, whose milk they drink like that of a wet nurse?\nThe young and the old drink milk pudding, but these fools eat the cow's body.\nThese morons know nothing, they wander about in ignorance,\nWithout looking into one's heart, how can one reach paradise?\n</poem>\n|Kabir, Ramaini 1|Translated by [[David Lorenzen]]{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=27}} }}\n\n===Persecution and social impact===\nKabir's couplets suggest he was persecuted for his views, while he was alive.

The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a \"protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation\", they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=5-6}} However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir's own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=16-35}}\n\n==Legacy==\nKabir literature legacy was championed by two of his disciples, Bh\u0101god\u0101s and Dharmad\u0101s.

Popular renderings include Halke Gaadi Haanko, Chadariya Jhini and Chor Awega. Kabir Cafe claims that living their lives just as Kabir suggests has led to them experiencing some of these truths and it reflects in their performances.[https://m.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/our-band-s-first-member-is-kabir-neeraj-arya-s-kabir-cafe/story-MSBwRyh0z9kAPtk1bMvEOL.html]\n\nNoted classical singer, late [[Kumar Gandharva]], is widely recognized for his wonderful rendering of Kabir's poetry.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker [[Shabnam Virmani]], from the [[Kabir Project]], has produced a series of documentaries and books tracing Kabir's philosophy, music and poetry in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other [[Sant (religion)|sants]] of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is ''nirguna'' which, writes Vaudeville, is same as \"the [[Upanishad]]ic concept of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Brahman-Atman]] and the monistic [[Advaita]] interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature\".{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=26}} Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external [[bhakti]]. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating \"union with God\" from the concept of \"merging into God, or Oneness in all beings\". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the ''saguna'' prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the ''nirguna'' Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=27-33|ps= with footnotes}}\n\n[[David Lorenzen|David N. Lorenzen]] and Adri\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz trace these ideas of God in Kabir's philosophy as ''nirguna Brahman'' to those in [[Adi Shankara]]'s theories on [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Mu\u00f1oz | 2012 | p=48}}\n\n===Influence of Islam===\nLorenzen in his review of Kabir's philosophy and poetry writes, \"the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition.
