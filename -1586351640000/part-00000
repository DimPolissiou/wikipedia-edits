In the [[Middle East]], pumpkin is used for sweet dishes; a well-known sweet delicacy is called ''halawa yaqtin''. In the [[Indian subcontinent]], pumpkin is cooked with butter, sugar, and spices in a dish called ''kadu ka halwa''. Pumpkin is used to make ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' in [[Udupi cuisine]]. In [[Guangxi]] province, [[China]], the leaves of the pumpkin plant are consumed as a cooked [[vegetable]] or in soups. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], pumpkin is often roasted in conjunction with other vegetables. In [[Japan]], small pumpkins are served in savory dishes, including [[tempura]]. In [[Myanmar]], pumpkins are used in both cooking and desserts (candied). The seeds are a popular sunflower seed substitute. In [[Thailand]], small pumpkins are steamed with custard inside and served as a [[dessert]]. In Vietnam, pumpkins are commonly cooked in soups with pork or shrimp.

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'', and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J.

Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"<ref name=\"SilvermanTHR\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsVulture\"/> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/><ref name=\"WarnerBrosResponse\"/> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name=\"RovenFallout\"/> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name=\"EmmerichCCO\"/> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name=\"GreenLanternWriters\"/> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsTheWrap\"/> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name=\"Shakeup2\"/><ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsExit\"/> After the financial success of ''Aquaman'', Warner Bros.

with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\"/><ref name=\"DCCUYahoo\"/><ref name=\"DCCU-EW\"/> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\u2122\" as a joke in an article of his about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name=\"DCEU-EW\"/><ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name=\"TheyAreLegend\"/><ref name=\"BvSEmpireCover\"/> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term is not used internally and they do not consider it official.<ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".<ref name=\"JLU-SR\"/> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".<ref name=\"WoDC-SR\"/><ref name=\"WoDCForbes\"/> Despite this, there has been no official announcement from Warner Bros. nor DC Films to confirm this.}} is an unofficial term used to refer to an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'', and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentHell\"/><ref name=\"BalePetersenMTV\"/> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name=\"JusticeVariety2007\"/> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name=\"BaleJusticeLeague\"/> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"RouthJusticeLeague\"/> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name=\"MillerVariety\"/> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name=\"JLMortalVariety\"/> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, [[Adam Brody]] as Flash, [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Aquaman, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Green Lantern, [[Megan Gale]] as Wonder Woman, [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] as [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name=\"GaleWonderWoman\"/> The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure [[tax breaks]] for filming in Australia, as well as the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]] preventing progress on the script.<ref name=\"JusticeLeagueCancelled\"/>\n\nIn 2013, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' franchise]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.<ref name=\"ManOfSteelEW\"/> The film contained references to other characters in the [[DC Universe]], so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.<ref name=\"MoSBleedingCool\"/><ref name=\"ManofSteelSR\"/> Days before ''Man of Steel''{{'}}s release in June, it was reported that director [[Zack Snyder]] and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name=\"GoyerMoSSequel\"/> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name=\"LATimesCC2013\"/><ref name=\"EWCC2013\"/> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name=\"2014Slate\"/>\n\n[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]\nWhile the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other.

Teeth have recesses on their biting surfaces; the back teeth have fissures (grooves) and some front teeth have [[Cingulum (tooth)|cingulum pit]]s. It is these pits and fissures which are most vulnerable to tooth decay because food and bacteria stick in them and because they are hard-to-clean areas. Dental sealants are materials placed in these pits and fissures to fill them in, creating a smooth surface which is easy to clean. Dental sealants are mainly used in children who are at higher risk of tooth decay, and are usually placed as soon as the adult molar teeth come through.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:MandibularLeftFirstMolar08-15-06.jpg|thumbnail|Back teeth showing fissure system]]\n[[Dental caries]] is an upset of the balance between loss and gain of minerals from a tooth surface.<ref name=\"Featherstone\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Featherstone JD | title = Dental caries: a dynamic disease process | journal = Australian Dental Journal | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 286\u201391 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18782377 | doi = 10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00064.x }}</ref> The loss of minerals from the teeth occurs from the bacteria within the mouth, fermenting foods and producing acids, whereas the tooth gains minerals from our [[saliva]] and fluoride that is present within the mouth.<ref name =Featherstone/> When this balance is skewed due to frequent intake of fermentable carbohydrates, poor oral hygiene, and lack of fluoride consumption, there is a continuous loss and little gain of minerals over a long period of time, which can ultimately cause what is known as tooth decay.<ref name =Featherstone/>\n\nDental sealants are a preventive treatment that is part of the minimal intervention dentistry approach to dental care.<ref name=\"White\">White J.M., & Eakle W.S. Rationale and Treatment Approach in Minimally Invasive Dentistry. Journal of the American Dental Association, 2000.</ref> These sealants are a [[plastic]] material placed in the pits and fissures (the recesses on the chewing surfaces) of primary (baby) or permanent (adult) molar and premolar teeth at the back of the mouth. These molar teeth are considered the most susceptible teeth to [[dental caries]] due to the anatomy of the chewing surfaces of these teeth, which inhibits protection from [[saliva]] and [[fluoride]] and instead favours [[dental plaque|plaque]] accumulation.<ref name=\"Welbury2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Welbury R, Raadal M, Lygidakis NA | title = EAPD guidelines for the use of pit and fissure sealants | journal = European Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 179\u201384 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15471528 | url = http://www.eapd.gr/dat/D052751D/file.pdf | access-date = 2015-07-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160122205953/http://www.eapd.gr/dat/D052751D/file.pdf | archive-date = 2016-01-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref> This approach facilitates prevention and early intervention, in order to prevent or stop the [[dental caries]] process before it reaches the ends stage of the disease, which is also known as the \"hole\" or cavitation of a tooth.<ref name=\"White\" /> Once the tooth is cavitated, it requires a [[dental restoration]] in order to repair the damage, which emphasizes the importance of prevention in preserving teeth for a lifetime of chewing.\n\nPreventing tooth decay from the pits and fissures of the teeth is achieved by dental sealants providing a physical barricade to protect natural tooth surfaces and grooves, inhibiting build-up of bacteria and food trapped within such fissures and grooves. Dental sealants also provide a smooth surface that is easily accessible for both the natural protective factor, [[saliva]] and the toothbrush bristles when cleaning the teeth.<ref name=\"dental health\">Fissure sealants. http://www.dentalhealth.ie/download/pdf/fissure_sealant_booklet.pdf.

These indications mainly stem from issues that would cause a patient to be considered high caries risk, in order to prevent dental caries.\n\nThese indications are:\n\n* Patients who are at increased risk of caries due to factors such as poor oral hygiene, lack of exposure to fluoride, previous and present caries experience, any current orthodontic treatment<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peelregion.ca/health/library/pdf/PFS.pdf|title=Effective Use of Pit and Fissure Sealants to Prevent Pit and Fissure Caries on the Permanent Posterior Teeth of Children and Youth|last=Khan|first=Nadine|date=April 2015|website=Peel Region|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* High sugar diet which increases the patient\u2019s susceptibility to dental caries<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Teeth with enamel defects such as MIH, although the enamel defects may make it difficult to bond dental sealants to the tooth it is still essential that these teeth are sealed as the poor quality enamel makes then more susceptible to dental decay<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Patients which complicated medical history e.g. patients with underlying systemic diseases as this could increases the patients caries risk possibly due to having dry mouth as a result of medications or having prolonged treatment which could affect a patients ability to undertake adequate oral hygiene and maintain a low sugar diet <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/BP_Chemo.pdf|title=Dental Management of Paediatric Patients Receiving Immunosuppressive Therapy and/or Radiation Therapy|last=|first=|date=2018|website=AAPD|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Early carious lesions can be treated with dental sealants in order to prevent invasive dental restorations.

For resin fissure sealants to be successful excellent moisture control is needed during placement of the fissure sealant. In cases where moisture control cannot be achieved then Glass Ionomer fissure sealants should be placed until a time where moisture control is adequate enough to place resin fissure sealants.\n\n==Clinical procedure==\n{{sister project\n|project=Wikiversity\n|text=[[Wikiversity]] has learning materials related to: '''''[[wikiversity:Fissure sealants|Placement of fissure sealants]]'''''\n|position=\n}}\n[[File:ZahnarztAlen5690 Kofferdam.JPG|thumbnail|Dental dam|left]]\nThe exact technique depends on the material used and a good application technique will increase retention, which means sealants can last longer on the teeth.<ref name=\"Griffin 281\u2013289\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffin SO, Jones K, Gray SK, Malvitz DM, Gooch BF | title = Exploring four-handed delivery and retention of resin-based sealants | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages = 281\u20139; quiz 358 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18310732 | doi = 10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0157 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5541076 }}</ref> Generally, each quadrant is treated separately by using four-handed technique with an assistant and to follow the manufacturer's recommendations.<ref name=\"Griffin 281\u2013289\"/> The patient should wear safety glasses for protection from chemicals and curing light.

After that, the tooth must be rinsed and dried thoroughly for 15 to 20 seconds. Chalky appearance on the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated. The sealant is then applied to the tooth by carefully placing the sealant material into the prepared pits and fissures by using a disposable instrument provided by the manufacturer. Overfilling on the tooth should be prevented to minimize occlusal adjustment. The material is left for 10 seconds after the placement prior to curing to allow optimum penetration of the sealant material into the pores created by the etching procedure. Finally, the sealant is hardened by a curing light, which usually takes 20 to 30 seconds. Glass ionomer does not require light curing, however it will set faster with the usage of a curing light.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|title=Pit and Fissure Sealants: An Overview|url=http://www.rdhmag.com/content/dam/rdh/print-articles/Volume%2033/Issue10/1311cei_Mun%CC%83oz_RDH_7.pdf|journal=|volume=}}</ref>\n\nResin-based sealants require an absolutely dry surface until polymerization is complete, so it is essential to avoid salivary contamination of the sealant site. A rubber dam or cotton roll isolation technique can be used to isolate the sealant site from saliva which is the common reason for sealant failure. Glass ionomer sealants have the advantage of not needing a dry field to be effective. In fact, the application procedure for glass ionomers can involve pressing a saliva-moistened finger onto the occlusal surface to push the sealant material into the pits and fissures.\n\nCompared to a typical dental filling, where an injection of [[local anesthetic]] and the use of a [[dental drill]] may be involved, the application of dental sealants is significantly less invasive and generally considered quick and easy. The procedure is entirely painless, although a minor level of discomfort may be experienced by the patient. The etching gel may temporarily leave a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nPits and fissure sealants are used as effective controls in preventing caries. Sealants create a barrier which removes the biofilm from the occlusal surface. There are 4 sealant materials that can be used for the purpose of sealing pits and fissures.

Using cotton wool rolls, dry guards or a salvia ejector will give optimum isolation of the site. A [[Dental dam|rubber dam]] may be used to prevent saliva from contaminating the intended site to be sealed, although often these are not used, especially for younger children. Moisture control is more of an issue with resin based sealants than with glass ionomer sealants\n\n* Dry the tooth and etch the surface of the tooth that will be carrying the sealant - resin sealants require a [[phosphoric acid]] solution (\"etch\") to create microscopic porosity into which the sealant material can flow thereby increasing retention, increasing surface area and improving the strength of the bond between the sealant and the tooth surface. Etching time varies from 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the product.\n\n* Wash the etch with water and once again dry the tooth aiming to avoid any moisture contamination. A chalky appearance of the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated.\n\n* Apply the resin to the surface ensuring sufficient material has been applied to cover all areas \n\n* The sealant should now be light cured, this hardens the sealant \n\n* Check the integrity of the sealant with a probe. May need to check occlusion with articulating paper and reduce sealant height.\n* If the sealant cannot be picked off, application is successful. These sealants should be checked at recall appointments and re-applied as required.\n\n'''<u>GI Sealant Technique</u>'''\n\nFor partially erupted teeth which are difficult to isolate some will use GIC (doesn\u2019t need etching) as an interim option. GIC may have an advantage of fluoride release.\n\n* Ensure the tooth is free from any debris using a toothbrush or cotton wool roll. \n\n* Isolate the tooth from any moisture \n\n* Dry the tooth \n\n* Etch is not required for this technique \n\n* Have the GI sealant mixed\n\n* GI can be applied into fissures in several ways: using an excavator or using a finger \n\n* Following the application of sealant in the clinicians chosen way, a small amount if petroleum jelly should be applied to the sealant. Glass ionomer does not require light curing, however it will set faster with the usage of a curing light.\n\n* Ensure the sealant is not high in occlusion and removes any visible excess. These sealants should be checked at recall appointments and re-applied as required \n\nCompared to a typical dental filling, where an injection of [[local anesthetic]] and the use of a [[dental drill]] may be involved, the application of dental sealants is significantly less invasive and generally considered quick and easy. The procedure is entirely painless, although a minor level of discomfort may be experienced by the patient.

It marked the culmination of the [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the fourth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won in both [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup|1982]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by eight wickets]] to claim their third world title.\n\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, but were hindered by a slow [[outfield]], and found scoring difficult. The humid conditions helped Australia's [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]], [[Lyn Fullston]] and [[Lyn Larsen]], who combined for five wickets. [[Jan Brittin]] top-scored for England with 46 runs, as they made 127 for seven. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing two early wickets for 14 runs. An unbroken [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 115 runs between [[Lindsay Reeler]] and [[Denise Annetts]] saw Australia to victory with more than 15 [[Over (cricket)|overs]] remaining. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the fourth [[Women's Cricket World Cup]]. The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref name=\"icc-hist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/womens-world-cup/history |title=ICC Women's World Cup History |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The 1988 tournament featured five teams; [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]], [[England women's cricket team|England]], [[Ireland women's cricket team|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands national women's cricket team|Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand national women's cricket team|New Zealand]]. It took place between 29 November and 18 December, featuring 22 matches over 20 days.<ref name=\"wisden\"/> England had won the first world cup on home soil, before Australia claimed both the next two. Neither of the first two tournaments had featured a final, but had rather been league competitions, in which the team which finished with the most points won. Australia had beaten England by three wickets in [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup Final|the final]] of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup|1982 World Cup]].<ref name=\"icc-hist\"/>\n\n==Route to the final==\n{{main|1988 Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nEach team played eight matches during the round-robin stage of the tournament, facing each other twice.

Hodges had scored 23, and England were 52 for two. Three of England's [[Batting order (cricket)|middle-order]] batters were dismissed for low scores: their captain, Powell, was [[caught behind]] off Larsen's bowling for one run; [[Karen Smithies|Karen Hicken]] was bowled by Fullston for five; [[Janet Aspinall]] was [[caught and bowled]] by Fullston for two.
