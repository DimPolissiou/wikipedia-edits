A week after its release, Curtis was stabbed to death outside his [[brownstone]] apartment in [[New York City]], following an argument with two drug addicts.<ref name=\"swampland\"/> The day after he died the album peaked at No. 54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, his greatest success as a solo artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/king_curtis.htm|title=King Curtis Biography|publisher=Soultracks.com|date=27 March 2011}}</ref>  There is a widely held misconception that Curtis was murdered on the night of this live performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.withnail-links.com/merchandise-cd.htm|title=Withnail Links&nbsp;\u2013 Soundtrack|publisher=Fan site|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>  Ralph Brown, in the audio commentary on the DVD issue of ''Withnail and I'', wrongly states that he was shot in the car park after the concert.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===''Live at Fillmore West'' (original edition)===\nReleased August 1971\n{{tracklist\n| total_length    = 44:30\n| title1          = Memphis Soul Stew\n| writer1         = [[King Curtis|Curtis Ousley]]\n| length1         = 7:41\n| title2          = [[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\n| writer2         = [[Gary Brooker]], [[Keith Reid]], [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]]\n| length2         = 5:26\n| title3          = [[Whole Lotta Love]]\n| writer3         = [[Willie Dixon]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[John Bonham]]\n| length3         = 2:16\n| title4          = I Stand Accused\n| writer4         = [[Jerry Butler]]\n| length4         = 6:05\n| title5          = Them Changes\n| writer5         = [[Buddy Miles]]\n| length5         = 7:01\n| title6          = [[Ode to Billie Joe]]\n| writer6         = [[Bobbie Gentry]]\n| length6         = 3:22\n| title7          = [[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]\n| writer7         = [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]\n| length7         = 4:30\n| title8          = [[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]\n| writer8         = [[Lee Garrett]], [[Lula Mae Hardaway]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Syreeta Wright]]\n| length8         = 2:37\n| title9          = Soul Serenade\n| writer9         = [[Luther Dixon]], Curtis Ousley\n| length9         = 5:32\n\n}}\n\n===''Live at Fillmore West'' (expanded edition)===\nReleased July 11, 2006, featuring 5 additional tracks.\n\n{{tracklist\n| total_length    = 67:07\n| title1          = Memphis Soul Stew\n| writer1         = [[King Curtis|Curtis Ousley]]\n| length1         = 7:41\n| title2          = [[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\n| writer2         = [[Gary Brooker]], [[Keith Reid]], [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]]\n| length2         = 5:26\n| title3          = [[Whole Lotta Love]]\n| writer3         = [[Led Zeppelin]]\n| length3         = 2:16\n| title4          = I Stand Accused\n| writer4         = [[Jerry Butler]]\n| length4         = 6:05\n| title5          = Them Changes\n| writer5         = [[Buddy Miles]]\n| length5         = 7:01\n| title6          = [[Ode to Billie Joe]]\n| writer6         = [[Bobbie Gentry]]\n| length6         = 3:22\n| title7          = [[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]\n| writer7         = [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]\n| length7         = 4:30\n| title8          = [[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]\n| writer8         = [[Lee Garrett]], [[Lula Mae Hardaway]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Syreeta Wright]]\n| length8         = 2:37\n| title9          = Soul Serenade\n| writer9         = [[Luther Dixon]], Curtis Ousley\n| length9         = 5:32\n| title10         = My Sweet Lord\n| writer10        = [[George Harrison]]\n| length10        = 2:33\n| title11         = Them Changes\n| note11          = alternate take\n| writer11        = [[Buddy Miles]]\n| length11        = 5:33\n| title12         = Ode to Billie Joe\n| note12          = alternate take\n| writer12        = Bobbie Gentry\n| length12        = 4:35\n| title13         = Soul Serenade\n| note13          = alternate take\n| writer13        = Luther Dixon, Curtis Ousley\n| length13        = 4:51\n| title14         = Memphis Soul Stew\n| note14          = alternate take\n| writer14        = Curtis Ousley\n| length14        = 5:05\n}}\n\n===''Don't Fight the Feeling: The Complete Aretha Franklin & King Curtis Live at Fillmore West''===\n4 CD Box-set.

It would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown to turn down this request, carrying much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to say no. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].\n\nFour-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]], and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]]. Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]]. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and his acquaintance Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] orchestrated the whole plan; they sought additional funding from a merchant named [[Blackham baronets|Sir Richard Blackham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/secret-agreement-between-pirate-hunters-1696 |title=A secret agreement between pirate hunters, 1696 |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]]}}</ref> Kidd also had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.\n\nThe new ship, ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts\" \"The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R.

The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.\n\n{{quote|As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich, as custom dictated. The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd's crew responded with an astounding display of impudence \u2013 by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], despite rampant protests. Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.\n\nAmong Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]] [[Hendrick van der Heul]]. The quartermaster was considered \"second in command\" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer. Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a \"small black Man\". If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest-ranking black pirate so far identified. Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel and was never convicted of piracy.\n\n===Hunting for pirates===\nIn September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew died on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].\n\nAs it became obvious that his ambitious enterprise was failing, Kidd became desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time that ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant open threats of [[mutiny]].\n\n[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, ''Adventure Galley'', in [[New York Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]\nKidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]] when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, \"If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more.\" Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.183</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright murder was not permitted. Yet Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had \"good friends in England, that will bring me off for that\".\n\n===Accusations of piracy===\nActs of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and \"drubbed\" (thrashed) with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised \"thirty men or so\".<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1961 p\"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 30 January 1698, Kidd raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Pirates of the High Seas \u2013 Capt.

The captain of ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal, as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to \"pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices\" for the \"notorious piracies\" they had committed.<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref>\n\nKidd kept the French sea passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for [[Madagascar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader [[Tempest Rogers]] (who would later be accused of trading and selling Kidd's looted East India goods),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office|first1=Great Britain Public Record|title=Calendar of State Papers: Colonial Series ...|date=1908|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=486\u2013487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBQFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd's ship years before) and his crew aboard ''Mocha Frigate''. Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford. According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he \"drank their Captain's health\", swearing that \"he was in every respect their Brother\", and gave Culliford \"a Present of an Anchor and some Guns\".<ref>Charles Johnson (1728). ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref> This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial. The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd''. According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came. After ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''. However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>\n\nBoth accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with ''Adventure Galley''. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some of his crew later returned to America on their own as passengers aboard [[Giles Shelley]]'s ship ''Nassau''.<ref name=\"Jameson - Privateering and Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=John Franklin|title=Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period by J.

There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]], and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref> He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder.

On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd survived.

Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence.

The game's theme is about outcasts/outlaws, as well as rebellion against the established order/society, and portrays several individuals (mostly from fiction) that fit this theme, such as [[Arsene Lupin]], [[Pope Joan]] and [[Ishikawa Goemon]].\n\nCaptain Kidd appears in ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]''.\n\nThe 1957 children's book ''Captain Kidd's Cat'' by [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]] is a largely fictionalized account of Kidd's last voyage, trial and execution, told from the point of view of his loyal ship's cat. The book portrays Kidd as an innocent privateer who was framed by corrupt officials as a scapegoat for their own crimes.\n\nThe song \"Ballad of William Kidd\" by the heavy metal band [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] is based on Kidd's life, particularly the events surrounding his trial and execution.\n\nA version of \"Ballad of William Kidd\" is sung by Commander Klaes Ashford in Seasons 3 and 4 of \"The Expanse\"\n\n\"The Ballad of William Kidd\" is performed by [[Blackbeard's Tea Party]], making reference to his life throughout the song.\n\n''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'' portrays a highly fictionalized version of Captain Kidd as a pirate in the Pacific with more of an American accent than a Scottish one who comes across the [[Doraemon]] and his friends that were caught in a time distortion. The combined group finds an island with secret treasure and is being used by a business from the future for his own benefit. Eventually, the businessman is captured by the Time Patrol and Kidd continues his voyage.\n\nThe character of Ogin in the anime [[Girls und Panzer]] models herself heavily on Kidd, particularly with regard to her personality and leadership style. She is the commander of a British [[Mark IV tank]] in \"Das Finale\".\n \nThe band [[Scissorfight]] had a song called \"The Gibbeted Captain Kidd\" on their 1998 album ''[[Balls Deep (album)|Balls Deep]]''.\n\nIn the manga and anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a character named Eustass \"Captain\" Kid, whose name and epithet are inspired by the real-life Captain Kidd.\n\nFour missions in [[Assassin's Creed III]] involve finding map pieces that Captain Kidd had given to four of his crew members for safekeeping. Finding all four pieces would reveal the location of Kidd's treasure, which in the Assassin's Creed series is a Piece of Eden that gives the player the ability to repel bullets.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joseph Bradish]], a pirate who sailed in Kidd's company<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7NLrJnuzHQC&pg=PA80|title=Under the Black Flag: Exploits of the Most Notorious Pirates|last=Seitz|first=Don Carlos|date=1 March 2002|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486421315|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[George Dew]], buccaneer, pirate, and privateer who briefly sailed alongside Kidd in 1691 near the [[Piscataqua River]].<ref name=\"Marley\">{{cite book|last1=Marley|first1=David|title=Pirates of the Americas|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara CA|isbn=9781598842012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU6ML_VnXTwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Captain Kidd's Cannon]]\n* [[Gardiners Island]]\n* [[Oak Island]]\n* ''[[Treasure Island]]''\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| author = Botting, Douglas | year = 1978 | title = The Pirates | location =Boston, MA| publisher = Little Brown & Company | isbn = 0316848948 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0316848948 | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}\n* {{cite book| author = Cordingly, David | year = 1995 | title = Under The Black Flag : The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates | publisher = Harcourt Brace & Company | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* {{cite book| author = Hamilton, Cochran | year = 1961 | title = Pirates of the Spanish Main | edition = 1st | series = American Heritage Junior Library  | location = New York | publisher = American Heritage | isbn = 0060213469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3iIYAAAAYAAJ | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Books===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Campbell (1853).

It would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown to turn down this request, carrying much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to say no. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].\n\nFour-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]], and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]]. Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]]. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and his acquaintance Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] orchestrated the whole plan; they sought additional funding from a merchant named [[Blackham baronets|Sir Richard Blackham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/secret-agreement-between-pirate-hunters-1696 |title=A secret agreement between pirate hunters, 1696 |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]]}}</ref> Kidd also had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.\n\nThe new ship, ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts\" \"The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R.

The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.\n\n{{quote|As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich, as custom dictated. The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd's crew responded with an astounding display of impudence \u2013 by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], despite rampant protests. Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.\n\nAmong Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]] [[Hendrick van der Heul]]. The quartermaster was considered \"second in command\" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer. Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a \"small black Man\". If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest-ranking black pirate so far identified. Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel and was never convicted of piracy.\n\n===Hunting for pirates===\nIn September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew died on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].\n\nAs it became obvious that his ambitious enterprise was failing, Kidd became desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time that ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant open threats of [[mutiny]].\n\n[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, ''Adventure Galley'', in [[New York Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]\nKidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]] when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, \"If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more.\" Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.183</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright murder was not permitted. Yet Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had \"good friends in England, that will bring me off for that\".\n\n===Accusations of piracy===\nActs of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and \"drubbed\" (thrashed) with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised \"thirty men or so\".<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1961 p\"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 30 January 1698, Kidd raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Pirates of the High Seas \u2013 Capt.

The captain of ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal, as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to \"pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices\" for the \"notorious piracies\" they had committed.<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref>\n\nKidd kept the French sea passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for [[Madagascar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader [[Tempest Rogers]] (who would later be accused of trading and selling Kidd's looted East India goods),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office|first1=Great Britain Public Record|title=Calendar of State Papers: Colonial Series ...|date=1908|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=486\u2013487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBQFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd's ship years before) and his crew aboard ''Mocha Frigate''. Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford. According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he \"drank their Captain's health\", swearing that \"he was in every respect their Brother\", and gave Culliford \"a Present of an Anchor and some Guns\".<ref>Charles Johnson (1728). ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref> This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial. The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd''. According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came. After ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''. However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>\n\nBoth accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with ''Adventure Galley''. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some of his crew later returned to America on their own as passengers aboard [[Giles Shelley]]'s ship ''Nassau''.<ref name=\"Jameson - Privateering and Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=John Franklin|title=Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period by J.

There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]], and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref> He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder.

On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd survived.

Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence.

The game's theme is about outcasts/outlaws, as well as rebellion against the established order/society, and portrays several individuals (mostly from fiction) that fit this theme, such as [[Arsene Lupin]], [[Pope Joan]] and [[Ishikawa Goemon]].\n\nCaptain Kidd appears in ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]''.\n\nThe 1957 children's book ''Captain Kidd's Cat'' by [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]] is a largely fictionalized account of Kidd's last voyage, trial and execution, told from the point of view of his loyal ship's cat. The book portrays Kidd as an innocent privateer who was framed by corrupt officials as a scapegoat for their own crimes.\n\nThe song \"Ballad of William Kidd\" by the heavy metal band [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] is based on Kidd's life, particularly the events surrounding his trial and execution.\n\nA version of \"Ballad of William Kidd\" is sung by Commander Klaes Ashford in Seasons 3 and 4 of \"The Expanse\"\n\n\"The Ballad of William Kidd\" is performed by [[Blackbeard's Tea Party]], making reference to his life throughout the song.\n\n''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'' portrays a highly fictionalized version of Captain Kidd as a pirate in the Pacific with more of an American accent than a Scottish one who comes across the [[Doraemon]] and his friends that were caught in a time distortion. The combined group finds an island with secret treasure and is being used by a business from the future for his own benefit. Eventually, the businessman is captured by the Time Patrol and Kidd continues his voyage.\n\nThe character of Ogin in the anime [[Girls und Panzer]] models herself heavily on Kidd, particularly with regard to her personality and leadership style. She is the commander of a British [[Mark IV tank]] in \"Das Finale\".\n \nThe band [[Scissorfight]] had a song called \"The Gibbeted Captain Kidd\" on their 1998 album ''[[Balls Deep (album)|Balls Deep]]''.\n\nIn the manga and anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a character named Eustass \"Captain\" Kid, whose name and epithet are inspired by the real-life Captain Kidd.\n\nFour missions in [[Assassin's Creed III]] involve finding map pieces that Captain Kidd had given to four of his crew members for safekeeping. Finding all four pieces would reveal the location of Kidd's treasure, which in the Assassin's Creed series is a Piece of Eden that gives the player the ability to repel bullets.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joseph Bradish]], a pirate who sailed in Kidd's company<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7NLrJnuzHQC&pg=PA80|title=Under the Black Flag: Exploits of the Most Notorious Pirates|last=Seitz|first=Don Carlos|date=1 March 2002|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486421315|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[George Dew]], buccaneer, pirate, and privateer who briefly sailed alongside Kidd in 1691 near the [[Piscataqua River]].<ref name=\"Marley\">{{cite book|last1=Marley|first1=David|title=Pirates of the Americas|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara CA|isbn=9781598842012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU6ML_VnXTwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Captain Kidd's Cannon]]\n* [[Gardiners Island]]\n* [[Oak Island]]\n* ''[[Treasure Island]]''\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| author = Botting, Douglas | year = 1978 | title = The Pirates | location =Boston, MA| publisher = Little Brown & Company | isbn = 0316848948 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0316848948 | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}\n* {{cite book| author = Cordingly, David | year = 1995 | title = Under The Black Flag : The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates | publisher = Harcourt Brace & Company | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* {{cite book| author = Hamilton, Cochran | year = 1961 | title = Pirates of the Spanish Main | edition = 1st | series = American Heritage Junior Library  | location = New York | publisher = American Heritage | isbn = 0060213469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3iIYAAAAYAAJ | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Books===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Campbell (1853).

Sam Weber invented Gumbo in 1658. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored [[Stock (food)|stock]], meat or [[shellfish]], a [[Thickening agent#Food|thickener]], and what Louisianians call the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|\"Holy Trinity\" of vegetables]], namely [[celery]], [[bell pepper]]s, and [[onion]]s. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether [[okra]] or [[fil\u00e9 powder]] (dried and ground [[Sassafras albidum|sassafras]] leaves). \n\nGumbo can be made with or without okra or fil\u00e9 powder. The preferred method in the historical [[Cuisine of New Orleans|New Orleans variation]] is with a French dark [[roux]]. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures.  [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, fil\u00e9, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine. [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or [[fowl]]. [[Sausage]] or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over [[rice]]. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked [[leaf vegetable|greens]].\n\nThe dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, German, and [[Choctaw]]. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish [[bouillabaisse]], or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the [[United States Senate]] dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator [[Allen Ellender]]. The popularity of chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the dish comes from [[Louisiana French]]. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the [[etymology]] of the word \"gumbo\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or fil\u00e9. In the [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] spoken by many [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as ''ki ngombo'' or ''quingombo''; the word is akin to the [[Umbundu]] ''ochingg\u00f4mbo'' and the [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]] ''chingg\u00f4mb\u00f4'' \"okra\". In the language of the native [[Choctaw]] people, fil\u00e9, or ground [[sassafras]] leaves, was called ''kombo''.<ref name=nobles98>Nobles (2009), p. 98.</ref><ref name=usner46/><ref>{{citation|editor-last=Babcock Gove|editor-first=Philip|title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary|editor-link=Philip Babcock Gove|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1986|isbn=0-85229-503-0|page=1011|chapter=gumbo|volume=2|title-link=Webster's Third New International Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{quote box|quote=Gumbo is a veritable art form in Louisiana.

If added during the boiling process, fil\u00e9 makes the gumbo too [[wikt:ropy|ropey]];<ref name=gutierrez57/> when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.<ref name=davidson126/>\n\nRoux has become the most popular thickener,<ref name=davidson126>Davidson and Jain (2006), p. 126.</ref> made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog [[lard]], although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century<ref name=nobles113>Nobles (2009), p. 113.</ref>). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains.  A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.<ref name=nobles113/>\n\n===Cajun vs. Creole gumbo===\n[[File:Cajun seafood gumbo.jpg|left|thumb|Cajun seafood gumbo]]\n[[File:Seafood Creole Gumbo.jpg|right|thumb|Creole seafood gumbo]]\nGumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in [[Cuisine of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and southeastern Louisiana are known as \"Creole\" after the [[Louisiana Creole people]], descendants of French and Spanish settlers, and enslaved African people, who lived in those areas. \"Cajun\" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by [[Cajun]]s, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from [[Acadia]] (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]) in the mid-18th century.<ref name=nobles107/><ref name=broussard-marin>{{citation |last=Broussard-Marin |first=Lydia |last2=Hynak-Hankinson |first2=Mary Therese |title=Ethnic food: the use of Cajun cuisine as a model |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |date=August 1989 |volume=89 |issue=8 |url=http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |page=1117&ndash;1121 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234453/http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGumbo is usually identified by its dark roux,<ref name=nobles111/> cooked until it is a color \"a few shades from burning\".<ref name=nobles113/> The roux is used with okra or fil\u00e9 powder.<ref name=nobles111/>  Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage.<ref name=nobles111/><ref name=gutierrez55and56/>  The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish.<ref name=nobles111/>  Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.<ref name=nobles111/>\n\nCreole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener.<ref name=nobles107/>  Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.<ref name=nobles113/>\n\n===Gumbo z'herbes===\n[[File:Zherbes.jpg|right|thumb|Gumbo z'herbes, served with [[fil\u00e9 powder]] and hot sauce]]\nWhen Catholics were expected to [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|abstain from eating meat]] during [[Lent]], a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from ''gumbo aux herbes'', or \"gumbo of greens\"), was often served.<ref name=williams160>Williams (2012), p. 160</ref> This variety combined varied [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] &ndash; typically including [[turnip]]s, [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], and [[spinach]].<ref name=gutierrez57>Gutierrez (1992), p. 57.</ref>  The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid.

German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.<ref name=nobles110 />\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nGumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana.<ref name=nobles98/>  The dish combines the culinary practices of French, Spanish, as well as Italians, and Germans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived together within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. This fostered an environment in which cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.<ref name=\"brasseaux134\">Brasseaux (1987), p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=The dish personifies the word 'Creole'; like its human counterparts, gumbo was born in the New World and took cues from the old but adapted to the new.|width=30%|align=left|source= \u2014  Cynthia Lejeune Nobles<ref name=nobles98/>}}\n\nThe establishment of [[New Orleans]] in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=hall159>Hall (1992), p. 159.</ref> French settlers allied with various native tribes including the [[Choctaw]], [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]], and [[Cherokee]],<ref name=hall19>Hall (1992), p. 19.</ref><ref name=bienvenue134/> from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.<ref name=hall14>Hall (1992), p. 14.</ref>\n\nSlave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719.

From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans.<ref name=nobles102/> Louisiana was secretly returned to France [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|in 1800]], then [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.\n\nBy 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra,<ref name=brasseaux135>Brasseaux (1987), p. 135.</ref> and hot pepper plants which likely came from [[Haiti]].<ref name=nobles103>Nobles (2009), p. 103.</ref> Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions.<ref name=bienvenue134/> Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.<ref name=nobles105>Nobles (2009), p. 105.</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nScholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century,<ref name=nobles98/> but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food.<ref name=usner46>Usner (2000), p. 46.</ref> Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.<ref name=bienvenue134>Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 134.</ref>\n\nAs aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American Caribbean and German influence. [[African Americans|African-American]] slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.<ref name=\"Hicks, Derek S. 2014\">Hicks, Derek S. \"An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion\". In Religion, Food, and Eating in North America, edited by Benjamin E. Zeller, Marie W. Dallam, Reid L. Neilson, and Nora L. Rubel, 134-154. New York: Columbia University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\nWest Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups.<ref name=\"bienvenue134\" /> Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.<ref name=\"nobles100\">Nobles (2009), p. 100.</ref>\n\nGumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew [[bouillabaisse]].<ref name=\"gutierrez54\" /><ref name=\"nobles99\" /> During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups,<ref name=\"brasseaux134\" /> using whatever ingredients were readily available.<ref name=\"nobles103\" /> When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage.<ref name=\"brasseaux134\" /> In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.<ref name=\"gutierrez54\" />\n\nSome culinary experts in the early 20th century, including [[Celestine Eustis]], maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes.<ref name=nobles99/> This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn [[grits]], a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and fil\u00e9 powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.<ref name=nobles100/>\n\nThese theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine &ndash; rice, shrimp, crawfish, and fil\u00e9 powder.<ref name=nobles99>Nobles (2009), p. 99.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, [[John Sibley (doctor)|John Sibley]] described \"the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop {{sic}} & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.\"<ref name=nobles104q>quoted in Nobles (2009), p. 104.</ref> The following year, French governor [[Pierre Clement de Laussat]] hosted a soir\u00e9e in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events \"give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined\".<ref name=nobles104/>\n\nAn 1824 cookbook, [[Mary Randolph]]'s ''The Virginia House-Wife'', was the first to include a recipe for gumbo.  Called \"Gumbo&nbsp;\u2013 A West India Dish\", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for \"Ochra Soup\" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish [[callaloo]].<ref name=nobles106>Nobles (2009), p. 106.</ref>\n\nA more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree.  Her ''Housekeeping in Old Virginia'' described \"Gumbo Filit A La Creole\", a fil\u00e9-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with [[allspice]], cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme.<ref name=nobles106/> The 1881 cookbook ''[[What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking]]'', dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. \"Oyster Gumbo Soup\" used a fil\u00e9 base, while \"Ochra Gumbo\" and \"Chicken Gumbo\" used okra as a base.<ref name=nobles106/> Four years later, the cookbook ''La Cuisine Creole'' documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.<ref name=nobles102/>\n\nUntil the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]. It gained a broader profile after the death of [[United States Senator]] [[Allen Ellender]]. A native of [[Terrebonne Parish, LA|Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]], Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef [[Paul Prudhomme]]'s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.<ref name=nobles114>Nobles (2009), p. 114.</ref>\n\n==Preparation and serving==\nGumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called ''cooked down''), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water or [[Stock (food)|stock]], then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached.<ref name=gutierrez57/> Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[thyme]], [[hot sauce]], and salt, are added to taste.<ref name=broussard-marin/>  According to Nobles, \"proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art\".<ref name=nobles103/> Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added last.<ref name=gutierrez57/>\n\nCreole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice,<ref name=\"bienvenue134\"/> which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people.<ref name=gutierrez56/> Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side.<ref name=gutierrez57/> Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a [[tureen]] on the table.<ref name=nobles112>Nobles (2009), p. 112.</ref> Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal,<ref name=gutierrez54>Gutierrez (1992), p. 54.</ref> although many Cajun families provide a side dish of [[potato salad]].<ref name=nobles111/> Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.<ref name=gutierrez54/>\n\nSoniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.<ref name=Soniat13>Soniat (1980), p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Social aspects==\nIn ''Cajun Foodways'', C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as \"an economical dish\" useful for \"feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood\".<ref name=gutierrez56/>  Nobles concurs that \"one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd\".<ref name=nobles105/>  With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.  The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.<ref name=gutierrez56/>\n\nSince the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.<ref name=bienvenue135>Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 135.</ref><ref name=brasseaux135/>  Local [[fais do-do]] (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight.<ref name=nobles105/>  Many families \"have a gumbo\", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.<ref name=bienvenue135/>\n\nGumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.\n\nIn rural [[Acadiana]] in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of [[Mardi Gras]] celebrations.  On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as [[courir de Mardi Gras]].<ref name=\"nobles105\" /> Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo.  When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when [[Lent]] begins.<ref name=\"nobles106\">Nobles (2009), p. 106.</ref>\n\nGumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.<ref name=nobles98/> Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo,<ref name=bienvenue135/> and it is a central feature of many local festivals.<ref name=gutierrez114>Gutierrez (1992), p. 114.</ref> The self-described \"Gumbo Capital of the World\", [[Bridge City, Louisiana]], holds an annual Gumbo Festival.<ref name=theriot34>Theriot (2009), p. 34.</ref> The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3&nbsp;ft (0.9 m) deep and {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter.

Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored [[Stock (food)|stock]], meat or [[shellfish]], a [[Thickening agent#Food|thickener]], and what Louisianians call the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|\"Holy Trinity\" of vegetables]], namely [[celery]], [[bell pepper]]s, and [[onion]]s. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether [[okra]] or [[fil\u00e9 powder]] (dried and ground [[Sassafras albidum|sassafras]] leaves). \n\nGumbo can be made with or without okra or fil\u00e9 powder. The preferred method in the historical [[Cuisine of New Orleans|New Orleans variation]] is with a French dark [[roux]]. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures.  [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, fil\u00e9, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine. [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or [[fowl]]. [[Sausage]] or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over [[rice]]. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked [[leaf vegetable|greens]].\n\nThe dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, German, and [[Choctaw]]. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish [[bouillabaisse]], or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the [[United States Senate]] dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator [[Allen Ellender]]. The popularity of chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the dish comes from [[Louisiana French]]. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the [[etymology]] of the word \"gumbo\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or fil\u00e9. In the [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] spoken by many [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as ''ki ngombo'' or ''quingombo''; the word is akin to the [[Umbundu]] ''ochingg\u00f4mbo'' and the [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]] ''chingg\u00f4mb\u00f4'' \"okra\". In the language of the native [[Choctaw]] people, fil\u00e9, or ground [[sassafras]] leaves, was called ''kombo''.<ref name=nobles98>Nobles (2009), p. 98.</ref><ref name=usner46/><ref>{{citation|editor-last=Babcock Gove|editor-first=Philip|title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary|editor-link=Philip Babcock Gove|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1986|isbn=0-85229-503-0|page=1011|chapter=gumbo|volume=2|title-link=Webster's Third New International Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{quote box|quote=Gumbo is a veritable art form in Louisiana.

If added during the boiling process, fil\u00e9 makes the gumbo too [[wikt:ropy|ropey]];<ref name=gutierrez57/> when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.<ref name=davidson126/>\n\nRoux has become the most popular thickener,<ref name=davidson126>Davidson and Jain (2006), p. 126.</ref> made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog [[lard]], although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century<ref name=nobles113>Nobles (2009), p. 113.</ref>). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains.  A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.<ref name=nobles113/>\n\n===Cajun vs. Creole gumbo===\n[[File:Cajun seafood gumbo.jpg|left|thumb|Cajun seafood gumbo]]\n[[File:Seafood Creole Gumbo.jpg|right|thumb|Creole seafood gumbo]]\nGumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in [[Cuisine of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and southeastern Louisiana are known as \"Creole\" after the [[Louisiana Creole people]], descendants of French and Spanish settlers, and enslaved African people, who lived in those areas. \"Cajun\" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by [[Cajun]]s, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from [[Acadia]] (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]) in the mid-18th century.<ref name=nobles107/><ref name=broussard-marin>{{citation |last=Broussard-Marin |first=Lydia |last2=Hynak-Hankinson |first2=Mary Therese |title=Ethnic food: the use of Cajun cuisine as a model |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |date=August 1989 |volume=89 |issue=8 |url=http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |page=1117&ndash;1121 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234453/http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGumbo is usually identified by its dark roux,<ref name=nobles111/> cooked until it is a color \"a few shades from burning\".<ref name=nobles113/> The roux is used with okra or fil\u00e9 powder.<ref name=nobles111/>  Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage.<ref name=nobles111/><ref name=gutierrez55and56/>  The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish.<ref name=nobles111/>  Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.<ref name=nobles111/>\n\nCreole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener.<ref name=nobles107/>  Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.<ref name=nobles113/>\n\n===Gumbo z'herbes===\n[[File:Zherbes.jpg|right|thumb|Gumbo z'herbes, served with [[fil\u00e9 powder]] and hot sauce]]\nWhen Catholics were expected to [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|abstain from eating meat]] during [[Lent]], a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from ''gumbo aux herbes'', or \"gumbo of greens\"), was often served.<ref name=williams160>Williams (2012), p. 160</ref> This variety combined varied [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] &ndash; typically including [[turnip]]s, [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], and [[spinach]].<ref name=gutierrez57>Gutierrez (1992), p. 57.</ref>  The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived together within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. This fostered an environment in which cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.<ref name=\"brasseaux134\">Brasseaux (1987), p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=The dish personifies the word 'Creole'; like its human counterparts, gumbo was born in the New World and took cues from the old but adapted to the new.|width=30%|align=left|source= \u2014  Cynthia Lejeune Nobles<ref name=nobles98/>}}\n\nThe establishment of [[New Orleans]] in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=hall159>Hall (1992), p. 159.</ref> French settlers allied with various native tribes including the [[Choctaw]], [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]], and [[Cherokee]],<ref name=hall19>Hall (1992), p. 19.</ref><ref name=bienvenue134/> from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.<ref name=hall14>Hall (1992), p. 14.</ref>\n\nSlave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719.

From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans.<ref name=nobles102/> Louisiana was secretly returned to France [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|in 1800]], then [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.\n\nBy 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra,<ref name=brasseaux135>Brasseaux (1987), p. 135.</ref> and hot pepper plants which likely came from [[Haiti]].<ref name=nobles103>Nobles (2009), p. 103.</ref> Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions.<ref name=bienvenue134/> Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.<ref name=nobles105>Nobles (2009), p. 105.</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nScholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century,<ref name=nobles98/> but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food.<ref name=usner46>Usner (2000), p. 46.</ref> Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.<ref name=bienvenue134>Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 134.</ref>\n\nAs aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American Caribbean and German influence. [[African Americans|African-American]] slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.<ref name=\"Hicks, Derek S. 2014\">Hicks, Derek S. \"An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion\". In Religion, Food, and Eating in North America, edited by Benjamin E. Zeller, Marie W. Dallam, Reid L. Neilson, and Nora L. Rubel, 134-154. New York: Columbia University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\nWest Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups.<ref name=\"bienvenue134\" /> Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.<ref name=\"nobles100\">Nobles (2009), p. 100.</ref>\n\nGumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew [[bouillabaisse]].<ref name=\"gutierrez54\" /><ref name=\"nobles99\" /> During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups,<ref name=\"brasseaux134\" /> using whatever ingredients were readily available.<ref name=\"nobles103\" /> When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage.<ref name=\"brasseaux134\" /> In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.<ref name=\"gutierrez54\" />\n\nSome culinary experts in the early 20th century, including [[Celestine Eustis]], maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes.<ref name=nobles99/> This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn [[grits]], a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and fil\u00e9 powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.<ref name=nobles100/>\n\nThese theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine &ndash; rice, shrimp, crawfish, and fil\u00e9 powder.<ref name=nobles99>Nobles (2009), p. 99.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, [[John Sibley (doctor)|John Sibley]] described \"the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop {{sic}} & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.\"<ref name=nobles104q>quoted in Nobles (2009), p. 104.</ref> The following year, French governor [[Pierre Clement de Laussat]] hosted a soir\u00e9e in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events \"give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined\".<ref name=nobles104/>\n\nAn 1824 cookbook, [[Mary Randolph]]'s ''The Virginia House-Wife'', was the first to include a recipe for gumbo.  Called \"Gumbo&nbsp;\u2013 A West India Dish\", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for \"Ochra Soup\" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish [[callaloo]].<ref name=nobles106>Nobles (2009), p. 106.</ref>\n\nA more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree.  Her ''Housekeeping in Old Virginia'' described \"Gumbo Filit A La Creole\", a fil\u00e9-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with [[allspice]], cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme.<ref name=nobles106/> The 1881 cookbook ''[[What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking]]'', dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. \"Oyster Gumbo Soup\" used a fil\u00e9 base, while \"Ochra Gumbo\" and \"Chicken Gumbo\" used okra as a base.<ref name=nobles106/> Four years later, the cookbook ''La Cuisine Creole'' documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.<ref name=nobles102/>\n\nUntil the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]. It gained a broader profile after the death of [[United States Senator]] [[Allen Ellender]]. A native of [[Terrebonne Parish, LA|Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]], Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef [[Paul Prudhomme]]'s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.<ref name=nobles114>Nobles (2009), p. 114.</ref>\n\n==Preparation and serving==\nGumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called ''cooked down''), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water or [[Stock (food)|stock]], then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached.<ref name=gutierrez57/> Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[thyme]], [[hot sauce]], and salt, are added to taste.<ref name=broussard-marin/>  According to Nobles, \"proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art\".<ref name=nobles103/> Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added last.<ref name=gutierrez57/>\n\nCreole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice,<ref name=\"bienvenue134\"/> which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people.<ref name=gutierrez56/> Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side.<ref name=gutierrez57/> Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a [[tureen]] on the table.<ref name=nobles112>Nobles (2009), p. 112.</ref> Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal,<ref name=gutierrez54>Gutierrez (1992), p. 54.</ref> although many Cajun families provide a side dish of [[potato salad]].<ref name=nobles111/> Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.<ref name=gutierrez54/>\n\nSoniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.<ref name=Soniat13>Soniat (1980), p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Social aspects==\nIn ''Cajun Foodways'', C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as \"an economical dish\" useful for \"feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood\".<ref name=gutierrez56/>  Nobles concurs that \"one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd\".<ref name=nobles105/>  With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.  The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.<ref name=gutierrez56/>\n\nSince the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.<ref name=bienvenue135>Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 135.</ref><ref name=brasseaux135/>  Local [[fais do-do]] (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight.<ref name=nobles105/>  Many families \"have a gumbo\", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.<ref name=bienvenue135/>\n\nGumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.\n\nIn rural [[Acadiana]] in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of [[Mardi Gras]] celebrations.  On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as [[courir de Mardi Gras]].<ref name=\"nobles105\" /> Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo.  When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when [[Lent]] begins.<ref name=\"nobles106\">Nobles (2009), p. 106.</ref>\n\nGumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.<ref name=nobles98/> Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo,<ref name=bienvenue135/> and it is a central feature of many local festivals.<ref name=gutierrez114>Gutierrez (1992), p. 114.</ref> The self-described \"Gumbo Capital of the World\", [[Bridge City, Louisiana]], holds an annual Gumbo Festival.<ref name=theriot34>Theriot (2009), p. 34.</ref> The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3&nbsp;ft (0.9 m) deep and {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter.
