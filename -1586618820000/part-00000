The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

There was a general feeling of agreement that the sacrifices were for the national good during the war.\n\nThe labor market changed radically. Peacetime conflicts concerning race and labor took on a special dimension because of the pressure for national unity. The Hollywood film industry was important for propaganda. Every aspect of life from politics to personal savings changed when put on a wartime footing. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low to high productivity jobs in industrial centers. Millions of students, retirees, housewives, and unemployed moved into the active labor force. The hours they had to work increased dramatically as the time for leisure activities declined sharply.\n\nGasoline, meat, and clothing were tightly rationed. Most families were allocated {{convert|3|USgal}} of gasoline a week, which sharply curtailed driving for any purpose. Production of most durable goods, like new housing, vacuum cleaners, and kitchen appliances, was banned until the war ended.<ref>Schneider, Carl G and Schneider, Dorothy; ''World War II''; p. 57 {{ISBN|1438108907}}</ref> In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled. Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war.<ref>Harold G. Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II'' (1988) pp. 27-31</ref><ref>David Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945'' (2001) pp. 615-68</ref>\n\n==Controls and taxes==\nFederal tax policy was highly contentious during the war, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] opposing a [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. However, both sides agreed on the need for high taxes (along with heavy borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from 81%-94% for the duration of the war, and the income level subject to the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250,<ref>Frankin Roosevelt, ''Executive Order 9250 Establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization.'' http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16171#axzz1qK2AszpJ</ref> to impose a 100% surtax on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1943}}}} today). However, Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on executive pay in corporations with government contracts.<ref>Carola Frydman  and Raven Molloy, \"Pay Cuts for the Boss: Executive Compensation in the 1940s,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 72 (March 2012), 225\u201351.</ref> Congress also enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).<ref>Geoffrey Perrett, ''Days of sadness, months of triumph: the American people, 1939-1945: Volume 1'' (1985) p. 300</ref>\n\nMany controls were put on the economy. The most important was price controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the [[Office of Price Administration]]. Wages were also controlled.<ref>Harvey C Mansfield, ''A short history of OPA'' (Historical reports on War Administration) (1951)</ref> Corporations dealt with numerous agencies, especially the [[War Production Board]] (WPB), and the War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940-1945'' (2004) pp. 498-517</ref>\n{{Main|Rationing in the United States#World War II}}\n[[File:Sugar rationing - NARA - 535570.jpg|thumb|200px|Sugar rationing]]\nIn 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the [[Combined Food Board]] was set up to coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government-issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.\n\nTo get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the [[1942 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]] which was canceled from 1942 to 1945. Sightseeing driving was banned.\n\n==Personal savings==\n\nPersonal income was at an all-time high, and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase. This was [[hyperinflation|a recipe for economic disaster]] that was largely avoided because Americans\u2014persuaded daily by their government to do so\u2014were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in [[war bonds]] that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges\u2014an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid \u00be of the face value of a war bond and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation.<ref>Inflation existed because not all prices were controlled, and even when they were prices rose as \"sales\" disappeared, low-end items were less available, and quality deteriorated.</ref> Americans were challenged to put \"at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds\".

Out of a labor force of 54 million, unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 (when the first accurate statistics were compiled) to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall 1942, hitting an all-time low of 700,000 in fall 1944.<ref>WPA workers were counted as unemployed.

Roosevelt stated that the efforts of civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves. \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" became the symbol of women laboring in manufacturing. The war effort brought about significant changes in the role of women in society as a whole. When the male breadwinner returned, wives could stop working. At the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs, women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service. However, the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the number in 1944, leaving 13% who lost or quit their jobs. Many women working in machinery factories and more were taken out of the workforce. Many of these former factory workers found other work at kitchens, being teachers, etc.\n\nThe table shows the development of the United States (cool development) labor force by sex during the war years.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) Chapter D, Labor, Series D 29-41</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Total labor force (*1000)\n!of which Male (*1000)\n!of which Female (*1000)\n!Female share of total (%)\n|-\n|1940 ||56,100 ||41,940 ||14,160|| 25.2\n|-\n|1941 ||57,720 ||43,070 ||14,650|| 25.4\n|-\n|1942 ||60,330 ||44,200 ||16,120|| 26.7\n|-\n|1943 ||64,780 ||45,950 ||18,830|| 29.1\n|-\n|1944 ||66,320 ||46,930 ||19,390|| 29.2\n|-\n|1945 ||66,210 ||46,910 ||19,304|| 29.2\n|-\n|1946 ||60,520 ||43,690 ||16,840|| 27.8\n|-\n|}\n\nWomen also took on new roles in sport and entertainment, which opened to them as more and more men were drafted. The [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] [AAGPBL] was the creation of Chicago Cubs owner [[Philip K. Wrigley|Philip Wrigley]], who sought alternative ways to expand his baseball franchise as top male players left for military service. In 1943, he created an eight-team League in small industrial cities around the Great Lakes; team names included the Kenosha Comets, the Rockford Peaches, and the Fort Wayne Daisies. Night games offered affordable, patriotic entertainment to working Americans who had flocked to wartime jobs in the Midwest hubs of Chicago and Detroit (although better paid than in the prewar Depression, most industrial war workers were on gas and tire rationing, limiting them to local recreation options.) The League provided a novelty entertainment of girls who played hardball as well as men, executing traditional baseball skills of sliding and double-plays while wearing short, feminine uniform skirts. Players as young as fifteen were recruited from farm families and urban industrial teams, chaperoned on the road and subject to strict rules of behavior that included mandatory makeup and feminine hair styling, no drinking or smoking, no swearing, no fraternization with men, and no wearing pants in public; moreover, the League only recruited white players. Fans supported the League to the extent that it continued well past the conclusion of the war, lasting through 1953. During the 1980s, the League was formally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and became the subject of a popular 1994 film called [[A League of Their Own]].<ref>Susan Cahn, Coming On Strong.

Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time, many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies. Production was encouraged and prices and markets were under tight federal control.<ref>Walter W.

The lures of patriotism, adulthood, and money led many youths to drop out of school and take a defense job. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, and the number of students in public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6 million in 1944, like a million students\u2014and many teachers\u2014took jobs.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) table H-424</ref>\n\n===Labor unions===\n[[File:AlfredPalmerwelder1.jpg|thumb|200px|Welder making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Co., [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. June 1942.]]\nThe war mobilization changed the relationship of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) with both employers and the national government.<ref>Lichtenstein (2003)</ref> Both the CIO and the larger [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) grew rapidly in the war years.<ref>Philip Taft, ''The A.F. of L. from the Death of Gompers to the Merger'' (1959) pp. 204-33</ref>\n\nNearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However, the United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940, left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts but also the innumerable small strikes called by [[shop steward]]s and local union leadership to protest particular grievances. In return for labor's no-strike pledge, the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts. Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940-1945'' (2004) p. 410</ref>\n\nEven though the complaints from union members about the no-strike pledge became louder and more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The Mine Workers, by contrast, who did not belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine leader [[John L. Lewis]] a much-hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions.<ref>Melvyn Dubofsky and Warren Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography'' (1977) pp. 415-44</ref>\n\nAll the major unions grew stronger during the war. The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of [[union security]], through arbitration and negotiation. Employers gave workers new untaxed benefits (such as vacation time, pensions, and health insurance), which increased real incomes even when wage rates were frozen.<ref>William H. Holley et al. ''The Labor Relations Process'' (2008) p. 63</ref> The wage differential between higher-skilled and less-skilled workers narrowed, and with the enormous increase in overtime for blue-collar wage workers (at time and a half pay), incomes in working-class households shot up, while the salaried middle class lost ground.\n\n[[File: Workers on the Liberator Bombers, Consolidated Aircraft Corp fsac.1a34948u.jpg|thumb|200px|Workers at [[Consolidated Aircraft]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]], 1942.]]\nThe experience of bargaining on a national basis, while restraining local unions from striking, also tended to accelerate the trend toward bureaucracy within the larger CIO unions. Some, such as the Steelworkers, had always been centralized organizations in which authority for major decisions resided at the top. The UAW, by contrast, had always been a more grassroots organization, but it also started to try to rein in its maverick local leadership during these years.<ref>Martin Glaberman, ''Wartime Strikes: The Struggle Against the No Strike Pledge in the UAW During World War II'' (1980)</ref> The CIO also had to confront deep racial divides in its membership, particularly in the UAW plants in [[Detroit]] where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs, but also in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in further left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU, and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes, to educate their membership, and to support the Roosevelt Administration's tentative efforts to remedy racial discrimination in war industries through the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]]. Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL.<ref>Andrew Kersten, ''Race, Jobs, and the War: The FEPC in the Midwest, 1941-46'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe CIO unions were progressive in dealing with [[gender discrimination]] in the wartime industry, which now employed many more women workers in nontraditional jobs. Unions that had represented large numbers of women workers before the war, such as the UE (electrical workers) and the [[International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association|Food and Tobacco Workers]], had fairly good records of fighting discrimination against women. Most union leaders saw women as temporary wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces. The wages of these women needed to be kept high so that the veterans would get high wages.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' ch 5</ref>\n\n==The South in wartime==\nThe war marked a time of dramatic change in the poor, heavily rural South as new industries and military bases were developed by the Federal government, providing badly needed capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region's many bases and new industries.  During and after the war millions of hard-scrabble farmers, both white and black, left agriculture for urban jobs.<ref>Morton Sosna, and James C. Cobb, ''Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South'' (UP of Mississippi, 1997).</ref><ref>Ralph C.

Hoover and B.U. Ratchford, ''Economic Resources and Policies of the South'' (1951).</ref>\n\nUnited States began mobilizing for war in a major way in the spring of 1940. The warm sunny weather of the South proved ideal for building 60 percent of the Army's new training camps and nearly half the new airfields, In all 40 percent of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example, sleepy [[Starke, Florida]], a town of 1500 people in 1940, became the base of [[Camp Blanding]]. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers.  Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built In Virginia, Charleston, and along the Gulf Coast. Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia. The most secret and expensive operation was at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], were unlimited amounts of locally generated electricity were used to prepare uranium for the atom bomb.<ref>Russell B. Olwell, ''At Work in the Atomic City: A Labor and Social History of Oak Ridge, Tennessee'' (2004.</ref> The number of production workers doubled during the war. Most training centers, factories and shipyards were closed in 1945 and the families that left hardscrabble farms often remained to find jobs in the urban South. The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as [[George B. Tindall]] notes, the transformation was, \"The demonstration of industrial potential, new habits of mind, and a recognition that industrialization demanded community services.\"<ref>Dewey W.

It became the first duty of civilians recruited for the local civilian defense to ensure that [[Blackout (wartime)|lights were either off or thick curtains drawn over all windows at night]].\n\n[[State Guard#Origins|State Guards]] were reformed for internal security duties to replace the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] who were federalized and sent overseas. The [[Civil Air Patrol]] was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary|Coast Guard Auxiliary]], used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was to remind people that there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could hope to reach.<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell</ref>\n\nThe [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) was founded in 1941 in response to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to uniformed military personnel.

Other women previously employed only in the home, or in traditionally female work, took jobs in factories that directly supported the war effort or filled jobs vacated by men who had entered military service.

It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It involved questions as to who should control the draft, the size of the army, and the need for deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them. There was very little draft resistance.<ref>Flynn (1993)</ref>\n\nThe nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. The industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940\u201343 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps to increase production. Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be recalled to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed essential. There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries. Working men who had been classified [[4F (military conscription)|4F]] or otherwise ineligible for the draft took second jobs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn the figure below an overview of the development of the United States labor force, the armed forces and unemployment during the war years.<ref>the US Bureau of the Census; Bicentennial edition, Part 2, Chapter D, Labor, Series D 1-10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Total labor force (*1000)\n!Armed forces (*1000)\n!Unemployed (*1000)\n!Unemployment rate (%)\n|-\n|1939 ||55,588 ||370 ||9,480|| 17.2\n|-\n|1940 ||56,180 ||540 ||8,120|| 14.6\n|-\n|1941 ||57,530 ||1,620 ||5,560|| 9.9\n|-\n|1942 ||60,380 ||3,970 ||2,660|| 4.7\n|-\n|1943 ||64,560 ||9,020 ||1,070|| 1.9\n|-\n|1944 ||66,040 ||11,410 ||670|| 1.2\n|-\n|1945 ||65,290 ||11,430 ||1,040|| 1.9\n|-\n|1946 ||60,970 ||3,450 ||2,270|| 3.9\n|-\n|}\n\nOne contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers, which was avoided as much as possible. The drafting of 18-year-olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion. Racial minorities were drafted at the same rate as Whites and were paid the same, but blacks were kept in all-black units. The experience of World War I regarding men needed by industry was particularly unsatisfactory\u2014too many skilled mechanics and engineers became privates (there is a possibly apocryphal story of a ''banker'' assigned as a ''baker'' due to a clerical error, noted by historian Lee Kennett in his book \"G.I.\") Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments (many volunteered anyway, but those who stayed at home lost postwar veteran's benefits.)\n\nLater in the war, in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France in 1944, many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the 1930s, pacifism was a very strong force in most of the Protestant churches. Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V]]\" campaign of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref>John  P.

The pacifist churches such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service, though many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joined the military. Unlike in 1917-1918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. The [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]] had a strong pacifist element reaching a high point in the late 1930s. This small Fundamentalist Protestant denomination regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked.<ref>Mitchell K. Hall, 'A Withdrawal from Peace: The Historical Response to War of the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana),' ''Journal of Church and State'' (1985) 27#2 pp. 301-314</ref> Likewise, the Quakers generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors.<ref>Thomas D.

These churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. [[Goshen College]] set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although young women pacifists were not eligible for the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941-1947'' (1997) pp. 98-111</ref> The [[Jehovah Witness]] denomination, however, refused to participate in any forms of service, and thousands of its young men refused to register and went to prison.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]] was already tracking elements that were suspected of loyalty to Germany, Japan, or Italy, and many were arrested in the weeks after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. 7,000 German and Italian aliens (who were not U.S. citizens) were moved back from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], along with some 100,000 of Japanese descent. Some enemy aliens were held without trial during the entire war. The U.S. citizens accused of supporting Germany were given public trials, and often were freed.<ref>Geoffrey Perrett, ''Days of sadness, years of triumph: the American people, 1939-1945: Volume 1'' (1985) p. 218, 366</ref><ref>Michal R.

Millions of wives followed their husbands to military camps; for many families, especially from farms, the moves were permanent. One 1944 survey of migrants in [[Portland, Oregon]] and San Diego found that three quarters wanted to stay after the war.<ref name=\"tuttle195\">{{cite book | title=Daddy's Gone to War: The Second World War in the Lives of America's Children | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Tuttle, William M.

Large numbers of African Americans left the cotton fields and headed for the cities. Housing was increasingly difficult to find in industrial centers, as there was no new non-military construction. Commuting by car was limited by gasoline rationing. People carpooled or took public transportation, which was severely overcrowded. Trains were heavily booked, with uniformed military personnel taking priority, so people limited vacation and long-distance travel.\n\n===Racial tensions===\nThe large-scale movement of black Americans from the rural South to urban and defense centers in the North and the West (and some in the South) during the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] led to local confrontations over jobs and housing shortages. The cities were relatively peaceful; much-feared large-scale race riots did not happen, but there was nevertheless violence on both sides, as in the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|1943 race riot in Detroit]] and the anti-Mexican [[Zoot Suit Riots]] in Los Angeles in 1943.<ref>Walter C. Rucker and James N. Upton, ''Encyclopedia of American race riots'' (2006) pp xxix to xli, 222, 225, 478</ref> The \"zoot suit\" was a highly conspicuous costume worn by Mexican American teenagers in Los Angeles. As historian Roger Bruns notes, \"the Zoot suit also represented a stark visual expression of culture for Mexican Americans, about making a statement\u2014a mark of defiance against the place in society in which they found themselves.\" They gained admiration from within their in-group, and \"disgust and ridicule from others, especially the Anglos.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Bruns|title=Zoot Suit Riots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY2OAwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1|isbn=9780313398797}}</ref>\n\n==Role of women==\n{{Further|American women in World War II}}\n[[File: Riveting team2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Riveting team working on the cockpit shell of a [[C-47]] transport at the plant of [[North American Aviation]].

Meanwhile, the public sphere\u2014the male domain\u2014was redefined as the international stage of military action.<ref>Alecea Standlee, \"Shifting Spheres: Gender, Labor and the Construction of National Identity in U.S. Propaganda during the Second World War,\" ''Minerva Journal of Women & War'' Spring 2010, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 43-62</ref>\n\n===Employment===\nWartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor for women, as young able-bodied men were sent overseas and wartime manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\">{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan |date=1982 |title=Home Front and Beyond: American Women in the 1940s |url=https://archive.org/details/homefrontbeyonda00hartrich|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=Twayne Publishers |page= |isbn=}}</ref> This was catalyzed by the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" phenomenon.\n\nThe composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed considerably throughout the war. One in every ten married women entered the labor force during the war, and they represented more than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the nation's history, there were more married women than single women in the female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women were employed at some time during that year at the height of wartime production.<ref name=\" Hartmann 1982\"/> In the same year the unemployment rate hit an all-time historical low of 1.2%.<ref>Tassava, Christopher. [http://eh.net/?s=tassava \"The American Economy during World War II\"]. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. February 10, 2008. URL http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/</ref>\n\nAccording to Hartmann (1982), the women who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time suggests that financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice as likely to seek jobs.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/>\n\nFundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as \"men's work;\" however, the work women did was typically catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity.<ref name=milkman>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |author-link1=Ruth Milkman |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation by Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatworkdyna0000milk |url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=978-0252013577}}</ref> For example, in a [[Sperry Gyroscope Company|Sperry Corporation]] recruitment pamphlet the company stated, \"Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press.\" A [[Ford Motor Company]] at [[Willow Run]] bomber plant publication proclaimed, \"The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters.\" One manager was even stated saying, \"Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles, and darning needles all their lives?\"<ref name=milkman /> In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.\n\nFollowing the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]] (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant) worker in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]] confessed, \"I will gladly get back into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all my life. It was just to help out during the war.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kenney |first=Dave |date=2005 |title=Minnesota at Work |url= |location=St. Paul |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Other women were laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not lose their seniority due to the war.\n\nThere are a few examples of reluctance of women to take on wartime jobs. For example, due to labour shortages the American government had to actively promote the war to civilians and the [[War Manpower Commission]] used propaganda to sell the war to American women. There was a change in attitudes regarding women in employment in wartime America, and the government started to promote women in work as part of nature, and those that resisted or were reluctant to find work were slackers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mobalizing Women for War: German and American Propaganda, 1939-1945|last=Rupp|first=Leila J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=91\u201397}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not return. This left women to take up the sole responsibility of the household and provide economically for the family.\n\n===Nursing===\n\nNursing became a highly prestigious occupation for young women. A majority of female civilian nurses volunteered for the [[Nurse Corps (United States Army)|Army Nurse Corps]] or the [[the United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy Nurse Corps]]. These women automatically became officers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.med-dept.com/anc.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223023548/http://med-dept.com/anc.php |archive-date=2009-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Teenaged girls enlisted in the [[Cadet Nurse Corps]].

Winchell 2008\"/> and the [[Red Cross]].<ref>Foster Rhea Dulles, ''The American Red Cross, a History'' (1950)</ref> Unorganized women were encouraged to collect and turn in materials that were needed by the war effort. Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also created rubber band balls, which they contributed to the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.\n\nThe [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying a warplane had always been a male role. No American women flew warplanes in combat.<ref>Molly Merryman, ''Clipped Wings: The Rise and Fall of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS) of World War II'' (2001)</ref>\n\n===Baby boom===\nMarriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who had postponed marriage. The birth rate started shooting up in 1941, paused in 1944\u201345 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the \"[[Baby Boom]]\".\n\nIn a [[New Deal]]-like move, the federal government set up the \"EMIC\" program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant.\n\nHousing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little housing had been built in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] years, so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1949 when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand. (After 1944 much of the new housing was supported by the [[G.I. Bill]].)\n\nFederal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range terms, divorce rates changed little.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n===Housewives===\n[[File: Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum July 2015 44 (World War II American home front diorama).jpg|thumb|A World War II American home front diorama, depicting a woman and her daughter, at the [[Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum]]]]\n\nJuggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.\n\nStress came when sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fianc\u00e9s were drafted and sent to faraway training camps, preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training camps.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n==Racial politics of the war==\n\n===Immigration policies during and after World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]] the trend in immigration policies was both more and less restrictive.

This Act was the first law in the United States that excluded a specific group- the Chinese from migrating to the United States.<ref name=\":0\" /> But during World War II, with the Chinese as allies, the United States passed the [[Magnuson Act]], also known as the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. There was also the [[Nationality Act of 1940]], which clarified how to become and remain a citizen.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, it allowed immigrants who were not citizens, like the Filipinos or those in the outside territories to gain citizenship by enlisting in the army.  In contrast, the Japanese and Japanese-Americans were subject to internment in the U.S. There was also legislation like the [[Smith Act]], also known as the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which required indicted communists, anarchists, and fascists. Another program was the [[Bracero program|Bracero Program]], which allowed over two decades, nearly 5 million Mexican workers to come and work in the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter World War II, there was also the [[Truman Directive of 1945]], which did not allow more people to migrate but did use the immigration quotas to let in more displaced people after the war.<ref>{{Cite web|title = United States Policy Toward Jewish Refugees, 1941\u20131952|url = http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007094|website = www.ushmm.org|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> There was also the War Brides Act of 1945, which allowed spouses of US soldiers to get an expedited path towards citizenship. In contrast, the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, also known as the [[McCarran-Walter Act]], turned away migrants based not on their country of origin but rather whether they are moral or diseased.<ref>{{Cite web|title = U.S. Immigration Legislation: 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (McCarran-Walter Act)|url = http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1952_immigration_and_nationality_act.html|website = library.uwb.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Internment===\n{{Main|Japanese American internment|Italian-American internment|German-American internment}}\nIn 1942 the War Department demanded that all enemy nationals be removed from war zones on the West Coast. The question became how to evacuate the estimated 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry living in [[California]]. Roosevelt looked at the secret evidence available to him:<ref>Keith Robar, ''Intelligence, Internment & Relocation: Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066: How Top Secret \"MAGIC\" Intelligence-Led to Evacuation'' (2000)</ref> the Japanese in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] had collaborated with the Japanese invasion troops; most of the adult Japanese in California had been strong supporters of Japan in the war against China. There was evidence of [[espionage]] compiled by [[Cryptanalysis|code-breakers]] that decrypted messages to Japan from agents in North America and [[Hawaii]] before and after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. These [[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]] cables were kept a secret from all but those with the highest clearance, such as Roosevelt. On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 9066]] which set up designated military areas \"from which any or all persons may be excluded.\" The most controversial part of the order included American born children and youth who had dual U.S. and Japanese citizenship. Germans and Italians were not interned, as shown from the ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' case.\n\nIn February 1943, when activating the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]]\u2014a unit composed mostly of American-born American citizens of Japanese descent living in Hawaii\u2014Roosevelt said, \"No loyal citizen of the United States should be denied the democratic right to exercise the responsibilities of his citizenship, regardless of his ancestry. The principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart; Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry.\" In 1944, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the legality of the executive order in the ''Korematsu v. United States'' case. The executive order remained in force until December when Roosevelt released the Japanese internees, except for those who announced their intention to return to Japan.\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]] was an official enemy, and citizens of Italy were also forced away from \"strategic\" coastal areas in [[California]]. Altogether, 58,000 Italians were forced to relocate. They relocated on their own and were not put in camps. Known spokesmen for [[Benito Mussolini]] were arrested and held in prison. The restrictions were dropped in October 1942, and Italy switched sides in 1943 and became an American ally. In the east, however, the large Italian populations of the northeast, especially in munitions-producing centers such as [[Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven]], faced no restrictions and contributed just as much to the war effort as other Americans.\n\n===FEPC===\nThe [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]] (FEPC) was a federal executive order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate based on race or religion. It assisted African Americans in obtaining defense industry jobs during the second wave of the Great Migration of southern blacks to Northern and Western war production and urban centers. Under pressure from [[A. Philip Randolph|A. Philip Randolph's]] growing March on Washington Movement, on June 25, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) by signing [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 8802. It said, \"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin\". In 1943 Roosevelt greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order, #9346. It required that all government contracts have a non-discrimination clause.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The FEPC and the legacy of the labor-based Civil Rights Movement of the 1940s|journal = Labor History|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 0023-656X|pages = 71\u201392|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00236560701740093|first = Kevin M.|last = Schultz}}</ref> FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and women on the job front. During the war, the federal government operated airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other facilities that employed millions. FEPC rules applied and guaranteed equality of employment rights. These facilities shut down when the war ended. In the private sector, the FEPC was generally successful in enforcing non-discrimination in the North and West but did not attempt to challenge segregation in the South, and in the border region, its intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers.<ref>Garfinkel</ref>\n\n===African Americans and the Double V campaign===\n{{Main|Double V campaign}}\n[[File:\"V\" home campaign, Washington, DC, 10-1942 - NARA - 533827.tif|thumb|200px|Participants in the Double V campaign, 1942.

During the second phase of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], five million African-Americans relocated from rural and poor Southern farms to urban and munitions centers in Northern and Western states in search of racial, economic, social, and political opportunities. Racial tensions remained high in these cities, particularly in overcrowding in housing as well as competition for jobs. As a result, cities such as [[1943 Detroit race riot|Detroit]], [[Harlem Riot of 1943|New York]], and [[Zoot Suit Riots|Los Angeles]] experienced [[race riot]]s in 1943, leading to dozens of deaths.<ref>Robert Shogan and Tom Craig, ''The Detroit Race Riot: A Study in Violence'' (1976)</ref> Black newspapers created the Double V campaign to build black morale and head off radical action.<ref>Lee Finkle, 'The Conservative Aims of Militant Rhetoric: Black Protest during World War II',: ''Journal of American History,'' Dec 1973, Vol. 60 Issue 3, pp. 692-713 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1917685 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMost black women had been farm laborers or domestics before the war.<ref>Maureen Honey ''Bitter Fruit: African American Women in World War II'' (1999).</ref> Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these Black women fought a \"[[Double V campaign]]\" \u2014fighting against the Axis abroad and restrictive hiring practices at home.

For example, the comic book Captain America No. 1 features the titular superhero punching Hitler.  Similar anti-German sentiments existed in cartoons as well.  The Popeye cartoon, ''[[Seein' Red, White 'N' Blue|Seein' Red, White, 'N' Blue]]'' (aired on February 19, 1943), ends with Uncle Sam punching a sickly-looking Hitler.  In the Donald Duck cartoon ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'', Donald Duck is portrayed as a Nazi living in Germany, where the Nazi war effort is heavily satirized and caricatured.<ref>{{Citation|last=Solarer111|title=Donald Duck - Der Fuehrer's face {{!}} eng sub|date=2011-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn20oXFrxxg|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAmerican media portrayed the Japanese negatively as well. While attacks on Germans were generally focused on high-level Nazi officials such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, and G\u00f6ring, the Japanese were targeted more broadly.  Portrayals of the Japanese ranged from showing them being vicious and feral, as on the cover of Marvel Comic's Mystery Comics no. 32, to mocking their physical appearance and speech patterns.  In the Loony Tune's cartoon ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'' (aired May 13, 1943), the Japanese people are all shown to be dim-witted, obsessed with being polite, cowardly, and physically short with buckteeth, big lips, squinty eyes, and glasses.

[[Wendell Willkie]], the defeated GOP candidate in 1940, became a roving ambassador for Roosevelt. After Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] became enmeshed in a series of squabbles with other high officials, Roosevelt stripped him of his administrative responsibilities and dropped him from the 1944 ticket. Roosevelt in cooperation with big-city party leaders replaced Wallace with Missouri Senator [[Harry S. Truman]]. Truman was best known for investigating waste, fraud, and inefficiency in wartime programs.  In very light turnout in 1942, the Republicans made major gains. In the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]], Roosevelt defeated [[Tom Dewey]] in a race that attracted little attention.<ref>David M.

Inexpensive, accessible, and ever-present, the poster was an ideal agent for making war aims the personal mission of every citizen. Government agencies, businesses, and private organizations issued an array of poster images linking the military front with the home front\u2014calling upon every American to boost production at work and home. Some resorted to extreme racial and ethnic caricatures of the enemy, sometimes as hopelessly bumbling cartoon characters, sometimes as evil, half-human creatures.<ref>The [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Minnesota]] all have extensive collections of World War II posters accessible online.</ref>\n\n===Bond drives===\nA strong aspect of American culture then as now was a fascination with celebrities, and the government used them in its eight war bond campaigns that called on people to save now (and redeem the bonds after the war, when houses, cars, and appliances would again be available).<ref>{{cite book|author=James J.

Hollywood had military units that made training films \u2013 [[Ronald Reagan]] narrated many of them. Nearly all of Hollywood made hundreds of war movies that, in coordination with the [[Office of War Information]] (OWI), taught Americans what was happening and who the heroes and the villains were. Ninety million people went to the movies every week.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert L. McLaughlin|author2=Sally E. Parry|title=We'll Always Have the Movies: American Cinema During World War II|url=https://archive.org/details/wellalwayshavemo00mcla|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=U.P. of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813171371}}</ref> Some of the most highly regarded films during this period included  ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]]'', ''[[Going My Way]]'', and ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]''. Even before active American involvement in the war, the popular [[Three Stooges]] comic trio were lampooning the Nazi German leadership, and Nazis in general, with a number of [[short subject]] films, starting with ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' released in January 1940 - the very first Hollywood film of any length to satirize Hitler and the Nazis<ref>[http://www.threestooges.net/filmography/episode/44 ''You Nazty Spy!'' at threestooges.net]</ref> - nearly two years before the United States was drawn into World War II.\n\nCartoons and short subjects were a major sign of the times, as [[Warner Brothers Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney Studios]] gave unprecedented aid to the war effort by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous, and also contributed to remind movie-goers of wartime activities such as rationing and scrap drives, war bond purchases, and the creation of [[victory garden]]s. Warner shorts such as ''[[Daffy - The Commando]]'', ''[[Draftee Daffy]]'', ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'', and ''[[Russian Rhapsody (film)|Russian Rhapsody]]'' are particularly remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy (particularly [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]). Their cartoons of [[Private Snafu]], produced for the military as \"training films\", served to remind many military men of the importance of following proper procedure during wartime, for their safety. [[Hanna-Barbera]] also contributed to the war effort with slyly pro-US short cartoon [[The Yankee Doodle Mouse]] with \"Lt.\" [[Jerry Mouse]] as the hero and [[Tom Cat]] as the \"enemy\".\n\nTo heighten the suspense, Hollywood needed to feature attacks on American soil and obtained inspirations for dramatic stories from the Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines became a \"homefront\" that showed the American way of life threatened by the Japanese enemy. Especially popular were the films ''[[Texas to Bataan]]'' (1942), ''[[Corregidor (1943 film)|Corregidor]]'' (1943), ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943),  ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945), and ''[[Back to Bataan]]'' (1945).<ref>Camilla Fojas, 'Foreign Domestics: The Filipino \"Homefront\" in World War II Hollywood,' ''Comparative American Studies'' (March 2010) 8#1 pp. 3-21.</ref>\n\nThe OWI had to approve every film before they could be exported. To facilitate the process the OWI's Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP) worked with producers, directors, and writers before the shooting started to make sure that the themes reflected patriotic values. While Hollywood had been generally nonpolitical before the war, the liberals who controlled OWI encouraged the expression of New Deal liberalism, bearing in mind the huge domestic audience, as well as an international audience that was equally large.<ref>Clayton R. Koppes and Gregory D. Black, 'What to Show the World: The Office of War Information and Hollywood, 1942-1945,' ''Journal of American History'' (1977) 64#1 pp. 87-105; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1888275 in JSTOR]; they report on p. 90, \"OWI demanded affirmation of New Deal liberalism for America and the world.\"</ref>\n\n===Censorship===\nThe [[Office of Censorship]] published a code of conduct for newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. The office did not use government censors to preapprove all articles and radio programs. It relied on voluntary cooperation to avoid subjects, such as troop movements, weather forecasts, and the travels of the President, that might aid the enemy. Journalists did not have to publish positive propaganda, unlike during World War I.\n\n==Local activism==\n<!--Linked to form [[Union Pacific Railroad#Union Pacific in the 20th Century]]-->\nOne way to enlist everyone in the war effort was scrap collection (called \"recycling\" decades later). Many everyday commodities were vital to the war effort, and drives were organized to recycle such products as rubber, tin, waste kitchen fats (raw material for explosives), newspaper, lumber, steel, and many others. Popular phrases promoted by the government at the time were \"Get into the scrap!\" and \"Get some cash for your trash\" (a nominal sum was paid to the donor for many kinds of scrap items) and [[Thomas \"Fats\" Waller]] even wrote and recorded a song with the latter title. Such commodities as rubber and tin remained highly important as recycled materials until the end of the war, while others, such as steel, were critically needed at first. War propaganda played a prominent role in many of these drives. Nebraska had perhaps the most extensive and well-organized drives; it was mobilized by the ''[[Omaha World Herald]]'' newspaper.<ref>James J. Kimble, 'The Militarization of the Prairie,' ''Great Plains Quarterly'' (2007) 27#2 pp. 83-99</ref>\n\n==Attacks on U.S. soil==\nAlthough the [[Axis powers]] never launched a full-scale [[invasion of the United States]], there were attacks and acts of sabotage on U.S. soil.\n* December 7, 1941 \u2013 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], a surprise attack that killed almost 2,500 people in the then incorporated territory of Hawaii which caused the U.S. to enter the war the next day.\n* January\u2013August 1942 \u2013 [[Second Happy Time]], German U-Boats engaged American ships off the U.S. East Coast.\n* February 23, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Ellwood]], a Japanese submarine attack on California.\n* March 4, 1942 \u2013 [[Operation K]], a Japanese reconnaissance over Pearl Harbor following the attack on December 7, 1941. \n* June 3, 1942 \u2013 August 15, 1943 \u2013 [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], the battle for the then incorporated territory of Alaska.\n* June 21\u201322, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Fort Stevens]], the second attack on a U.S. military base in the continental U.S. in World War II.\n* September 9, 1942, and September 29, 1942 \u2013 [[Lookout Air Raids]], the only attack by enemy aircraft on the U.S. mainland and the second enemy aircraft attack on the U.S. continent in World War II.\n* November 1944\u2013April 1945 \u2013 [[Fu-Go balloon bomb]]s, over 9,300 of them were launched by Japan across the Pacific Ocean towards the U.S. mainland to start forest fires.

There was a general feeling of agreement that the sacrifices were for the national good during the war.\n\nThe labor market changed radically. Peacetime conflicts concerning race and labor took on a special dimension because of the pressure for national unity. The Hollywood film industry was important for propaganda. Every aspect of life from politics to personal savings changed when put on a wartime footing. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low to high productivity jobs in industrial centers. Millions of students, retirees, housewives, and unemployed moved into the active labor force. The hours they had to work increased dramatically as the time for leisure activities declined sharply.\n\nGasoline, meat, and clothing were tightly rationed. Most families were allocated {{convert|3|USgal}} of gasoline a week, which sharply curtailed driving for any purpose. Production of most durable goods, like new housing, vacuum cleaners, and kitchen appliances, was banned until the war ended.<ref>Schneider, Carl G and Schneider, Dorothy; ''World War II''; p. 57 {{ISBN|1438108907}}</ref> In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled. Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war.<ref>Harold G. Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II'' (1988) pp. 27-31</ref><ref>David Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945'' (2001) pp. 615-68</ref>\n\n==Controls and taxes==\nFederal tax policy was highly contentious during the war, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] opposing a [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. However, both sides agreed on the need for high taxes (along with heavy borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from 81%-94% for the duration of the war, and the income level subject to the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250,<ref>Frankin Roosevelt, ''Executive Order 9250 Establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization.'' http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16171#axzz1qK2AszpJ</ref> to impose a 100% surtax on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1943}}}} today). However, Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on executive pay in corporations with government contracts.<ref>Carola Frydman  and Raven Molloy, \"Pay Cuts for the Boss: Executive Compensation in the 1940s,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 72 (March 2012), 225\u201351.</ref> Congress also enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).<ref>Geoffrey Perrett, ''Days of sadness, months of triumph: the American people, 1939-1945: Volume 1'' (1985) p. 300</ref>\n\nMany controls were put on the economy. The most important was price controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the [[Office of Price Administration]]. Wages were also controlled.<ref>Harvey C Mansfield, ''A short history of OPA'' (Historical reports on War Administration) (1951)</ref> Corporations dealt with numerous agencies, especially the [[War Production Board]] (WPB), and the War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940-1945'' (2004) pp. 498-517</ref>\n{{Main|Rationing in the United States#World War II}}\n[[File:Sugar rationing - NARA - 535570.jpg|thumb|200px|Sugar rationing]]\nIn 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the [[Combined Food Board]] was set up to coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government-issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.\n\nTo get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the [[1942 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]] which was canceled from 1942 to 1945. Sightseeing driving was banned.\n\n==Personal savings==\n\nPersonal income was at an all-time high, and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase. This was [[hyperinflation|a recipe for economic disaster]] that was largely avoided because Americans\u2014persuaded daily by their government to do so\u2014were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in [[war bonds]] that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges\u2014an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid \u00be of the face value of a war bond and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation.<ref>Inflation existed because not all prices were controlled, and even when they were prices rose as \"sales\" disappeared, low-end items were less available, and quality deteriorated.</ref> Americans were challenged to put \"at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds\". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special \"Minuteman\" flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the \"Ten Percent Club\". There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals.<ref>James J. Kimble, ''Mobilizing the Home Front: War Bonds And Domestic Propaganda'' (2006)</ref>\n\n==Labor==\n\nThe unemployment problem of the Great Depression ended with the mobilization for war. Out of a labor force of 54 million, unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 (when the first accurate statistics were compiled) to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall 1942, hitting an all-time low of 700,000 in fall 1944.<ref>WPA workers were counted as unemployed. U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Statistical Abstract: 1946'' (1946) p. 173</ref> There was a growing labor shortage in war centers, with sound trucks going street by street begging for people to apply for war jobs.\n\nGreater wartime production created millions of new jobs, while the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] reduced the number of young men available for civilian jobs. So great was the demand for labor that millions of retired people, housewives, and students entered the labor force, lured by patriotism and wages.<ref>Miller and Cornford</ref> The shortage of grocery clerks caused retailers to convert from service at the counter to self-service. With new shorter women clerks replacing taller men, some stores lowered shelves to {{convert|5|ft|8|in}}. Before the war, most groceries, dry cleaners, drugstores, and department stores offered home delivery service. The labor shortage and gasoline and tire rationing caused most retailers to stop delivery. They found that requiring customers to buy their products in person increased sales.<ref name=\"kennett1985\">{{cite book | title=For the duration... : the United States goes to war, Pearl Harbor-1942 | publisher=Scribner | author=Lee Kennett | year=1985 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-684-18239-1 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/fordurationunite00kenn/page/130 130\u201332] | url=https://archive.org/details/fordurationunite00kenn/page/130 }}</ref>\n\n===Women===\n\n[[File:Rosie the Riveter (Vultee) DS.jpg|200px|thumb|\"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\", working on an [[A-31 Vengeance|A-31 \"Vengeance\" dive bomber]], Tennessee, 1943.]]\n\nWomen also joined the workforce to replace men who had joined the forces, though in fewer numbers. Roosevelt stated that the efforts of civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves. \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" became the symbol of women laboring in manufacturing. The war effort brought about significant changes in the role of women in society as a whole. When the male breadwinner returned, wives could stop working. At the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs, women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service. However, the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the number in 1944, leaving 13% who lost or quit their jobs. Many women working in machinery factories and more were taken out of the workforce. Many of these former factory workers found other work at kitchens, being teachers, etc.\n\nThe table shows the development of the United States (cool development) labor force by sex during the war years.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) Chapter D, Labor, Series D 29-41</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Total labor force (*1000)\n!of which Male (*1000)\n!of which Female (*1000)\n!Female share of total (%)\n|-\n|1940 ||56,100 ||41,940 ||14,160|| 25.2\n|-\n|1941 ||57,720 ||43,070 ||14,650|| 25.4\n|-\n|1942 ||60,330 ||44,200 ||16,120|| 26.7\n|-\n|1943 ||64,780 ||45,950 ||18,830|| 29.1\n|-\n|1944 ||66,320 ||46,930 ||19,390|| 29.2\n|-\n|1945 ||66,210 ||46,910 ||19,304|| 29.2\n|-\n|1946 ||60,520 ||43,690 ||16,840|| 27.8\n|-\n|}\n\nWomen also took on new roles in sport and entertainment, which opened to them as more and more men were drafted. The [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] [AAGPBL] was the creation of Chicago Cubs owner [[Philip K. Wrigley|Philip Wrigley]], who sought alternative ways to expand his baseball franchise as top male players left for military service. In 1943, he created an eight-team League in small industrial cities around the Great Lakes; team names included the Kenosha Comets, the Rockford Peaches, and the Fort Wayne Daisies. Night games offered affordable, patriotic entertainment to working Americans who had flocked to wartime jobs in the Midwest hubs of Chicago and Detroit (although better paid than in the prewar Depression, most industrial war workers were on gas and tire rationing, limiting them to local recreation options.) The League provided a novelty entertainment of girls who played hardball as well as men, executing traditional baseball skills of sliding and double-plays while wearing short, feminine uniform skirts. Players as young as fifteen were recruited from farm families and urban industrial teams, chaperoned on the road and subject to strict rules of behavior that included mandatory makeup and feminine hair styling, no drinking or smoking, no swearing, no fraternization with men, and no wearing pants in public; moreover, the League only recruited white players. Fans supported the League to the extent that it continued well past the conclusion of the war, lasting through 1953. During the 1980s, the League was formally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and became the subject of a popular 1994 film called [[A League of Their Own]].<ref>Susan Cahn, Coming On Strong.

Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time, many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies. Production was encouraged and prices and markets were under tight federal control.<ref>Walter W. Wilcox, ''Farmer in the Second World War'' (1947)</ref> Civilians were encouraged to create \"[[victory garden]]s\", farms that were often started in backyards and lots. Children were encouraged to help with these farms, too.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kallen|first=Stuart A.|title=The war at home|year=2000|publisher=Lucent Books|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56006-531-9|pages=43\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bracero Program]], a bi-national labor agreement between Mexico and the U.S., started in 1942. Some 290,000 braceros (\"strong arms,\" in Spanish) were recruited and contracted to work in the agriculture fields. Half went to Texas, and 20% to the Pacific Northwest.<ref>Otey M. Scruggs, 'Texas and the Bracero Program, 1942-1947,' ''Pacific Historical Review'' (1963) 32#3 pp. 251-264 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4492180 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Erasmo Gamboa, ''Mexican Labor & World War II: Braceros in the Pacific Northwest, 1942-1947'' (2000)</ref>\n\nBetween 1942 and 1946 some 425,000 Italian and [[German prisoners of war in the United States|German prisoners of war]] were used as farm laborers, loggers, and cannery workers. In Michigan, for example, the POWs accounted for more than one-third of the state's agricultural production and food processing in 1944.<ref>Duane Ernest Miller, 'Barbed-Wire Farm Laborers: Michigan'S Prisoners of War Experience during World War II,' ''Michigan History,'' Sept 1989, Vol. 73 Issue 5, pp. 12-17</ref>\n\n===Children===\n\nTo help with the need for a larger source of food, the nation looked to school-aged children to help on farms. Schools often had a [[victory garden]] in vacant parking lots and on roofs. Children would help on these farms to help with the war effort.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kallen|first=Stuart A.|title=The war at home|year=2000|publisher=Lucent Books|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1560065319}}</ref> The slogan, \"Grow your own, can your own\", also influenced children to help at home.<ref>{{cite web|title=World War II: Civic responsibility|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/civic_responsibility/smithsonian_siyc_fall07.pdf|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Teenagers===\n\nWith the war's ever-increasing need for able-bodied men consuming America's labor force in the early 1940s, the industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements.<ref>Hinshaw (1943)</ref> Consequently, many states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to work. The lures of patriotism, adulthood, and money led many youths to drop out of school and take a defense job. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, and the number of students in public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6 million in 1944, like a million students\u2014and many teachers\u2014took jobs.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) table H-424</ref>\n\n===Labor unions===\n[[File:AlfredPalmerwelder1.jpg|thumb|200px|Welder making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Co., [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. June 1942.]]\nThe war mobilization changed the relationship of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) with both employers and the national government.<ref>Lichtenstein (2003)</ref> Both the CIO and the larger [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) grew rapidly in the war years.<ref>Philip Taft, ''The A.F. of L. from the Death of Gompers to the Merger'' (1959) pp. 204-33</ref>\n\nNearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However, the United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940, left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts but also the innumerable small strikes called by [[shop steward]]s and local union leadership to protest particular grievances. In return for labor's no-strike pledge, the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts. Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940-1945'' (2004) p. 410</ref>\n\nEven though the complaints from union members about the no-strike pledge became louder and more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The Mine Workers, by contrast, who did not belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine leader [[John L. Lewis]] a much-hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions.<ref>Melvyn Dubofsky and Warren Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography'' (1977) pp. 415-44</ref>\n\nAll the major unions grew stronger during the war. The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of [[union security]], through arbitration and negotiation. Employers gave workers new untaxed benefits (such as vacation time, pensions, and health insurance), which increased real incomes even when wage rates were frozen.<ref>William H. Holley et al.

Some, such as the Steelworkers, had always been centralized organizations in which authority for major decisions resided at the top. The UAW, by contrast, had always been a more grassroots organization, but it also started to try to rein in its maverick local leadership during these years.<ref>Martin Glaberman, ''Wartime Strikes: The Struggle Against the No Strike Pledge in the UAW During World War II'' (1980)</ref> The CIO also had to confront deep racial divides in its membership, particularly in the UAW plants in [[Detroit]] where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs, but also in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in further left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU, and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes, to educate their membership, and to support the Roosevelt Administration's tentative efforts to remedy racial discrimination in war industries through the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]]. Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL.<ref>Andrew Kersten, ''Race, Jobs, and the War: The FEPC in the Midwest, 1941-46'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe CIO unions were progressive in dealing with [[gender discrimination]] in the wartime industry, which now employed many more women workers in nontraditional jobs. Unions that had represented large numbers of women workers before the war, such as the UE (electrical workers) and the [[International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association|Food and Tobacco Workers]], had fairly good records of fighting discrimination against women. Most union leaders saw women as temporary wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces. The wages of these women needed to be kept high so that the veterans would get high wages.<ref>Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' ch 5</ref>\n\n==The South in wartime==\nThe war marked a time of dramatic change in the poor, heavily rural South as new industries and military bases were developed by the Federal government, providing badly needed capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region's many bases and new industries.  During and after the war millions of hard-scrabble farmers, both white and black, left agriculture for urban jobs.<ref>Morton Sosna, and James C. Cobb, ''Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South'' (UP of Mississippi, 1997).</ref><ref>Ralph C.

Hoover and B.U. Ratchford, ''Economic Resources and Policies of the South'' (1951).</ref>\n\nUnited States began mobilizing for war in a major way in the spring of 1940. The warm sunny weather of the South proved ideal for building 60 percent of the Army's new training camps and nearly half the new airfields, In all 40 percent of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example, sleepy [[Starke, Florida]], a town of 1500 people in 1940, became the base of [[Camp Blanding]]. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers.  Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built In Virginia, Charleston, and along the Gulf Coast. Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia. The most secret and expensive operation was at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], were unlimited amounts of locally generated electricity were used to prepare uranium for the atom bomb.<ref>Russell B. Olwell, ''At Work in the Atomic City: A Labor and Social History of Oak Ridge, Tennessee'' (2004.</ref> The number of production workers doubled during the war. Most training centers, factories and shipyards were closed in 1945 and the families that left hardscrabble farms often remained to find jobs in the urban South. The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as [[George B. Tindall]] notes, the transformation was, \"The demonstration of industrial potential, new habits of mind, and a recognition that industrialization demanded community services.\"<ref>Dewey W. Grantham, ''The South in modern America'' 1994) pp 172-183.</ref><ref>Tindall, ''The Emergence of the New South'' pp.694-701, quoting p. 701.</ref>\n\n==Civilian support for war effort==\n{{See also|United States civil defense#World War II|American propaganda during World War II}}\n[[File: Synagogue D-Day3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[synagogue]] in New York City remained open 24 hours on D-Day (June 6, 1944) for special services and prayer.]]\n\nEarly in the war, it became apparent that German U-boats were using the backlighting of coastal cities in the Eastern Seaboard and the South to destroy ships exiting harbors. It became the first duty of civilians recruited for the local civilian defense to ensure that [[Blackout (wartime)|lights were either off or thick curtains drawn over all windows at night]].\n\n[[State Guard#Origins|State Guards]] were reformed for internal security duties to replace the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] who were federalized and sent overseas. The [[Civil Air Patrol]] was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary|Coast Guard Auxiliary]], used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was to remind people that there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could hope to reach.<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell</ref>\n\nThe [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) was founded in 1941 in response to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to uniformed military personnel. The USO brought together six civilian agencies: the [[Salvation Army]], [[YMCA]], [[YWCA USA|Young Women's Christian Association]], [[National Catholic Community Service]], [[Travelers Aid International|National Travelers Aid Association]], and the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]].<ref name=\"Meghan K.

Other women previously employed only in the home, or in traditionally female work, took jobs in factories that directly supported the war effort or filled jobs vacated by men who had entered military service.

Women entered the workforce because men were [[Conscription|drafted]] into the armed forces.]]\n\nIn 1940, Congress passed the first peace-time [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] legislation. It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It involved questions as to who should control the draft, the size of the army, and the need for deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them. There was very little draft resistance.<ref>Flynn (1993)</ref>\n\nThe nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. The industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940\u201343 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps to increase production. Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be recalled to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed essential. There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries. Working men who had been classified [[4F (military conscription)|4F]] or otherwise ineligible for the draft took second jobs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn the figure below an overview of the development of the United States labor force, the armed forces and unemployment during the war years.<ref>the US Bureau of the Census; Bicentennial edition, Part 2, Chapter D, Labor, Series D 1-10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Total labor force (*1000)\n!Armed forces (*1000)\n!Unemployed (*1000)\n!Unemployment rate (%)\n|-\n|1939 ||55,588 ||370 ||9,480|| 17.2\n|-\n|1940 ||56,180 ||540 ||8,120|| 14.6\n|-\n|1941 ||57,530 ||1,620 ||5,560|| 9.9\n|-\n|1942 ||60,380 ||3,970 ||2,660|| 4.7\n|-\n|1943 ||64,560 ||9,020 ||1,070|| 1.9\n|-\n|1944 ||66,040 ||11,410 ||670|| 1.2\n|-\n|1945 ||65,290 ||11,430 ||1,040|| 1.9\n|-\n|1946 ||60,970 ||3,450 ||2,270|| 3.9\n|-\n|}\n\nOne contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers, which was avoided as much as possible. The drafting of 18-year-olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion. Racial minorities were drafted at the same rate as Whites and were paid the same, but blacks were kept in all-black units. The experience of World War I regarding men needed by industry was particularly unsatisfactory\u2014too many skilled mechanics and engineers became privates (there is a possibly apocryphal story of a ''banker'' assigned as a ''baker'' due to a clerical error, noted by historian Lee Kennett in his book \"G.I.\") Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments (many volunteered anyway, but those who stayed at home lost postwar veteran's benefits.)\n\nLater in the war, in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France in 1944, many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the 1930s, pacifism was a very strong force in most of the Protestant churches. Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan.  After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the \"[[Double V]]\" campaign of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by [[John Foster Dulles]], a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations.<ref>John  P.

The pacifist churches such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service, though many young members, such as [[Richard Nixon]] voluntarily joined the military. Unlike in 1917-1918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for [[conscientious objectors]]. The [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]] had a strong pacifist element reaching a high point in the late 1930s. This small Fundamentalist Protestant denomination regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked.<ref>Mitchell K. Hall, 'A Withdrawal from Peace: The Historical Response to War of the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana),' ''Journal of Church and State'' (1985) 27#2 pp. 301-314</ref> Likewise, the Quakers generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors.<ref>Thomas D. Hamm, et al., 'The Decline of Quaker Pacifism in the Twentieth Century: Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends as a Case Study,' ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (2000) 96#1 pp. 45-71 [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/imh/VAA4025-096-1-a03 online]</ref> The [[Mennonite]]s and Brethren continued their pacifism, but the federal government was much less hostile than in the previous war. These churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. [[Goshen College]] set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although young women pacifists were not eligible for the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941-1947'' (1997) pp. 98-111</ref> The [[Jehovah Witness]] denomination, however, refused to participate in any forms of service, and thousands of its young men refused to register and went to prison.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

Some enemy aliens were held without trial during the entire war.

Large numbers of African Americans left the cotton fields and headed for the cities. Housing was increasingly difficult to find in industrial centers, as there was no new non-military construction. Commuting by car was limited by gasoline rationing. People carpooled or took public transportation, which was severely overcrowded. Trains were heavily booked, with uniformed military personnel taking priority, so people limited vacation and long-distance travel.\n\n===Racial tensions===\nThe large-scale movement of black Americans from the rural South to urban and defense centers in the North and the West (and some in the South) during the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] led to local confrontations over jobs and housing shortages. The cities were relatively peaceful; much-feared large-scale race riots did not happen, but there was nevertheless violence on both sides, as in the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|1943 race riot in Detroit]] and the anti-Mexican [[Zoot Suit Riots]] in Los Angeles in 1943.<ref>Walter C.

Meanwhile, the public sphere\u2014the male domain\u2014was redefined as the international stage of military action.<ref>Alecea Standlee, \"Shifting Spheres: Gender, Labor and the Construction of National Identity in U.S. Propaganda during the Second World War,\" ''Minerva Journal of Women & War'' Spring 2010, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 43-62</ref>\n\n===Employment===\nWartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor for women, as young able-bodied men were sent overseas and wartime manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\">{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan |date=1982 |title=Home Front and Beyond: American Women in the 1940s |url=https://archive.org/details/homefrontbeyonda00hartrich|url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=Twayne Publishers |page= |isbn=}}</ref> This was catalyzed by the \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]\" phenomenon.\n\nThe composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed considerably throughout the war. One in every ten married women entered the labor force during the war, and they represented more than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the nation's history, there were more married women than single women in the female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women were employed at some time during that year at the height of wartime production.<ref name=\" Hartmann 1982\"/> In the same year the unemployment rate hit an all-time historical low of 1.2%.<ref>Tassava, Christopher. [http://eh.net/?s=tassava \"The American Economy during World War II\"]. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. February 10, 2008. URL http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/</ref>\n\nAccording to Hartmann (1982), the women who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time suggests that financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice as likely to seek jobs.<ref name=\"Hartmann 1982\"/>\n\nFundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as \"men's work;\" however, the work women did was typically catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity.<ref name=milkman>{{cite book |last=Milkman |first=Ruth |author-link1=Ruth Milkman |date=1987 |title=Gender at Work: The Dynamics of Job Segregation by Sex During World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/genderatworkdyna0000milk |url-access=registration |location=Boston |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page= |isbn=978-0252013577}}</ref> For example, in a [[Sperry Gyroscope Company|Sperry Corporation]] recruitment pamphlet the company stated, \"Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press.\" A [[Ford Motor Company]] at [[Willow Run]] bomber plant publication proclaimed, \"The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters.\" One manager was even stated saying, \"Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles, and darning needles all their lives?\"<ref name=milkman /> In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.\n\nFollowing the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]] (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant) worker in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]] confessed, \"I will gladly get back into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all my life. It was just to help out during the war.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kenney |first=Dave |date=2005 |title=Minnesota at Work |url= |location=St. Paul |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Other women were laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not lose their seniority due to the war.\n\nThere are a few examples of reluctance of women to take on wartime jobs. For example, due to labour shortages the American government had to actively promote the war to civilians and the [[War Manpower Commission]] used propaganda to sell the war to American women. There was a change in attitudes regarding women in employment in wartime America, and the government started to promote women in work as part of nature, and those that resisted or were reluctant to find work were slackers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mobalizing Women for War: German and American Propaganda, 1939-1945|last=Rupp|first=Leila J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=91\u201397}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not return. This left women to take up the sole responsibility of the household and provide economically for the family.\n\n===Nursing===\n\nNursing became a highly prestigious occupation for young women. A majority of female civilian nurses volunteered for the [[Nurse Corps (United States Army)|Army Nurse Corps]] or the [[the United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy Nurse Corps]].

Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.\n\nThe [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying a warplane had always been a male role.

The birth rate started shooting up in 1941, paused in 1944\u201345 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the \"[[Baby Boom]]\".\n\nIn a [[New Deal]]-like move, the federal government set up the \"EMIC\" program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant.\n\nHousing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little housing had been built in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] years, so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1949 when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand. (After 1944 much of the new housing was supported by the [[G.I. Bill]].)\n\nFederal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range terms, divorce rates changed little.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n===Housewives===\n[[File: Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum July 2015 44 (World War II American home front diorama).jpg|thumb|A World War II American home front diorama, depicting a woman and her daughter, at the [[Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum]]]]\n\nJuggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.\n\nStress came when sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fianc\u00e9s were drafted and sent to faraway training camps, preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training camps.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n==Racial politics of the war==\n\n===Immigration policies during and after World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]] the trend in immigration policies was both more and less restrictive.

This Act was the first law in the United States that excluded a specific group- the Chinese from migrating to the United States.<ref name=\":0\" /> But during World War II, with the Chinese as allies, the United States passed the [[Magnuson Act]], also known as the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. There was also the [[Nationality Act of 1940]], which clarified how to become and remain a citizen.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, it allowed immigrants who were not citizens, like the Filipinos or those in the outside territories to gain citizenship by enlisting in the army.  In contrast, the Japanese and Japanese-Americans were subject to internment in the U.S. There was also legislation like the [[Smith Act]], also known as the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which required indicted communists, anarchists, and fascists. Another program was the [[Bracero program|Bracero Program]], which allowed over two decades, nearly 5 million Mexican workers to come and work in the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter World War II, there was also the [[Truman Directive of 1945]], which did not allow more people to migrate but did use the immigration quotas to let in more displaced people after the war.<ref>{{Cite web|title = United States Policy Toward Jewish Refugees, 1941\u20131952|url = http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007094|website = www.ushmm.org|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> There was also the War Brides Act of 1945, which allowed spouses of US soldiers to get an expedited path towards citizenship.

The question became how to evacuate the estimated 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry living in [[California]]. Roosevelt looked at the secret evidence available to him:<ref>Keith Robar, ''Intelligence, Internment & Relocation: Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066: How Top Secret \"MAGIC\" Intelligence-Led to Evacuation'' (2000)</ref> the Japanese in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] had collaborated with the Japanese invasion troops; most of the adult Japanese in California had been strong supporters of Japan in the war against China. There was evidence of [[espionage]] compiled by [[Cryptanalysis|code-breakers]] that decrypted messages to Japan from agents in North America and [[Hawaii]] before and after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. These [[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]] cables were kept a secret from all but those with the highest clearance, such as Roosevelt. On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 9066]] which set up designated military areas \"from which any or all persons may be excluded.\" The most controversial part of the order included American born children and youth who had dual U.S. and Japanese citizenship. Germans and Italians were not interned, as shown from the ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' case.\n\nIn February 1943, when activating the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]]\u2014a unit composed mostly of American-born American citizens of Japanese descent living in Hawaii\u2014Roosevelt said, \"No loyal citizen of the United States should be denied the democratic right to exercise the responsibilities of his citizenship, regardless of his ancestry. The principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart; Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry.\" In 1944, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the legality of the executive order in the ''Korematsu v. United States'' case. The executive order remained in force until December when Roosevelt released the Japanese internees, except for those who announced their intention to return to Japan.\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]] was an official enemy, and citizens of Italy were also forced away from \"strategic\" coastal areas in [[California]]. Altogether, 58,000 Italians were forced to relocate. They relocated on their own and were not put in camps. Known spokesmen for [[Benito Mussolini]] were arrested and held in prison. The restrictions were dropped in October 1942, and Italy switched sides in 1943 and became an American ally. In the east, however, the large Italian populations of the northeast, especially in munitions-producing centers such as [[Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven]], faced no restrictions and contributed just as much to the war effort as other Americans.\n\n===FEPC===\nThe [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]] (FEPC) was a federal executive order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate based on race or religion. It assisted African Americans in obtaining defense industry jobs during the second wave of the Great Migration of southern blacks to Northern and Western war production and urban centers. Under pressure from [[A. Philip Randolph|A. Philip Randolph's]] growing March on Washington Movement, on June 25, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) by signing [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 8802. It said, \"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin\". In 1943 Roosevelt greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order, #9346. It required that all government contracts have a non-discrimination clause.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The FEPC and the legacy of the labor-based Civil Rights Movement of the 1940s|journal = Labor History|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 0023-656X|pages = 71\u201392|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00236560701740093|first = Kevin M.|last = Schultz}}</ref> FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and women on the job front. During the war, the federal government operated airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other facilities that employed millions. FEPC rules applied and guaranteed equality of employment rights. These facilities shut down when the war ended. In the private sector, the FEPC was generally successful in enforcing non-discrimination in the North and West but did not attempt to challenge segregation in the South, and in the border region, its intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers.<ref>Garfinkel</ref>\n\n===African Americans and the Double V campaign===\n{{Main|Double V campaign}}\n[[File:\"V\" home campaign, Washington, DC, 10-1942 - NARA - 533827.tif|thumb|200px|Participants in the Double V campaign, 1942.

During the second phase of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], five million African-Americans relocated from rural and poor Southern farms to urban and munitions centers in Northern and Western states in search of racial, economic, social, and political opportunities. Racial tensions remained high in these cities, particularly in overcrowding in housing as well as competition for jobs. As a result, cities such as [[1943 Detroit race riot|Detroit]], [[Harlem Riot of 1943|New York]], and [[Zoot Suit Riots|Los Angeles]] experienced [[race riot]]s in 1943, leading to dozens of deaths.<ref>Robert Shogan and Tom Craig, ''The Detroit Race Riot: A Study in Violence'' (1976)</ref> Black newspapers created the Double V campaign to build black morale and head off radical action.<ref>Lee Finkle, 'The Conservative Aims of Militant Rhetoric: Black Protest during World War II',: ''Journal of American History,'' Dec 1973, Vol. 60 Issue 3, pp. 692-713 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1917685 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMost black women had been farm laborers or domestics before the war.<ref>Maureen Honey ''Bitter Fruit: African American Women in World War II'' (1999).</ref> Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these Black women fought a \"[[Double V campaign]]\" \u2014fighting against the Axis abroad and restrictive hiring practices at home.

For example, the comic book Captain America No. 1 features the titular superhero punching Hitler.  Similar anti-German sentiments existed in cartoons as well.  The Popeye cartoon, ''[[Seein' Red, White 'N' Blue|Seein' Red, White, 'N' Blue]]'' (aired on February 19, 1943), ends with Uncle Sam punching a sickly-looking Hitler.  In the Donald Duck cartoon ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'', Donald Duck is portrayed as a Nazi living in Germany, where the Nazi war effort is heavily satirized and caricatured.<ref>{{Citation|last=Solarer111|title=Donald Duck - Der Fuehrer's face {{!}} eng sub|date=2011-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn20oXFrxxg|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAmerican media portrayed the Japanese negatively as well. While attacks on Germans were generally focused on high-level Nazi officials such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, and G\u00f6ring, the Japanese were targeted more broadly.  Portrayals of the Japanese ranged from showing them being vicious and feral, as on the cover of Marvel Comic's Mystery Comics no. 32, to mocking their physical appearance and speech patterns.  In the Loony Tune's cartoon ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'' (aired May 13, 1943), the Japanese people are all shown to be dim-witted, obsessed with being polite, cowardly, and physically short with buckteeth, big lips, squinty eyes, and glasses.  The entire cartoon is also narrated in broken English, with the letter \"R\" often replacing \"L\" in pronunciation of words, a common stereotype.<ref>{{Citation|last=8thManDVD.com\u2122 Cartoon Channel|title=LOONEY TUNES (Looney Toons): Tokio Jokio (WW2 Racist) (1943) (Remastered) (HD 1080p)|date=2015-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlUld1yXKRo|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>  Japanese slurs were commonly used, such as \"Jap,\" \"monkey face,\" and \"slanty eyes.\"  <ref>{{Citation|last=sshproover|title=Popeye The Sailor 113 - Scrap the Japs [BANNED]|date=2011-01-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCFZ6nh9djY|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Monolaf|title=My Personal Favourite Moments involving Bugs Bunny During WWII|date=2016-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTvvPbBruiA|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>  These stereotypes are also seen in [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Geisel]]'s comics created during the Second World War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/10/dr-seusss-wartime-propaganda-cartoons/|title=Dr. Seuss's World War II Political Propaganda Cartoons|last=Popova|first=Maria|date=2012-08-10|website=Brain Pickings|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Wartime politics==\nRoosevelt easily won the bitterly contested [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], but the Conservative coalition maintained a tight grip on Congress regarding taxes and domestic issues. [[Wendell Willkie]], the defeated GOP candidate in 1940, became a roving ambassador for Roosevelt. After Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] became enmeshed in a series of squabbles with other high officials, Roosevelt stripped him of his administrative responsibilities and dropped him from the 1944 ticket. Roosevelt in cooperation with big-city party leaders replaced Wallace with Missouri Senator [[Harry S. Truman]]. Truman was best known for investigating waste, fraud, and inefficiency in wartime programs.  In very light turnout in 1942, the Republicans made major gains. In the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]], Roosevelt defeated [[Tom Dewey]] in a race that attracted little attention.<ref>David M.

Inexpensive, accessible, and ever-present, the poster was an ideal agent for making war aims the personal mission of every citizen. Government agencies, businesses, and private organizations issued an array of poster images linking the military front with the home front\u2014calling upon every American to boost production at work and home.

Hollywood had military units that made training films \u2013 [[Ronald Reagan]] narrated many of them. Nearly all of Hollywood made hundreds of war movies that, in coordination with the [[Office of War Information]] (OWI), taught Americans what was happening and who the heroes and the villains were. Ninety million people went to the movies every week.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert L. McLaughlin|author2=Sally E.

Even before active American involvement in the war, the popular [[Three Stooges]] comic trio were lampooning the Nazi German leadership, and Nazis in general, with a number of [[short subject]] films, starting with ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' released in January 1940 - the very first Hollywood film of any length to satirize Hitler and the Nazis<ref>[http://www.threestooges.net/filmography/episode/44 ''You Nazty Spy!'' at threestooges.net]</ref> - nearly two years before the United States was drawn into World War II.\n\nCartoons and short subjects were a major sign of the times, as [[Warner Brothers Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney Studios]] gave unprecedented aid to the war effort by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous, and also contributed to remind movie-goers of wartime activities such as rationing and scrap drives, war bond purchases, and the creation of [[victory garden]]s. Warner shorts such as ''[[Daffy - The Commando]]'', ''[[Draftee Daffy]]'', ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'', and ''[[Russian Rhapsody (film)|Russian Rhapsody]]'' are particularly remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy (particularly [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]). Their cartoons of [[Private Snafu]], produced for the military as \"training films\", served to remind many military men of the importance of following proper procedure during wartime, for their safety. [[Hanna-Barbera]] also contributed to the war effort with slyly pro-US short cartoon [[The Yankee Doodle Mouse]] with \"Lt.\" [[Jerry Mouse]] as the hero and [[Tom Cat]] as the \"enemy\".\n\nTo heighten the suspense, Hollywood needed to feature attacks on American soil and obtained inspirations for dramatic stories from the Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines became a \"homefront\" that showed the American way of life threatened by the Japanese enemy. Especially popular were the films ''[[Texas to Bataan]]'' (1942), ''[[Corregidor (1943 film)|Corregidor]]'' (1943), ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943),  ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945), and ''[[Back to Bataan]]'' (1945).<ref>Camilla Fojas, 'Foreign Domestics: The Filipino \"Homefront\" in World War II Hollywood,' ''Comparative American Studies'' (March 2010) 8#1 pp. 3-21.</ref>\n\nThe OWI had to approve every film before they could be exported. To facilitate the process the OWI's Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP) worked with producers, directors, and writers before the shooting started to make sure that the themes reflected patriotic values. While Hollywood had been generally nonpolitical before the war, the liberals who controlled OWI encouraged the expression of New Deal liberalism, bearing in mind the huge domestic audience, as well as an international audience that was equally large.<ref>Clayton R. Koppes and Gregory D. Black, 'What to Show the World: The Office of War Information and Hollywood, 1942-1945,' ''Journal of American History'' (1977) 64#1 pp. 87-105; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1888275 in JSTOR]; they report on p. 90, \"OWI demanded affirmation of New Deal liberalism for America and the world.\"</ref>\n\n===Censorship===\nThe [[Office of Censorship]] published a code of conduct for newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. The office did not use government censors to preapprove all articles and radio programs. It relied on voluntary cooperation to avoid subjects, such as troop movements, weather forecasts, and the travels of the President, that might aid the enemy. Journalists did not have to publish positive propaganda, unlike during World War I.\n\n==Local activism==\n<!--Linked to form [[Union Pacific Railroad#Union Pacific in the 20th Century]]-->\nOne way to enlist everyone in the war effort was scrap collection (called \"recycling\" decades later). Many everyday commodities were vital to the war effort, and drives were organized to recycle such products as rubber, tin, waste kitchen fats (raw material for explosives), newspaper, lumber, steel, and many others. Popular phrases promoted by the government at the time were \"Get into the scrap!\" and \"Get some cash for your trash\" (a nominal sum was paid to the donor for many kinds of scrap items) and [[Thomas \"Fats\" Waller]] even wrote and recorded a song with the latter title. Such commodities as rubber and tin remained highly important as recycled materials until the end of the war, while others, such as steel, were critically needed at first. War propaganda played a prominent role in many of these drives. Nebraska had perhaps the most extensive and well-organized drives; it was mobilized by the ''[[Omaha World Herald]]'' newspaper.<ref>James J.

Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with [[Thai League 2]]. Seasons run from February to October, with each team playing 30 games (playing all 15 other teams both home and away). It is sponsored by [[Toyota]] and therefore officially known as the '''Toyota Thai League'''. In the Thai League, most of the games are played during Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThailand has had league-football competition since 1916. Before the inception of the '''Thai League''', the highest level of club football was the semi-professional league [[Kor Royal Cup]] ({{lang-th|\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e01.}}) which was contested in a tournament format from 1916 to 1995.\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nThai League was introduced in 1996 by the [[Football Association of Thailand]] (FAT) under the name [[1996\u201397 Thailand Soccer League|Thailand Soccer League]]. Eighteen clubs who earlier competed for the Kor Royal Cup were registered to play in the first edition of a double round-robin league system.<ref>[http://www.fat.or.th/web/tpl1996.php Thai Premier League 1996 summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200351/http://www.fat.or.th/web/tpl1996.php |date=30 April 2008 }}</ref> [[Thai Farmers Bank F.C.|Thai Farmers Bank]] was crowned as the first champion of the [[1996\u201397 Thailand Soccer League]].\n\nThe Thai League originally had 10 to 12 clubs each season until [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]], when it was expanded to 16 clubs. At the end of each season, the three bottom placed clubs are relegated to the [[Thai Division 1 League]].\n\n=== Leagues integration (2007) ===\n\nMost of Thai League clubs in that time were the organisation of government authorities club that based in [[Greater Bangkok]] and Metropolitan. Meanwhile, the other local clubs had competed in the semi-pro league called the [[Provincial League]]. Thai Premier League faced the issue of low attendance and lack of local loyalties while the Provincial league suffered the financial issue. In [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]], Thai League was integrated with [[Provincial League]] completely. [[Chonburi F.C.|Chonburi]] from the Provincial League was the first champion of the new Thailand Premier League in [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]] season.\n\n===Modern era (2009)===\n\nIn [[2009 Thai Premier League|2009 season]], there were significant changes in the lead to the new era of the '''Thai Premier League'''. [[Asian Football Confederation]] declared the regulations for the associations that have the intention to send the clubs to compete in [[AFC Champions League]] starting from 2011.<ref>[http://www.the-afc.com/uploads/afc/docs/acl2011criteria.pdf ACL Criteria for 2011]</ref> Football Association of Thailand had to establish Thai Premier League co.ltd and forced the clubs in the top league to complete AFC Club License Criteria<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.fat.or.th/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/club_licensing_regulations_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329204527/http://www.fat.or.th/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/club_licensing_regulations_2010.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }} AFC Club License Criterea</ref> otherwise Thai clubs will not eligible to play in the Champions League. Clubs were forced to separate themselves from the parent organisations and registered as the independent football authorities.\n\nThe massive changes occurred in that season. Thailand Premier League renamed to Thai Premier League. Two times league champion [[Krung Thai Bank F.C.|Krung Thai Bank]] failed to complete the new regulations. The organisation decided to sell the club. The club was acquired by [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boon Rawd]] and rebranded to be [[Bangkok Glass F.C.|Bangkok Glass]]. [[Bangkok University]] had expelled their football club section. The club rebrand itself to [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]] since then. The organisation-based clubs had to relocate to find the local supporters to backup the clubs. [[Osotspa F.C.|Osotspa]] changed their home stadium to [[Saraburi Province]], [[TOT F.C.|TOT]] moved to play in [[Kanchanaburi Province|Kanchanaburi]], [[Royal Thai Navy F.C.|Royal Navy]] played in [[Rayong Province]] while [[TTM Customs F.C.|Thailand Tobacco Monopoly]] integrated to [[Samut Sakhon Province]] and rebranded to TTM Samut Sakhon.\n\n[[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] were promoted from [[Thai Division 1 League]] in that season and won Thai Premier League in their first year in the top league.\n\n===Thailand Clasico===\n\nThailand Clasico or The Classic Match of Thailand is the matchup between [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] and [[Chonburi F.C.|Chonburi]]. It is the matchup that presents Thai football in the modern era. The name was given to the encounter of two teams due to the hype and massive atmosphere around the match. The first encounter between them happened in the [[2009 Thai Premier League]] season. On 30 May 2009, Chonburi that was regarded as the best club in Thailand at that moment hosted the new powerhouse who were just promoted from Division 1 Muangthong United. The match was played at [[Nong Prue Stadium]], [[Pattaya]]. Before the match, Chonburi was the leader in the table after 10 matches of the season while Muangthong followed in second with one less point. Chonburi made the lead by 2\u20130 in the first thirty minutes but Muangthong bounced back to win by the 5\u20132 result at the end. The match was full of the exciting and dramatic moments. Then, it was considered as one of the most classic matches in Thai League history. The Muangthong versus Chonburi matchup was dubbed as \"Thailand Clasico\" ever since then.\n\n===The first invincible===\n\nIn [[2012 Thai Premier League|2012 season]], [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] under [[Serbs|Serbian]] head coach [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], had become the first club in the league history that completed the season with an unbeaten record. Muangthong finished at the top of the final standing with 25 wins and 9 draws.\n\n===Buriram dominance===\n\nThe Buriram Dominance refers to the 2013 to 2015 season, which [[Buriram United F.C.|Buriram United]] won Thai Premier League in three consecutive seasons as the first club in the league history. The three titles in that period included two invincible titles which Buriram United completed Thai Premier League campaign unbeaten in [[2013 Thai Premier League|2013]] and [[2015 Thai Premier League|2015 season]].\n\n===Rebranding (2017)===\nIn 2017, [[Football Association of Thailand]] decided to rebrand Thai Premier League into Thai League 1. Since its inception in 1996 the Thai Premier League has relied upon local sponsorship.  Re-branding initiatives seek to foster an international identity for the Thai and elevate the league globally through commitment to world class level management and marketing which incorporates multifaceted promotion through various media in order to draw attention to league competition and cups.<ref>[http://www.adaymagazine.com/articles/draft-16

Thai League. During the course of a season, which lasts from February to October, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then head-to-head, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the head-to-head, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the [[Thai League 2]] and the top three teams from the Thai League 2 are promoted in their place.\n\n==== Qualification for Asian competitions ====\n{{See also|AFC Club Competitions Ranking|Thai clubs in the Asian Club Championship|Thai clubs in the AFC Champions League|Thai clubs in the AFC Cup}}\nIn the past the champions will play in [[AFC Champions League]] playoffs and [[AFC Cup]] for the champions of [[Thai FA Cup]].

At the top of the [[Thai football league system]], it is the country's premier football competition. Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with [[Thai League 2]]. The Thai League is a corporation in which the 16 member clubs act as [[shareholder]]s. Seasons run from February to October, with teams playing 30 games each with a total of 240 games in the season. It is sponsored by [[Toyota]] and therefore officially known as the '''Toyota Thai League'''. In the Thai League, most of the games are played during Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThailand has had league-football competition since 1916. Before the inception of the '''Thai League''', the highest level of club football was the semi-professional league [[Kor Royal Cup]] ({{lang-th|\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e01.}}) which was contested in a tournament format from 1916 to 1995.\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nThai League was introduced in 1996 by the [[Football Association of Thailand]] (FAT) under the name [[1996\u201397 Thailand Soccer League|Thailand Soccer League]]. Eighteen clubs who earlier competed for the Kor Royal Cup were registered to play in the first edition of a double round-robin league system.<ref>[http://www.fat.or.th/web/tpl1996.php Thai Premier League 1996 summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200351/http://www.fat.or.th/web/tpl1996.php |date=30 April 2008 }}</ref> [[Thai Farmers Bank F.C.|Thai Farmers Bank]] was crowned as the first champion of the [[1996\u201397 Thailand Soccer League]].\n\nThe Thai League originally had 10 to 12 clubs each season until [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]], when it was expanded to 16 clubs. At the end of each season, the three bottom placed clubs are relegated to the [[Thai Division 1 League]].\n\n=== Leagues integration (2007) ===\n\nMost of Thai League clubs in that time were the organisation of government authorities club that based in [[Greater Bangkok]] and Metropolitan. Meanwhile, the other local clubs had competed in the semi-pro league called the [[Provincial League]]. Thai Premier League faced the issue of low attendance and lack of local loyalties while the Provincial league suffered the financial issue. In [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]], Thai League was integrated with [[Provincial League]] completely. [[Chonburi F.C.|Chonburi]] from the Provincial League was the first champion of the new Thailand Premier League in [[Thai Premier League 2007|2007]] season.\n\n===Modern era (2009)===\n\nIn [[2009 Thai Premier League|2009 season]], there were significant changes in the lead to the new era of the '''Thai Premier League'''. [[Asian Football Confederation]] declared the regulations for the associations that have the intention to send the clubs to compete in [[AFC Champions League]] starting from 2011.<ref>[http://www.the-afc.com/uploads/afc/docs/acl2011criteria.pdf ACL Criteria for 2011]</ref> Football Association of Thailand had to establish Thai Premier League co.ltd and forced the clubs in the top league to complete AFC Club License Criteria<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.fat.or.th/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/club_licensing_regulations_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329204527/http://www.fat.or.th/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/club_licensing_regulations_2010.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }} AFC Club License Criterea</ref> otherwise Thai clubs will not eligible to play in the Champions League. Clubs were forced to separate themselves from the parent organisations and registered as the independent football authorities.\n\nThe massive changes occurred in that season. Thailand Premier League renamed to Thai Premier League. Two times league champion [[Krung Thai Bank F.C.|Krung Thai Bank]] failed to complete the new regulations. The organisation decided to sell the club. The club was acquired by [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boon Rawd]] and rebranded to be [[Bangkok Glass F.C.|Bangkok Glass]]. [[Bangkok University]] had expelled their football club section. The club rebrand itself to [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]] since then. The organisation-based clubs had to relocate to find the local supporters to backup the clubs. [[Osotspa F.C.|Osotspa]] changed their home stadium to [[Saraburi Province]], [[TOT F.C.|TOT]] moved to play in [[Kanchanaburi Province|Kanchanaburi]], [[Royal Thai Navy F.C.|Royal Navy]] played in [[Rayong Province]] while [[TTM Customs F.C.|Thailand Tobacco Monopoly]] integrated to [[Samut Sakhon Province]] and rebranded to TTM Samut Sakhon.\n\n[[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] were promoted from [[Thai Division 1 League]] in that season and won Thai Premier League in their first year in the top league.\n\n===Thailand Clasico===\n\nThailand Clasico or The Classic Match of Thailand is the matchup between [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] and [[Chonburi F.C.|Chonburi]]. It is the matchup that presents Thai football in the modern era. The name was given to the encounter of two teams due to the hype and massive atmosphere around the match. The first encounter between them happened in the [[2009 Thai Premier League]] season. On 30 May 2009, Chonburi that was regarded as the best club in Thailand at that moment hosted the new powerhouse who were just promoted from Division 1 Muangthong United. The match was played at [[Nong Prue Stadium]], [[Pattaya]]. Before the match, Chonburi was the leader in the table after 10 matches of the season while Muangthong followed in second with one less point. Chonburi made the lead by 2\u20130 in the first thirty minutes but Muangthong bounced back to win by the 5\u20132 result at the end. The match was full of the exciting and dramatic moments. Then, it was considered as one of the most classic matches in Thai League history. The Muangthong versus Chonburi matchup was dubbed as \"Thailand Clasico\" ever since then.\n\n===The first invincible===\n\nIn [[2012 Thai Premier League|2012 season]], [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] under [[Serbs|Serbian]] head coach [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], had become the first club in the league history that completed the season with an unbeaten record. Muangthong finished at the top of the final standing with 25 wins and 9 draws.\n\n===Buriram dominance===\n\nThe Buriram Dominance refers to the 2013 to 2015 season, which [[Buriram United F.C.|Buriram United]] won Thai Premier League in three consecutive seasons as the first club in the league history. The three titles in that period included two invincible titles which Buriram United completed Thai Premier League campaign unbeaten in [[2013 Thai Premier League|2013]] and [[2015 Thai Premier League|2015 season]].\n\n===Rebranding (2017)===\nIn 2017, [[Football Association of Thailand]] decided to rebrand Thai Premier League into Thai League 1. Since its inception in 1996 the Thai Premier League has relied upon local sponsorship.  Re-branding initiatives seek to foster an international identity for the Thai and elevate the league globally through commitment to world class level management and marketing which incorporates multifaceted promotion through various media in order to draw attention to league competition and cups.<ref>[http://www.adaymagazine.com/articles/draft-16

Thai League. During the course of a season, which lasts from February to October, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then head-to-head, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the head-to-head, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the [[Thai League 2]] and the top three teams from the Thai League 2 are promoted in their place.\n\n==== Qualification for Asian competitions ====\n{{See also|AFC Club Competitions Ranking|Thai clubs in the Asian Club Championship|Thai clubs in the AFC Champions League|Thai clubs in the AFC Cup}}\nIn the past the champions will play in [[AFC Champions League]] playoffs and [[AFC Cup]] for the champions of [[Thai FA Cup]].

The original source of the name Mynyddog is from Newydd Fynyddog, a hill near his home. Another submission is the name comes from [[Mynyddog Mwynfawr]], a character in [[Gododdin|an early Welsh poem]]. Use of an adopted Welsh-language pseudonym or [[bardic name]] (''ffug enw'') is common among Welsh poets.\n\n==Birth and upbringing==\nHe was born at D\u00f4l Lydan, [[Llanbrynmair]], [[Montgomeryshire]], in a farmhouse called \"Y Fron\". His father, Daniel Davies, was deacon and [[precentor]] in the Old Chapel, while his mother, Jane, belonged to a bookish family. He was christened by John Roberts (1767\u20131834). When he was two years old, his parents moved to Fron in the same parish. He spent his early days as a farmer and shepherd, and was educated at the Old Chapel school kept by the younger John Roberts (1804\u20131884). His open-air life in rural Wales among rural folk remained a central element of his work.\n\n==Literary career==\nHe was a frequent competitor at the [[Eisteddfodau]], in both the classical and modern metres, and perhaps took his bardic name, Mynyddog, from Newydd Fynyddog, a hill near his home. There is no special merit in his work in the classical metres, but his lyrics became very popular. They were tuneful, unsophisticated poems, which dealt with the joys and tribulations of the common people, the folly of pride, and the absurdity of hypocrisy. He sang these at concerts all over Wales, accompanying himself on a little harmonium. He frequently visited London to listen to the principal singers there, and he was responsible for introducing instrumental music into the Old Chapel. He was in great demand as an adjudicator, a singer, and especially as an Eisteddfod conductor, in both England and Wales. Three volumes of his works were published in his lifetime: ''Caneuon Mynyddog'', 1866; ''Yr Ail Gynnig'', 1870; and ''Y Trydydd Gynnig'', 1877 \u2014 and a fourth volume, ''Pedwerydd Llyfr Mynyddog'', appeared posthumously in 1882. Two volumes of selections from his works were published in ''Cyfres y Fil''. He contributed letters to the ''Herald Cymraeg'', the ''Cronicl'', and ''Dydd'', using the pseudonyms Rhywun, Wmffra Edward, and [[Man in the Moon|Y Dyn a'r Baich Drain]]. These letters dealt with topics of the day and criticised stupid customs. He wrote the original versions of the words of at least two popular Welsh songs: [[Myfanwy]] and [[Sosban Fach]].\n\n==Later life==\nOn 25 September 1871 he married Ann Elizabeth, daughter of Aaron Francis of Rhyl, and built a new house, Bron-y-g\u00e2n, at [[Cemmaes]], Montgomeryshire. In 1876, after conducting the \"Black Chair Eisteddfod\" at Wrexham, he accepted the invitation of his friends to visit America for the sake of his health, but this continued to deteriorate, and he returned to Bron-y-g\u00e2n, where he died on 14 July 1877. He was buried in the Old Chapel graveyard on 19 July.<ref>{{cite book|title=Montgomery-shire Collections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sshAAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA2|year=1877|publisher=Powys-land Club|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''Caneuon Mynyddog'' (1866)\n*''Yr Ail Gynnig'' (1870)\n*''Y Trydydd Cynnig'' (1877)\n*''Pedwerydd Llyfr Mynyddog'' (1882)\n*[[Owen Morgan Edwards]] (ed.), ''Gwaith Mynyddog'' (Llanuwchllyn, 1914)\n\n==Biography==\n*T.

The Monastery and surrounding area, which are part of the Region of Macedonia, were transferred from SR Macedonia to SR Serbia in 1947. The most important assembly decisions are the proclaiming of a [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] nation-state of ethnic [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonians]], proclamation of the [[Macedonian language]] as the official language of the Macedonian state. The citizens of Macedonia, regardless of their [[ethnicity|ethnic affiliation]], were guaranteed all [[civil rights]], as well as the right to their [[first language|mother tongue]] and [[confession of faith]].\n\n[[File:ASNOMmemorialcenterPelince-free.JPG|thumb|left|220px|[[ASNOM Memorial Center]] in [[Pelince]]]]\n\nThe first session was opened with the anthem of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) \"[[Rise up dayspring of the freedom]]\", which became also the anthem of the newly proclaimed republic. However, in the next year it was banned by the authorities as [[bulgarophile]] sentiment. ASNOM, as the supreme institution of government, also meant [[de jure]] commencement of the [[constitutional law]] existence of Macedonia as a [[Federated state|constituent country]] within the framework of the future [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslav federation]]. The Assembly issued a ''Manifesto'' which described the situation in the [[Vardar Banovina]] under the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|old Yugoslavia]] as that of the colony. The manifesto issued by ASNOM's first session also explicitly stated its hope for the \"unification of the whole Macedonian people\", i.e., in the whole of the geographical [[region of Macedonia]].\n\n\nThe presiding committee of ASNOM was dominated by elements that were not known for their pro-Yugoslav sentiments. [[Panko Brashnarov]] (a former member of IMRO) chaired (as the oldest member) the inaugural meeting and [[Metodija Andonov-\u010cento]] was elected president. Both wanted a greater independence for the future republic. They saw joining Yugoslavia as a form of second Serbian dominance over Macedonia, and preferred membership in a [[Balkan Federation]] or else complete independence. \u010cento and partly Brashnarov clashed with [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Josip Broz Tito]]\u2019s envoy to Macedonia. One of the contributors in the Assembly was [[Kiro Gligorov]], later the first [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]].

It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" />\n\nSome favoured and often-used effects by Parker include [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/kevin-parker|title=Kevin Parker Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. \"If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded.

I\u2019ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I\u2019ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed \"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\".<ref name=\"LA Times interview\">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n===Influences===\n[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]\nParker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K.

Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala. Despite their difference in sound, he feels he is always somewhat \"channeling Supertramp\".<ref name=\"TheVine-interview-2014\">{{cite web

The album was released on 14 February 2020.\n\nJosh Terry of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' named Tame Impala his \"Artist of the Decade\" for the 2010s, writing, \"No artist captured how genres cross-pollinated throughout the 2010s better than Tame Impala\". He added: \"In the age of streaming and the big-box festival bubble, Parker's discography seems factory-made for both a crowd of thousands and a chill night alone with a vibe-heavy playlist\" and that \"his music embodies the technology-driven sense of loneliness of this decade better than any of his peers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjwkv8/tame-impala-is-the-artist-of-the-decade|title=Tame Impala Is the Artist of the Decade|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Josh|last=Terry|date=7 November 2019|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20th March, 2020, Parker appeared on The Weeknd's [[After Hours (The Weeknd album)|After Hours]], producing and providing background vocals on a track called \"Repeat After Me\" (Interlude)\n\n==Musical style==\nParker's decision to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself is a result of Parker liking \"the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music\".<ref name=\"Nylon TV Interview\">{{cite web|title=Nylon TV Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|publisher=Nylon TV|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043715/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|archivedate=26 June 2014}}</ref> However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. \"The only [[jam session|jamming]] that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded for the sake of the live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" />\n\nSome favoured and often-used effects by Parker include [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/kevin-parker|title=Kevin Parker Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. \"If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently.\"<ref name=\"Undercover TV interview\">{{cite web|title=Undercover TV interview|url=http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|publisher=Undercover TV|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231011401/http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|archivedate=31 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker's process for making music is \"I\u2019ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I\u2019ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I\u2019ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed \"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\".<ref name=\"LA Times interview\">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n===Influences===\n[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]\nParker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K.

Parker has \"always been in love with the [[wall of sound]] as employed by My Bloody Valentine\" and he tries to capture that \"melancholy dreamy feel\".<ref name=\"Kevin Parker LA Times Interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala's Kevin Parker Discusses His Band's Success, Origins and Impressions of California|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. \"If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy.

It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Sopitas interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala en entrevista para Sopitas.com|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|via=YouTube|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181404/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|archivedate=17 October 2013}}</ref> Tame Impala live drummer Jay Watson has described Parker's music as containing \"[[shoegaze]]y guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Hartzine interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala Hartzine interview|url=http://vimeo.com/18386586|via=Vimeo|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928091551/http://vimeo.com/18386586|archivedate=28 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Electronic dance music|Electronic music]] is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying \"The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala KCRW interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala KCRW interview|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|publisher=KCRW|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721173821/http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|archivedate=21 July 2012}}</ref> A heavy feature on ''[[Innerspeaker]]'' is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a [[synthesizer|synth]]. Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala.

{"title_page": "Existential phenomenology", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2016}}\n'''Existential phenomenology''' encompasses a wide range of thinkers who take up the view that philosophy must begin from experience like phenomenology, but argues for the inability of philosophers to themselves exit existence in order to view the human condition universally. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Being and Time|publisher=Harper|year=2008|isbn=978-0061575594|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nIn contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' (\"being-there\"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.<ref>Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50\u201362.</ref> In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''existenzial''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''existenziell'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with \"penetrating fashion\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Most existentialist phenomenologists were concerned with how we are constituted by our experiences and yet how we are also free in some respect to modify both ourselves and the greater world in which we live. \n\nIn Heidegger's language that we are \"[[Being and Time|thrown into the world]]\" Jean-Paul Sartre's that \"existence precedes essence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm|title=Existentialism is a Humanism|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Both of these point out that who any individual is, is a matter of the social, historical, political, and economic situation into which he or she is born. This frees phenomenology from needing to find a universal ground to all experience, since it will always be partial and influenced by the philosopher's own situation. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] argued that the lesson of Husserl's reduction is that \"[[Phenomenology of Perception|there is no complete reduction]]\" because even phenomenologists cannot exist how they have been shaped by their history, culture, society, and language.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=Phenomenology of Perception|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415834339|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> [[Simone de Beauvoir]] explored how greatly norms of gender shapes the very sense of self that women have, in distinction from men, in her work [[The Second Sex]]. [[Hannah Arendt]] discusses how totalitarian regimes in the 20th century presented entirely new regimes of terror that shaped how people understand political life in her work [[The Human Condition]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Arendt|first=Hannah|title=The Human Condition|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0226586601|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Frantz Fanon]] explored the legacy of racism and colonialism on the psyches' of black men.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|title=Black Skin, White Masks|publisher=Grove Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0802143006|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|title=The Wretched of the Earth|publisher=Grove Press|year=|isbn=978-0802141323|location=|pages=}}</ref>However, they all in different ways also stressed the freedom which humans have to alter their experiences through rebellion, political action, writing, thinking, and being. If we are constituted by the human social world, then it is only humans that created it and can create a new world if they take up this task. \n\n==Development==\nBesides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]],  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].\n\n==Other disciplines==\nExistential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines.

This frees phenomenology from needing to find a universal ground to all experience, since it will always be partial and influenced by the philosopher's own situation. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] argued that the lesson of Husserl's reduction is that \"[[Phenomenology of Perception|there is no complete reduction]]\" because even phenomenologists cannot exist how they have been shaped by their history, culture, society, and language.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=Phenomenology of Perception|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415834339|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> [[Simone de Beauvoir]] explored how greatly norms of gender shapes the very sense of self that women have, in distinction from men, in her work [[The Second Sex]].
