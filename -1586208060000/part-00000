It was a defensive [[military alliance]] that was eventually joined by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] (20 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (23 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1 March 1941) and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] (24 November 1940). [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] provoked a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in Belgrade]] two days later. Germany, Italy and Hungary responded by [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]]. The resulting Italo-German [[client state]], known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]], joined the pact on 15 June 1941.\n\nThe Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the [[United States]]. Its practical effects were limited since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world, and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. Some technical co-operation was carried out, and the [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japanese declaration of war]] propelled the war despite not requiring a similar [[declaration of war]] from all other signatories of the pact.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|[[File:Tripartite Pact 27 September 1940.jpg|thumb|Japanese version of the Tripartite Pact, 27 September 1940]]\n\nThe Governments of Japan, Germany, and Italy consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned.\nIt is, furthermore, the desire of the three Governments to extend cooperation to nations in other spheres of the world that are inclined to direct their efforts along lines similar to their own for the purpose of realizing their ultimate object, world peace.\nAccordingly, the Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy have agreed as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Three-Power Pact Between Germany, Italy, and Japan, Signed at Berlin, September 27, 1940|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp|work=Avalon Law Project|accessdate=23 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811060829/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp|archive-date=11 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nARTICLE 1.

The ''[[Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (DAZ) reported his words as follows:\n<blockquote>\nThe purpose of the Pact is, above all things, to help restore peace to the world as quickly as possible. Therefore any other State which wishes to accede to this bloc (''der diesem Block beitreten will''), with the intention of contributing to the restoration of peaceful conditions, will be sincerely and gratefully made welcome and will participate in the economic and political reorganisation.\n</blockquote>\nThe official ''[[Deutsches Nachrichtenb\u00fcro]]'' (DNB), however, as well as most of the press, reported a slightly different version in which the words \"having good will towards the pact\" (''der diesem Pakt wohlwollend gegen\u00fcbertreten will''<ref>http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00013/pdf/UJ_1984_1985_075-115.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704153802/http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00013/pdf/UJ_1984_1985_075-115.pdf |date=2018-07-04}} footnote on page 90</ref>) instead of \"accede to\" were used. It is likely that other nations were not envisioned to join the treaty and that Ribbentrop misspoke. The official record in the DNB, therefore, corrected his words to remove any reference to \"accession\" by other states but produced an awkward wording in the process.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nThe Italian foreign minister, Ciano, was resolutely opposed to the idea of adding smaller states to the pact as late as 20 November 1940; he argued in his diary that they weakened the pact and were useless bits of diplomacy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\n===Hungary===\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was the fourth state to sign the pact and the first to join it after 27 September 1940. The Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], telegraphed his foreign minister, [[Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky]], immediately after news of the signing and of Ribbentrop's speech had reached him. He urged Cs\u00e1ky to join the pact and even claimed that it was the expectation of Germany and Italy that he would do so. He considered it especially important for Hungary to sign the pact before Romania did. In response, Cs\u00e1ky asked Szt\u00f3jay and the ambassador in Rome, [[Frigyes Villani]], to make enquiries regarding Hungary's accession and its potential obligations under the pact. On 28 September, the German secretary of state for foreign affairs, [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]], informed Hungary that Ribbentrop had meant not a \"formal accession\" but merely \"an attitude in the spirit of the Pact\". The Italian answer was similar. Nonetheless, within a week, the Hungarian government had sent out formal notice of its \"spiritual adherence\" to the pact.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nIn the week after Hungary's \"spiritual adherence\", the [[Balkan]] situation changed. Germany granted a Romanian request to send troops to guard the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oil fields, and Hungary granted a German request to allow its troops to transit Hungary to get to Romania. On 7 October 1940, the first German troops arrived in Ploie\u0219ti. It is probable that Romania's accession to the pact had been delayed until the German troops were in place for fear of the Soviets taking pre-emptive action to secure the oil fields for themselves. In turn, Hungary's accession had been delayed until Romania's had been negotiated. On about 9 October, Weizs\u00e4cker delivered a message from Ribbentrop to Szt\u00f3jay to inform him that Hitler now wanted \"friendly states\" to join the pact. In a telephone conversation with Ciano on 9 or 10 October, Ribbentrop claimed that Hungary had sent a second request to join the pact. Mussolini reluctantly consented. On 12 October, Ribbentrop informed Szt\u00f3jay that both Italy and Japan had consented to Hungary's accession. Since the Hungarian regent, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], had specifically instructed Szt\u00f3jay to ask for Hungary to be the first new state to accede to the pact, Ribbentrop granted the request.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[Kingdom of Romania]] had joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers in World War I]] and had received [[Transylvania]] from [[Austria\u2013Hungary]]. After Germany and Italy [[Second Vienna Award|awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary]] and [[Southern Dobruja]] back to Bulgaria and after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|had taken Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], the [[Fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] party came to power< and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940 because of the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]]'s affidavit read out at the [[IG Farben Trial]] (1947\u20131948), he stated that the agreement on entering the pact had been concluded before his visit to Berlin on 22 November 1940.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=441, n. 3}}\n\n===Slovakia===\nOn 14 March 1939, the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]] was declared in the midst of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|dismemberment of Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler invited Monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]] to be the new nation's leader. Soon after it was formed, Slovakia was involved in a [[Slovak-Hungarian War|war with neighboring Hungary]]. Slovakia had signed a \"Protection Treaty\" with Germany, which, however, refused to intervene. The war resulted in territorial gains by Hungary at Slovakia's expense. Even so, [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovakia supported]] the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939.\n\nShortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Slovakia, following the Hungarian lead, sent messages of \"spiritual adherence\" to Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nOn 24 November 1940, the day after Romania signed the pact, the Slovak prime minister and foreign minister, [[Vojtech Tuka]], went to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and signed Slovakia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. His purpose was to increase Tuka's standing in Slovakia relative to that of his rival, Tiso, although the Germans had no intention of permitting Tiso to be removed.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=255}}\n\n===Bulgaria===\n[[File:Protokol-1.03.1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Official protocol of Bulgaria's accession into the Tripartite Pact]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] had been an ally of Germany and on the losing side in World War I. From the beginning, the Germans pressured Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact. On 17 November 1940, Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and Foreign Minister {{ill|Ivan Popov (diplomat)|lt=Ivan Popov|bg|\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432 (\u0434\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442)}} met with Hitler in Germany. According to [[Hermann Neubacher]], Germany's special envoy to the Balkans, Bulgaria's relation to the Axis powers was completely settled at that meeting. On 23 November, however, the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, [[Peter Draganov]], informed the Germans that while Bulgaria had agreed in principle to join the pact, it wished to delay its signing for the time being.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=33}}\n\nThe meeting with Hitler precipitated a visit to Bulgaria by the Soviet diplomat [[Arkady Sobolev]] on 25 November. He encouraged the Bulgarians to sign a mutual assistance pact that had first been discussed in October 1939. He offered Soviet recognition of Bulgarian claims in Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government, however, was disturbed by the subversive actions of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] in response to the talks, apparently at the Soviets' urging.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=34}}\n\nOn 26 December 1940, the far-right politician [[Alexander Tsankov]] introduced a motion in the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] urging the government to accede to the Tripartite Pact immediately, but it was voted down.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=38}}\n\nBulgaria's hand was finally forced by Germany's desire to intervene in the [[Italo-Greek War]], which would require moving troops through Bulgaria. With no possibility of resisting Germany militarily, Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] signed Bulgaria's accession to the pact in Vienna on 1 March 1941. He announced that it was done partly in gratitude for Germany's assistance to Bulgaria in obtaining the [[Treaty of Craiova]] with Romania and that it would not affect Bulgaria's relations with Turkey or the Soviet Union. Later that day, Ribbentrop promised Filov that after the fall of Greece, Bulgaria would obtain an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coastline between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Maritsa]] Rivers.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}\n\nAccording to Article 17 of the [[Tarnovo Constitution]], treaties had to be ratified by the National Assembly. In the case of the Tripartite Pact, the government sought to have the treaty ratified without debate or discussion. Seventeen opposition deputies submitted an [[interpellation (politics)|interpellation]] and one, Ivan Petrov, asked why the National Assembly had not been consulted in advance and whether the pact involved Bulgaria in war. They were ignored. The pact was ratified by a vote of 140 to 20.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}\n\n===Yugoslavia===\n{{Main|Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact}}\nOn 25 March 1941 in Vienna, [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]], the prime minister of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], signed the Tripartite Pact.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sotirovi\u0107|first=Vladislav B.|date=18 December 2011|title=\u041a\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0452\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0458\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443|publisher=NSPM|url=http://www.nspm.rs/istina-i-pomirenje-na-ex-yu-prostorima/knez-pavle-karadjordjevic-i-pristupanje-jugoslavije-trojnom-paktu.html|language=sr|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925215929/http://www.nspm.rs/istina-i-pomirenje-na-ex-yu-prostorima/knez-pavle-karadjordjevic-i-pristupanje-jugoslavije-trojnom-paktu.html|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On 27 March, the regime was overthrown in [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|a military ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] with British support.

Finland joined Operation Barbarossa on 25 June 1941, which started the [[Continuation War]]. In November, Finland signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anticommunist agreement directed against the Soviet Union, with many other countries allied with Germany. Soon, Germany suggested for Finland to sign the Tripartite Pact, but the Finnish government refused since Finland saw its war as a \"separate war\" from the Second World War and saw its objectives as different from those of Nazi Germany. Finland also wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], particularly the United States. During the Second World War, Germany asked Finland several times to sign the pact but the Finnish government declined all offers. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States were maintained until June 1944 although the US ambassador had already been recalled. The [[United Kingdom]], however, declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 in support of its ally, the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the request of the German command, the Finns established a winter warfare school in [[Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4]]. It began its first two-month course for German officers and [[NCOs]] in December 1941. In the summer of 1942, the German-speaking Finnish instructors taught a course on forest warfare. General [[Waldemar Erfurth]], the German liaison to the Finnish general headquarters, considered the school an outstanding success. It was also attended by some Hungarian officers.{{sfn|DiNardo|1996|p=713}}\n\n===Thailand===\n{{Further|Thailand in World War II}}\n[[File:Thai-German in Berlin 1943.png|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Luang Wichitwathakan]] (centre, standing) and German diplomats, 1943]]\n[[Japanese invasion of Thailand|Japan attacked Thailand]] at 02:00 local time on 8 December 1941. The Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tsubokami, told the Thai foreign minister, [[Direk Jayanama]], that Japan wanted only permission for its troops to pass through Thailand to attack the British in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[British Burma|Burma]]. At 07:00, Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (Phibun) held an emergency cabinet meeting in [[Bangkok]], and soon, a ceasefire was ordered. Phibun then met with Tsubokami, who offered him four options: to conclude a defensive\u2013offensive alliance with Japan, to join the Tripartite Pact, to co-operate in Japanese military operations, or to agree to the joint defence of Thailand. Military co-operation was chosen, and the Tripartite Pact was rejected.{{sfn|Chinvanno|1992|p=13}}\n\nAccording to the postwar memoires of Direk Jayanama, Phibun planned to sign the pact later but was prevented by Direk's opposition.{{sfn|Flood|1970|p=989}}\n\n==Tripartite relations, 1940\u20131943==\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Germany and Italy.jpg|thumb|upright|China's declaration of war (9 December 1941) was made on the grounds that the Tripartite Pact banded the allies together \"into a block of aggressor states working closely together to carry out their common program of world conquest and domination\".<ref>[http://www.jvl.leverage.it/china-s-declaration-of-war-against-japan-germany-and-italy-december-1941 China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423154032/http://www.jvl.leverage.it/china-s-declaration-of-war-against-japan-germany-and-italy-december-1941 |date=2017-04-23}} at the Jewish Virtual Library.</ref>]]\nThe \"joint technical commissions\" required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940. They were to consist of a general commission in each capital, consisting of the host's foreign minister and the other two partners' ambassadors. Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions. On 15 December 1941, the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital, Berlin, took place, labelled a \"Tripartite Pact Conference\". It was decided there to form a \"Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers\", but nothing happened for two months. Only the Italians, whom the Japanese mistrusted, pushed for greater collaboration.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nOn 18 January 1942, the German and Italian governments signed two secret operational agreements: one with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and another with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The agreements divided the world along longitude 70\u00b0 east into two major operational zones, but it had almost no military significance. Chiefly, it committed the powers to co-operation in matters of commerce, intelligence and communication.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nOn 24 February 1942, the Permanent Council met under the chairmanship of Ribbentrop, who announced that \"the propaganda effect is one of the main reasons for our meetings\". The representatives set up a propaganda commission and then adjourned indefinitely. The military commission in Berlin met only two or three times by 1943, and there were no trilateral naval talks at all. Germany and Japan conducted separate naval discussions, and Italy consulted the Japanese independently for its planned [[siege of Malta (World War II)|assault on Malta]] in 1942.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nThe economic relationship between the Tripartite powers was fraught with difficulty. Japan would not grant economic concessions to Germany in 1941 for fear of them ruining [[events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor|its negotiations with the United States]]. In January 1942, negotiations on economic co-operation began, but an agreement was not signed until 20 January 1943 in Berlin. Italy was invited to sign a similar agreement in Rome at the same time for propaganda purposes, but none of the supplementary Berlin protocols applied to Italo-Japanese relations.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\n==\"No separate peace\" agreement==\nJapan first pressed Germany to join the war with the United States on 2 December 1941, only two days after notifying Berlin of its intention to go to war. Receiving no response, Japan approached Italy. At 04:00 on the morning of 5 December, Ribbentrop gave the Japanese ambassador a proposal, which had been approved by Italy, to join the war and to prosecute it jointly. On 11 December 1941, the same day as the [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|German declaration of war against the United States]] and the [[Italian declaration of war on the United States|Italian declaration]], the three powers signed an agreement, already hammered out on 8 December, barring any separate peace with the United States or Britain.

It was a defensive [[military alliance]] that was eventually joined by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] (20 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (23 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1 March 1941) and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] (24 November 1940). [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] provoked a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in Belgrade]] two days later. Germany, Italy and Hungary responded by [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]]. The resulting Italo-German [[client state]], known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]], joined the pact on 15 June 1941.\n\nThe Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the [[United States]]. Its practical effects were limited since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world, and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. Some technical co-operation was carried out, and the [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japanese declaration of war]] propelled the war despite not requiring a similar [[declaration of war]] from all other signatories of the pact.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|[[File:Tripartite Pact 27 September 1940.jpg|thumb|Japanese version of the Tripartite Pact, 27 September 1940]]\n\nThe Governments of Japan, Germany, and Italy consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned.\nIt is, furthermore, the desire of the three Governments to extend cooperation to nations in other spheres of the world that are inclined to direct their efforts along lines similar to their own for the purpose of realizing their ultimate object, world peace.\nAccordingly, the Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy have agreed as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Three-Power Pact Between Germany, Italy, and Japan, Signed at Berlin, September 27, 1940|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp|work=Avalon Law Project|accessdate=23 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811060829/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp|archive-date=11 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nARTICLE 1.

In November 1939, Germany and Japan signed the \"Agreement for Cultural Cooperation between Japan and Germany\", which restored the \"reluctant alliance\" between them.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol55/iss4/22 |title=Reluctant Allies: German\u2013Japanese Naval Relations in World War II (book review) |first=Holger H. |last=Herwig |journal=Naval War College Review |format=PDF |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=2002 |access-date=2018-09-25 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116063756/https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol55/iss4/22/ |archive-date=2018-11-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Later signatories==\nIn a ceremonial speech following the signing of the pact on 27 September, Ribbentrop may have suggested that the signatories were open to accepting new signatories in the future. The ''[[Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (DAZ) reported his words as follows:\n<blockquote>\nThe purpose of the Pact is, above all things, to help restore peace to the world as quickly as possible. Therefore any other State which wishes to accede to this bloc (''der diesem Block beitreten will''), with the intention of contributing to the restoration of peaceful conditions, will be sincerely and gratefully made welcome and will participate in the economic and political reorganisation.\n</blockquote>\nThe official ''[[Deutsches Nachrichtenb\u00fcro]]'' (DNB), however, as well as most of the press, reported a slightly different version in which the words \"having good will towards the pact\" (''der diesem Pakt wohlwollend gegen\u00fcbertreten will''<ref>http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00013/pdf/UJ_1984_1985_075-115.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704153802/http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00013/pdf/UJ_1984_1985_075-115.pdf |date=2018-07-04}} footnote on page 90</ref>) instead of \"accede to\" were used. It is likely that other nations were not envisioned to join the treaty and that Ribbentrop misspoke. The official record in the DNB, therefore, corrected his words to remove any reference to \"accession\" by other states but produced an awkward wording in the process.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nThe Italian foreign minister, Ciano, was resolutely opposed to the idea of adding smaller states to the pact as late as 20 November 1940; he argued in his diary that they weakened the pact and were useless bits of diplomacy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\n===Hungary===\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was the fourth state to sign the pact and the first to join it after 27 September 1940. The Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, [[D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay]], telegraphed his foreign minister, [[Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky]], immediately after news of the signing and of Ribbentrop's speech had reached him. He urged Cs\u00e1ky to join the pact and even claimed that it was the expectation of Germany and Italy that he would do so. He considered it especially important for Hungary to sign the pact before Romania did. In response, Cs\u00e1ky asked Szt\u00f3jay and the ambassador in Rome, [[Frigyes Villani]], to make enquiries regarding Hungary's accession and its potential obligations under the pact. On 28 September, the German secretary of state for foreign affairs, [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]], informed Hungary that Ribbentrop had meant not a \"formal accession\" but merely \"an attitude in the spirit of the Pact\". The Italian answer was similar. Nonetheless, within a week, the Hungarian government had sent out formal notice of its \"spiritual adherence\" to the pact.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nIn the week after Hungary's \"spiritual adherence\", the [[Balkan]] situation changed. Germany granted a Romanian request to send troops to guard the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oil fields, and Hungary granted a German request to allow its troops to transit Hungary to get to Romania. On 7 October 1940, the first German troops arrived in Ploie\u0219ti. It is probable that Romania's accession to the pact had been delayed until the German troops were in place for fear of the Soviets taking pre-emptive action to secure the oil fields for themselves. In turn, Hungary's accession had been delayed until Romania's had been negotiated. On about 9 October, Weizs\u00e4cker delivered a message from Ribbentrop to Szt\u00f3jay to inform him that Hitler now wanted \"friendly states\" to join the pact. In a telephone conversation with Ciano on 9 or 10 October, Ribbentrop claimed that Hungary had sent a second request to join the pact. Mussolini reluctantly consented. On 12 October, Ribbentrop informed Szt\u00f3jay that both Italy and Japan had consented to Hungary's accession. Since the Hungarian regent, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], had specifically instructed Szt\u00f3jay to ask for Hungary to be the first new state to accede to the pact, Ribbentrop granted the request.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[Kingdom of Romania]] had joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers in World War I]] and had received [[Transylvania]] from [[Austria\u2013Hungary]]. After Germany and Italy [[Second Vienna Award|awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary]] and [[Southern Dobruja]] back to Bulgaria and after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|had taken Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], the [[Fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] party came to power< and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940 because of the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]]'s affidavit read out at the [[IG Farben Trial]] (1947\u20131948), he stated that the agreement on entering the pact had been concluded before his visit to Berlin on 22 November 1940.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=441, n. 3}}\n\n===Slovakia===\nOn 14 March 1939, the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]] was declared in the midst of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|dismemberment of Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler invited Monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]] to be the new nation's leader. Soon after it was formed, Slovakia was involved in a [[Slovak-Hungarian War|war with neighboring Hungary]]. Slovakia had signed a \"Protection Treaty\" with Germany, which, however, refused to intervene. The war resulted in territorial gains by Hungary at Slovakia's expense. Even so, [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovakia supported]] the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939.\n\nShortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Slovakia, following the Hungarian lead, sent messages of \"spiritual adherence\" to Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439\u201342}}\n\nOn 24 November 1940, the day after Romania signed the pact, the Slovak prime minister and foreign minister, [[Vojtech Tuka]], went to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and signed Slovakia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. His purpose was to increase Tuka's standing in Slovakia relative to that of his rival, Tiso, although the Germans had no intention of permitting Tiso to be removed.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=255}}\n\n===Bulgaria===\n[[File:Protokol-1.03.1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Official protocol of Bulgaria's accession into the Tripartite Pact]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] had been an ally of Germany and on the losing side in World War I. From the beginning, the Germans pressured Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact. On 17 November 1940, Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and Foreign Minister {{ill|Ivan Popov (diplomat)|lt=Ivan Popov|bg|\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432 (\u0434\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442)}} met with Hitler in Germany. According to [[Hermann Neubacher]], Germany's special envoy to the Balkans, Bulgaria's relation to the Axis powers was completely settled at that meeting. On 23 November, however, the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, [[Peter Draganov]], informed the Germans that while Bulgaria had agreed in principle to join the pact, it wished to delay its signing for the time being.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=33}}\n\nThe meeting with Hitler precipitated a visit to Bulgaria by the Soviet diplomat [[Arkady Sobolev]] on 25 November. He encouraged the Bulgarians to sign a mutual assistance pact that had first been discussed in October 1939. He offered Soviet recognition of Bulgarian claims in Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government, however, was disturbed by the subversive actions of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] in response to the talks, apparently at the Soviets' urging.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=34}}\n\nOn 26 December 1940, the far-right politician [[Alexander Tsankov]] introduced a motion in the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] urging the government to accede to the Tripartite Pact immediately, but it was voted down.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=38}}\n\nBulgaria's hand was finally forced by Germany's desire to intervene in the [[Italo-Greek War]], which would require moving troops through Bulgaria. With no possibility of resisting Germany militarily, Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] signed Bulgaria's accession to the pact in Vienna on 1 March 1941. He announced that it was done partly in gratitude for Germany's assistance to Bulgaria in obtaining the [[Treaty of Craiova]] with Romania and that it would not affect Bulgaria's relations with Turkey or the Soviet Union. Later that day, Ribbentrop promised Filov that after the fall of Greece, Bulgaria would obtain an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coastline between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Maritsa]] Rivers.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}\n\nAccording to Article 17 of the [[Tarnovo Constitution]], treaties had to be ratified by the National Assembly. In the case of the Tripartite Pact, the government sought to have the treaty ratified without debate or discussion. Seventeen opposition deputies submitted an [[interpellation (politics)|interpellation]] and one, Ivan Petrov, asked why the National Assembly had not been consulted in advance and whether the pact involved Bulgaria in war. They were ignored. The pact was ratified by a vote of 140 to 20.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}\n\n===Yugoslavia===\n{{Main|Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact}}\nOn 25 March 1941 in Vienna, [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]], the prime minister of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], signed the Tripartite Pact.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sotirovi\u0107|first=Vladislav B.|date=18 December 2011|title=\u041a\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0452\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0458\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443|publisher=NSPM|url=http://www.nspm.rs/istina-i-pomirenje-na-ex-yu-prostorima/knez-pavle-karadjordjevic-i-pristupanje-jugoslavije-trojnom-paktu.html|language=sr|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925215929/http://www.nspm.rs/istina-i-pomirenje-na-ex-yu-prostorima/knez-pavle-karadjordjevic-i-pristupanje-jugoslavije-trojnom-paktu.html|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On 27 March, the regime was overthrown in [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|a military ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] with British support.

Finland joined Operation Barbarossa on 25 June 1941, which started the [[Continuation War]]. In November, Finland signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anticommunist agreement directed against the Soviet Union, with many other countries allied with Germany. Soon, Germany suggested for Finland to sign the Tripartite Pact, but the Finnish government refused since Finland saw its war as a \"separate war\" from the Second World War and saw its objectives as different from those of Nazi Germany. Finland also wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], particularly the United States. During the Second World War, Germany asked Finland several times to sign the pact but the Finnish government declined all offers. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States were maintained until June 1944 although the US ambassador had already been recalled. The [[United Kingdom]], however, declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 in support of its ally, the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the request of the German command, the Finns established a winter warfare school in [[Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4]]. It began its first two-month course for German officers and [[NCOs]] in December 1941. In the summer of 1942, the German-speaking Finnish instructors taught a course on forest warfare. General [[Waldemar Erfurth]], the German liaison to the Finnish general headquarters, considered the school an outstanding success. It was also attended by some Hungarian officers.{{sfn|DiNardo|1996|p=713}}\n\n===Thailand===\n{{Further|Thailand in World War II}}\n[[File:Thai-German in Berlin 1943.png|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Luang Wichitwathakan]] (centre, standing) and German diplomats, 1943]]\n[[Japanese invasion of Thailand|Japan attacked Thailand]] at 02:00 local time on 8 December 1941. The Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tsubokami, told the Thai foreign minister, [[Direk Jayanama]], that Japan wanted only permission for its troops to pass through Thailand to attack the British in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[British Burma|Burma]]. At 07:00, Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (Phibun) held an emergency cabinet meeting in [[Bangkok]], and soon, a ceasefire was ordered. Phibun then met with Tsubokami, who offered him four options: to conclude a defensive\u2013offensive alliance with Japan, to join the Tripartite Pact, to co-operate in Japanese military operations, or to agree to the joint defence of Thailand. Military co-operation was chosen, and the Tripartite Pact was rejected.{{sfn|Chinvanno|1992|p=13}}\n\nAccording to the postwar memoires of Direk Jayanama, Phibun planned to sign the pact later but was prevented by Direk's opposition.{{sfn|Flood|1970|p=989}}\n\n==Tripartite relations, 1940\u20131943==\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Germany and Italy.jpg|thumb|upright|China's declaration of war against Germany and Italy (9 December 1941) was made on the grounds that the Tripartite Pact banded the allies together \"into a block of aggressor states working closely together to carry out their common program of world conquest and domination\".<ref>[http://www.jvl.leverage.it/china-s-declaration-of-war-against-japan-germany-and-italy-december-1941 China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423154032/http://www.jvl.leverage.it/china-s-declaration-of-war-against-japan-germany-and-italy-december-1941 |date=2017-04-23}} at the Jewish Virtual Library.</ref>]]\nThe \"joint technical commissions\" required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940. They were to consist of a general commission in each capital, consisting of the host's foreign minister and the other two partners' ambassadors. Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions. On 15 December 1941, the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital, Berlin, took place, labelled a \"Tripartite Pact Conference\". It was decided there to form a \"Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers\", but nothing happened for two months. Only the Italians, whom the Japanese mistrusted, pushed for greater collaboration.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nOn 18 January 1942, the German and Italian governments signed two secret operational agreements: one with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and another with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The agreements divided the world along longitude 70\u00b0 east into two major operational zones, but it had almost no military significance. Chiefly, it committed the powers to co-operation in matters of commerce, intelligence and communication.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nOn 24 February 1942, the Permanent Council met under the chairmanship of Ribbentrop, who announced that \"the propaganda effect is one of the main reasons for our meetings\". The representatives set up a propaganda commission and then adjourned indefinitely. The military commission in Berlin met only two or three times by 1943, and there were no trilateral naval talks at all. Germany and Japan conducted separate naval discussions, and Italy consulted the Japanese independently for its planned [[siege of Malta (World War II)|assault on Malta]] in 1942.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\nThe economic relationship between the Tripartite powers was fraught with difficulty. Japan would not grant economic concessions to Germany in 1941 for fear of them ruining [[events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor|its negotiations with the United States]]. In January 1942, negotiations on economic co-operation began, but an agreement was not signed until 20 January 1943 in Berlin. Italy was invited to sign a similar agreement in Rome at the same time for propaganda purposes, but none of the supplementary Berlin protocols applied to Italo-Japanese relations.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n\n==\"No separate peace\" agreement==\nJapan first pressed Germany to join the war with the United States on 2 December 1941, only two days after notifying Berlin of its intention to go to war. Receiving no response, Japan approached Italy. At 04:00 on the morning of 5 December, Ribbentrop gave the Japanese ambassador a proposal, which had been approved by Italy, to join the war and to prosecute it jointly. On 11 December 1941, the same day as the [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|German declaration of war against the United States]] and the [[Italian declaration of war on the United States|Italian declaration]], the three powers signed an agreement, already hammered out on 8 December, barring any separate peace with the United States or Britain. It was \"intended as a propaganda accompaniment to the declaration of war\".{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}\n{{quote|\nARTICLE I. Italy, Germany and Japan will henceforth conduct in common and jointly a war which has been imposed on them by the United States of America and England, by all means at their disposal and until the end of hostilities.\n\nARTICLE II.

This was located midway between the runway ends to facilitate efficient operations. A new building was also constructed to house the Airport Maintenance Engineer, Electronics Engineering section and Stores unit.\n\nExpansion of the Airport Restaurant and Transit Lounge including the refurbishing of the upper level and the provision of a new kitchen was completed in December 1978.\n\nThe next phase of development was the second runway, which was completed three months ahead of schedule and opened in April 1984. This runway, located {{Convert|360|m|abbr=on}} north of the existing runway and parallel to it and is equipped with the latest meteorological, airfield lighting and instrument landing systems to give the airport a Category II classification.\n\nAlso several extensions and upgrades of terminal facilities and supporting systems were carried out.

This use was later made redundant with the availability of Russian airspace due to the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] and the advent of longer-range aircraft introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the [[Airbus A340]], the [[Boeing 747-400]] and the [[Boeing 777]] series aircraft, which had the range to fly between Europe and Southeast Asia nonstop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dubai.airporthotelguide.com/airportinfo.html |title=Dubai International Airport |publisher=Dubai.airporthotelguide.com |accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> [[British Airways]] flights from [[Islamabad]] to [[Manchester]] also stopped for short times during the 1980s.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Air Astana Boeing 737-700; P4-DAS@DXB, December 2005 (4790859684).jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Astana]] [[Boeing 737-700]] taxiing at Dubai International Airport in 2005.]]\n[[File:Azerbaijan Airlines Boeing 707-341C Hoppe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azerbaijan Airlines]] Boeing 707-300 parked at a remote stand at Dubai International Airport in 1995.]]\nThe opening of Terminal 2 in 1998 saw the first step of phase 1 of the new development master plan launched in 1997.

The next step was the reconfiguration of the runways, already part of phase 2, and aprons and taxiways were expanded and strengthened in 2003\u20132004. In addition, the [[Dubai Flower Centre]] opened in 2005 as part of the development.

These included the building of 29 [[gate (airport)|gates]] capable of handling the large aircraft, five of which are in Terminal 3 and two are in Terminal 1. Other important projects at the airport include the next stage of the phase 2 development, which includes the construction of Concourse 3. This will be a smaller version of Concourse 2, which is connected to Terminal 3.\n\nAlso as part of the expansion, the airport is now able to handle at least 75 million (an increase of 19 million) passengers per annum with the opening of Concourse 3, which is part of Terminal 3. However, recent communications predict a further increase to 80 million passengers with additional reassessments of existing capacities. In 2009, Terminal 2 expanded its facilities to handle 5 million (an increase of 2 million) passengers annually, taking the airport's total capacity to 62 million passengers. The [[National aviation authority|Department of Civil Aviation]] has said that Terminal 2 will be continuously upgraded and expanded to bring the total capacity of the airport from the initial 75 million passengers to 80 million passenger capacity by 2012.<ref name=\"gn7762\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfnews.com/BUSINESS/Aviation/10307762.html |title=Concourse 3 to be completed by late 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429083258/http://www.gulfnews.com/business/Aviation/10307762.html |archivedate=29 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe Cargo Mega Terminal, which will have the capacity to handle 3 million tonnes of cargo a year, is a major development; it is going to be built in the long term.

The area was chosen near to [[Dubai]], to attract passengers from the city of Dubai, rather than travel to the busier [[Sharjah International Airport]]. The planned location originally was [[Jebel Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/features/feature1741/feature1741-2.html |title=As a response to soaring passenger numbers, major airport expansion projects are taking place throughout the UAE. |publisher=Airport Technology |accessdate=16 July 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and one runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 70 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance [[hangar]], the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and an {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}} [[Air traffic control|control tower]]. Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 50 new aircraft parking bays in addition to the existing 70 bays, a second fire station and a third cargo agent building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |title=$82 bn earmarked for Dubai airport expansion |publisher=Projectsmonitor.com |date=22 October 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123910/http://old.projectsmonitor.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=14744 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe third phase included construction of a new terminal (now the parts of Terminal 1's main building and Concourse C) and an additional 60 parking bays, as well as new aircraft maintenance facility. Then, in the early 2000s (decade) a new master plan was introduced which began the development of the current concourses and terminal infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |title=Dubai International Airport [DXB/OMDB&#93; \u2013 TEN Travel & Tourism [UAE&#93; |publisher=Travel.theemiratesnetwork.com |accessdate=16 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125185212/http://travel.theemiratesnetwork.com/airports/dubai.php |archivedate=25 November 2010  }}</ref>\n\nPaul Griffiths (Dubai Airports' CEO) in his interview to ''[[Vision (magazine)|Vision]]'' magazine, cited plans to build infrastructure to support the expansion of Emirates and budget airline flydubai, and ascend the ranks of global aviation hubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vision.ae/en/special_report/delivering_the_vision_dubai_international_airport|title=Dubai Airport \u2013 Delivering the vision...

Terminals 1 and 3 are directly connected with a common transit area, with airside passengers being able to move freely between the terminals without going through immigration, while Terminal 2 is on the opposite side of the airport. For transiting passengers, a shuttle service runs between the terminals, with a journey time of around 20 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 and 30 minutes to Terminal 3. Passengers in Terminal 3 who need to transfer between concourse A and the rest of the Terminal have to travel via an automated [[people mover]]. Also after early 2016 when the construction of Concourse D was done, there is now an automated people mover between concourse D and Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-build-automated-people-mover-system-dubai-airport|title=Bombardier to build automated people mover system at Dubai Airport|accessdate=1 June 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSituated beside Terminal 2 is the Executive Flights Terminal, which has its own [[Airport check-in|check-in]] facilities for premium passengers and where transportation to aircraft in any of the other terminals is by personal buggy.\n\nThe three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of around 80&nbsp;million passengers a year.\n\nTerminals 1 and 3 cater to international passengers, whilst Terminal 2 is for budget passengers and passengers flying to the subcontinent and Persian Gulf region; Terminals 1 and 3 handle 85% of the passenger traffic and the Executive Flights terminal is for the higher-end travellers and important guests.\n\n====Terminal 1====\nTerminal 1 has a capacity of 15 million passengers. It is used by over 100 airlines and is connected to Concourse D by an automated people mover. It is spread over an area of {{convert|520000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and offers 221 check-in counters.\n\nThe Terminal was originally built to handle 18 million passengers; however, with extreme congestion at the terminal, the airport was forced to expand the terminal to accommodate with the opening of 28 remote gates. Over the years, more mobile gates were added to the airport bringing the total as of 2010 to 28.\n\nIn 2013, Dubai Airports announced a major renovation for Terminal 1 and Concourse C. The renovations include upgraded baggage systems, replacement of check-in desks and a more spacious departure hall. Arrivals will also see improvements to help reduce waiting times. The renovation was completed by the middle of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/major-renovations-planned-for-dubai-airports-terminal-1|title=Major renovations planned for Dubai Airport's Terminal 1|author=Ramola Talwar Badam|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Concourse D\nPlanning begun for further expansion of Dubai Airport, with the construction of Terminal 4, it was revealed on the day Emirates completed its phased operations at the new Terminal 3, on 14 November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|title=Dubai Airports: No decision yet on Terminal 4|publisher=ArabianBusiness.com|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=16 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206045621/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|archive-date=6 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nAccording to Dubai Airport officials, plans for Terminal 4 had begun and extensions would be made to Terminal 3.

It also will see [[The Emirates Group|Emirates]] take over the operation at Concourse C, along with concourse A and B which it will already be operating. All remaining airlines will shift to Concourse D, or move to [[Al Maktoum International Airport]]. The airport projects that international passenger and cargo traffic will increase at an average annual growth rate of 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively, and that by 2020 passenger numbers at Dubai International Airport will reach 98.5 million and cargo volumes will top 4.1 million tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/dubai-airports-to-launch-plans-for-concourse-4-this-year-1.802950?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Dubai Airports to launch plans for Concourse 4 this year |publisher=gulfnews |date=4 May 2011|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nConcourse D will have a capacity of 15 million passengers, include 17 gates and will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automated people mover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zawya.com/story/Dubai_Airport_to_handle_200_million_passengers_by_2030-ZAWYA20150313034436/ |title=Dubai Airport to handle 200 million passengers by 2030 |publisher=Zawya |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> On 6 February 2016, members of the public were invited to trial the concourse in preparation for its opening.

The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. In addition to the two gates at Terminal 1, five more A380-capable gates were opened at concourse B on 14 October 2008. Concourse A opened on 2 January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-opens-new-a380-airport-terminal-484277.html |title=Dubai opens new A380 airport terminal \u2013 Transport |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Labor controversy==\nMost of the staff employed at construction sites across the country are foreign short-term workers from neighboring Arab states and [[Southeast Asia]].

This was located midway between the runway ends to facilitate efficient operations. A new building was also constructed to house the Airport Maintenance Engineer, Electronics Engineering section and Stores unit.\n\nExpansion of the Airport Restaurant and Transit Lounge including the refurbishing of the upper level and the provision of a new kitchen was completed in December 1978.\n\nThe next phase of development was the second runway, which was completed three months ahead of schedule and opened in April 1984. This runway, located {{Convert|360|m|abbr=on}} north of the existing runway and parallel to it and is equipped with the latest meteorological, airfield lighting and instrument landing systems to give the airport a Category II classification.\n\nAlso several extensions and upgrades of terminal facilities and supporting systems were carried out. On 23 December 1980 the airport became an ordinary member of the [[Airports Council International]] (ACI).\n\nDuring the 1980s, Dubai was a stopping point for airlines such as Air India, [[Cathay Pacific]], Singapore Airlines, [[Malaysia Airlines]] and others travelling between Asia and Europe that needed a refuelling point in the [[Persian Gulf]]. This use was later made redundant with the availability of Russian airspace due to the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] and the advent of longer-range aircraft introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the [[Airbus A340]], the [[Boeing 747-400]] and the [[Boeing 777]] series aircraft, which had the range to fly between Europe and Southeast Asia nonstop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dubai.airporthotelguide.com/airportinfo.html |title=Dubai International Airport |publisher=Dubai.airporthotelguide.com |accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> [[British Airways]] flights from [[Islamabad]] to [[Manchester]] also stopped for short times during the 1980s.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Air Astana Boeing 737-700; P4-DAS@DXB, December 2005 (4790859684).jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Astana]] [[Boeing 737-700]] taxiing at Dubai International Airport in 2005.]]\n[[File:Azerbaijan Airlines Boeing 707-341C Hoppe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azerbaijan Airlines]] Boeing 707-300 parked at a remote stand at Dubai International Airport in 1995.]]\nThe opening of Terminal 2 in 1998 saw the first step of phase 1 of the new development master plan launched in 1997. As the second stage, Concourse 1 opened in April 2000 under the name of Sheikh Rashid Terminal. The concourse is {{convert|0.8|km|abbr=on}} in length and connects to the check-in area by a {{convert|0.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} tunnel containing [[moving walkway]]s (conveyor belt/travelators). It also contains a hotel, business centre, health club, exchanges, dining and entertainment facilities, internet services, medical centre, post office and a prayer room. The next step was the reconfiguration of the runways, already part of phase 2, and aprons and taxiways were expanded and strengthened in 2003\u20132004. In addition, the [[Dubai Flower Centre]] opened in 2005 as part of the development. The airport saw the need for this as the city is a hub for import and export of flowers and the airport required a specialist facility since flowers need special conditions.<ref name=\"airport-technology1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airport.ae/dubai-international-airport.html |title=Airport.ae |publisher=Airport.ae |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920115819/http://www.airport.ae/dubai-international-airport.html |archivedate=20 September 2010  }}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Terminal 3 began in 2004 as the next stage of phase 2 of the development, with an estimated cost of around $4.55&nbsp;billion.

The terminal became operational on 14 October 2008, with Emirates Airline (EK2926) from [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, being the first flight to arrive at the new terminal and EK843 to [[Doha]], Qatar being the first departing flight.

These included the building of 29 [[gate (airport)|gates]] capable of handling the large aircraft, five of which are in Terminal 3 and two are in Terminal 1. Other important projects at the airport include the next stage of the phase 2 development, which includes the construction of Concourse 3. This will be a smaller version of Concourse 2, which is connected to Terminal 3.\n\nAlso as part of the expansion, the airport is now able to handle at least 75 million (an increase of 19 million) passengers per annum with the opening of Concourse 3, which is part of Terminal 3. However, recent communications predict a further increase to 80 million passengers with additional reassessments of existing capacities. In 2009, Terminal 2 expanded its facilities to handle 5 million (an increase of 2 million) passengers annually, taking the airport's total capacity to 62 million passengers. The [[National aviation authority|Department of Civil Aviation]] has said that Terminal 2 will be continuously upgraded and expanded to bring the total capacity of the airport from the initial 75 million passengers to 80 million passenger capacity by 2012.<ref name=\"gn7762\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfnews.com/BUSINESS/Aviation/10307762.html |title=Concourse 3 to be completed by late 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429083258/http://www.gulfnews.com/business/Aviation/10307762.html |archivedate=29 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe Cargo Mega Terminal, which will have the capacity to handle 3 million tonnes of cargo a year, is a major development; it is going to be built in the long term.

The area was chosen near to [[Dubai]], to attract passengers from the city of Dubai, rather than travel to the busier [[Sharjah International Airport]]. The planned location originally was [[Jebel Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/features/feature1741/feature1741-2.html |title=As a response to soaring passenger numbers, major airport expansion projects are taking place throughout the UAE. |publisher=Airport Technology |accessdate=16 July 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe original master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and one runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 70 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance [[hangar]], the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}} [[Air traffic control|control tower]].

For transiting passengers, a shuttle service runs between the terminals, with a journey time of around 20 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 and 30 minutes to Terminal 3. Passengers in Terminal 3 who need to transfer between concourse A and the rest of the Terminal have to travel via an automated [[people mover]]. Also after early 2016 when the construction of Concourse D was done, there is now an automated people mover between concourse D and Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-build-automated-people-mover-system-dubai-airport|title=Bombardier to build automated people mover system at Dubai Airport|accessdate=1 June 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSituated beside Terminal 2 is the Executive Flights Terminal, which has its own [[Airport check-in|check-in]] facilities for premium passengers and where transportation to aircraft in any of the other terminals is by personal buggy.\n\nThe three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of around 80&nbsp;million passengers a year.\n\nTerminals 1 and 3 cater to international passengers, whilst Terminal 2 is for budget passengers and passengers flying to the subcontinent and Persian Gulf region; Terminals 1 and 3 handle 85% of the passenger traffic and the Executive Flights terminal is for the higher-end travellers and important guests.\n\n====Terminal 1====\nTerminal 1 has a capacity of 15 million passengers. It is used by over 100 airlines and is connected to Concourse D by an automated people mover. It is spread over an area of {{convert|520000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and offers 221 check-in counters.\n\nThe Terminal was originally built to handle 18 million passengers; however, with extreme congestion at the terminal, the airport was forced to expand the terminal to accommodate with the opening of 28 remote gates. Over the years, more mobile gates were added to the airport bringing the total as of 2010 to 28.\n\nIn 2013, Dubai Airports announced a major renovation for Terminal 1 and Concourse C. The renovations include upgraded baggage systems, replacement of check-in desks and a more spacious departure hall. Arrivals will also see improvements to help reduce waiting times. The renovation was completed by the middle of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/major-renovations-planned-for-dubai-airports-terminal-1|title=Major renovations planned for Dubai Airport's Terminal 1|author=Ramola Talwar Badam|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Concourse D\nPlanning begun for further expansion of Dubai Airport, with the construction of Terminal 4, it was revealed on the day Emirates completed its phased operations at the new Terminal 3, on 14 November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|title=Dubai Airports: No decision yet on Terminal 4|publisher=ArabianBusiness.com|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=16 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206045621/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/538287-dubai-airports-no-decision-yet-on-terminal-4|archive-date=6 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nAccording to Dubai Airport officials, plans for Terminal 4 had begun and extensions would be made to Terminal 3.

The northern runway was resurfaced while lighting upgrades and additional taxiways were built on the southern runway to help boost its capacity.

The [[Department of Civil Aviation]] spent $120 million in upgrading both of its terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate holdrooms, new finger piers, an enlarged runway, new airbridges and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{convert|70|to|90|m|abbr=on}}. Dubai Airport also invested $3.5 billion into a new Concourse A, exclusively for handling Emirates A380s. With the changes made, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does for Boeing 747-400s, which carry fewer passengers. On 16 July 2008, Dubai Airport unveiled the first of two specially-built gates capable of handling the aircraft. Costing $10 million, the gates will enable passengers to get on the upper cabin of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. In addition to the two gates at Terminal 1, five more A380-capable gates were opened at concourse B on 14 October 2008. Concourse A opened on 2 January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-opens-new-a380-airport-terminal-484277.html |title=Dubai opens new A380 airport terminal \u2013 Transport |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Labor controversy==\nMost of the staff employed at construction sites across the country are foreign short-term workers from neighboring Arab states and [[Southeast Asia]].
