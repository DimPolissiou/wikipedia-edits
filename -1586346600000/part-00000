A '''solution''' to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A [[Equation solving|solution]] to the system above is given by\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\nx &\\,=\\,& 1 \\\\\ny &\\,=\\,& -2 \\\\\nz &\\,=\\,& -2\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nsince it makes all three equations valid. The word \"system\" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.\n\nIn mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of [[linear algebra]], a subject which is used in most parts of modern mathematics. Computational [[algorithm]]s for finding the solutions are an important part of [[numerical linear algebra]], and play a prominent role in [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. A [[Nonlinear system|system of non-linear equations]] can often be [[approximation|approximated]] by a linear system (see [[linearization]]), a helpful technique when making a [[mathematical model]] or [[computer simulation]] of a relatively [[complex system]].\n\nVery often, the [[coefficient]]s of the equations are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s and the solutions are searched in the same set of numbers, but the theory and the algorithms apply for coefficients and solutions in any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. For solutions in an [[integral domain]] like the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of the [[integer]]s, or in other [[algebraic structure]]s, other theories have been developed, see [[Linear equation over a ring]]. [[Integer linear programming]] is a collection of methods for finding the \"best\" integer solution (when there are many). [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] theory provides algorithms when coefficients and unknowns are [[polynomial]]s. Also [[tropical geometry]] is an example of linear algebra in a more exotic structure.\n\n==Elementary examples==\n===Trivial example===\nThe system of one equation in one unknown\n:<math>2x = 4</math>\nhas the solution \n:<math>x = 2.</math>\n\nHowever, a linear system is commonly considered as having at least two equations.\n\n===Simple nontrivial example===\nThe simplest kind of nontrivial linear system involves two equations and two variables:\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; = \\;&& 6 & \\\\\n4x &&\\; + \\;&& 9y &&\\; = \\;&& 15&.\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nOne method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for <math>x</math> in terms of <math>y</math>:\n\n:<math>x = 3 - \\frac{3}{2}y.</math>\n\nNow [[substitution (algebra)|substitute]] this expression for ''x'' into the bottom equation:\n\n:<math>4\\left( 3 - \\frac{3}{2}y \\right) + 9y = 15.</math>\n\nThis results in a single equation involving only the variable <math>y</math>. Solving gives <math>y = 1</math>, and substituting this back into the equation for <math>x</math> yields <math>x = 3/2</math>. This method generalizes to systems with additional variables (see \"elimination of variables\" below, or the article on [[elementary algebra]].)\n\n==General form==\nA general system of ''m'' linear equations with ''n'' unknowns can be written as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{1n} x_n  &= b_1 \\\\\na_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{2n} x_n  &= b_2 \\\\\n& \\ \\ \\vdots\\\\\na_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{mn} x_n  &= b_ m,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>x_1, x_2,\\ldots,x_n</math> are the unknowns, <math>a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{mn}</math> are the coefficients of the system, and <math>b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_m</math> are the constant terms.\n\nOften the coefficients and unknowns are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, but [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s are also seen, as are polynomials and elements of an abstract [[algebraic structure]].\n\n===Vector equation===\nOne extremely helpful view is that each unknown is a weight for a [[column vector]] in a [[linear combination]].\n:<math>\n x_1 \\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}\\\\a_{21}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{m1}\\end{bmatrix} +\n x_2 \\begin{bmatrix}a_{12}\\\\a_{22}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{m2}\\end{bmatrix} +\n \\cdots +\n x_n \\begin{bmatrix}a_{1n}\\\\a_{2n}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{mn}\\end{bmatrix}\n =\n \\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\\\b_2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\b_m\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThis allows all the language and theory of ''[[vector space]]s'' (or more generally, ''[[module (mathematics)|module]]s'') to be brought to bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side is called their ''[[span (linear algebra)|span]]'', and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a ''[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]'' of [[linearly independent]] vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its ''[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]'') cannot be larger than ''m'' or ''n'', but it can be smaller. This is important because if we have ''m'' independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side, and otherwise not guaranteed.\n\n===Matrix equation===\nThe vector equation is equivalent to a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation of the form\n:<math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math>\nwhere ''A'' is an ''m''\u00d7''n'' matrix, '''x''' is a [[column vector]] with ''n'' entries, and '''b''' is a column vector with ''m'' entries.\n: <math>\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n\\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n\\mathbf{x}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_n\n\\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n\\mathbf{b}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_1 \\\\\nb_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nb_m\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThe number of vectors in a basis for the span is now expressed as the ''[[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]'' of the matrix.\n\n==Solution set==\n[[Image:Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for the equations {{nowrap|''x'' &minus; ''y'' {{=}} &minus;1}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + ''y'' {{=}} 9}} is the single point (2,&nbsp;3).]]\nA '''solution''' of a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''}} such that each of the equations is satisfied. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible solutions is called the '''[[solution set]]'''.\n\nA linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:\n# The system has ''infinitely many solutions''.\n# The system has a single ''unique solution''.\n# The system has ''no solution''.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nFor a system involving two variables (''x'' and ''y''), each linear equation determines a [[line (mathematics)|line]] on the ''xy''-[[Cartesian coordinate system|plane]]. Because a solution to a linear system must satisfy all of the equations, the solution set is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of these lines, and is hence either a line, a single point, or the [[empty set]].\n\nFor three variables, each linear equation determines a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] in [[three-dimensional space]], and the solution set is the intersection of these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set. For example, as three parallel planes do not have a common point, the solution set of their equations is empty; the solution set of the equations of three planes intersecting at a point is single point; if three planes pass through two points, their equations have at least two common solutions; in fact the solution set is infinite and consists in all the line passing through these points.<ref name=\"Linear Matrices\">{{cite book |isbn= 978-0-486-66328-9|url= https://www.amazon.com/Matrices-Linear-Transformations-Edition-Mathematics/dp/0486663280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400776703&sr=8-1&keywords=cullen+matrices |title=Matrices and Linear Transformations |author=Charles G. Cullen |location= MA |publisher=Dover| year=1990 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nFor ''n'' variables, each linear equation determines a [[hyperplane]] in [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. The solution set is the intersection of these hyperplanes, and is a [[flat (geometry)|flat]], which may have any dimension lower than ''n''.\n\n===General behavior===\n[[File:Intersecting Planes 2.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for two equations in three variables is, in general, a line.]]\nIn general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns. Here, \"in general\" means that a different behavior may occur for specific values of the coefficients of the equations.\n* In general, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such a system is known as an [[underdetermined system]].\n* In general, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.\n* In general, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an [[overdetermined system]].\nIn the first case, the [[dimension]] of the solution set is, in general, equal to {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; ''m''}}, where ''n'' is the number of variables and ''m'' is the number of equations.\n\nThe following pictures illustrate this trichotomy in the case of two variables:\n:{| border=0 cellpadding=5\n|-\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:One Line.svg|120px]]\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:Two Lines.svg|120px]]\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:Three Lines.svg|120px]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| One equation\n|align=\"center\"| Two equations\n|align=\"center\"| Three equations\n|}\nThe first system has infinitely many solutions, namely all of the points on the blue line. The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines. The third system has no solutions, since the three lines share no common point.\n\nIt must be kept in mind that the pictures above show only the most common case (the general case). It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point).\n\nA system of linear equations behave differently from the general case if the equations are ''[[linear independence|linearly dependent]]'', or if it is ''[[#Consistency|inconsistent]]'' and has no more equations than unknowns.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Independence===\nThe equations of a linear system are '''independent''' if none of the equations can be derived algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases the size of the solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as [[linear independence]].\n\n[[Image:Three Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|''x'' &minus; 2''y'' {{=}} &minus;1}}, {{nowrap|3''x'' + 5''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and {{nowrap|4''x'' + 3''y'' {{=}} 7}} are linearly dependent.]]\nFor example, the equations\n:<math>3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;6x+4y=12</math>\nare not independent \u2014 they are the same equation when scaled by a factor of two, and they would produce identical graphs. This is an example of equivalence in a system of linear equations.\n\nFor a more complicated example, the equations\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n x &&\\; - \\;&& 2y &&\\; = \\;&& -1 & \\\\\n 3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; = \\;&& 8 & \\\\\n 4x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; = \\;&& 7 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nare not independent, because the third equation is the sum of the other two. Indeed, any one of these equations can be derived from the other two, and any one of the equations can be removed without affecting the solution set. The graphs of these equations are three lines that intersect at a single point.\n\n===Consistency===\n{{See also|Consistent and inconsistent equations}}\n[[Image:Parallel Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 6}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 12}} are inconsistent.]]\nA linear system is '''inconsistent''' if it has no solution, and otherwise it is said to be '''consistent'''. When the system is inconsistent, it is possible to derive a [[contradiction]] from the equations, that may always be rewritten as the statement {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}.\n\nFor example, the equations\n:<math>3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;3x+2y=12</math>\nare inconsistent. In fact, by subtracting the first equation from the second one and multiplying both sides of the result by 1/6, we get {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}. The graphs of these equations on the ''xy''-plane are a pair of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.\n\nIt is possible for three linear equations to be inconsistent, even though any two of them are consistent together. For example, the equations\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& y &&\\; = \\;&& 1 & \\\\\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& y &&\\; = \\;&& 1 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 2y &&\\; = \\;&& 3 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nare inconsistent. Adding the first two equations together gives {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 2}}, which can be subtracted from the third equation to yield {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}. Any two of these equations have a common solution. The same phenomenon can occur for any number of equations.\n\nIn general, inconsistencies occur if the left-hand sides of the equations in a system are linearly dependent, and the constant terms do not satisfy the dependence relation. A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.\n\nPutting it another way, according to the [[Rouch\u00e9\u2013Capelli theorem]], any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the [[augmented matrix]] is greater than the rank of the [[coefficient matrix]]. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has ''k'' free parameters where ''k'' is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions. The rank of a system of equations (i.e. the rank of the augmented matrix) can never be higher than [the number of variables] + 1, which means that a system with any number of equations can always be reduced to a system that has a number of [[independent equation]]s that is at most equal to [the number of variables] + 1.\n\n===Equivalence===\nTwo linear systems using the same set of variables are '''equivalent''' if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice versa. Two systems are equivalent if either both are inconsistent or each equation of each of them is a linear combination of the equations of the other one. It follows that two linear systems are equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set.\n\n==Solving a linear system==\nThere are several [[algorithm]]s for [[equation solving|solving]] a system of linear equations.\n\n===Describing the solution===\nWhen the solution set is finite, it is reduced to a single element. In this case, the unique solution is described by a sequence of equations whose left-hand sides are the names of the unknowns and right-hand sides are the corresponding values, for example <math>(x=3, \\;y=-2,\\; z=6)</math>. When an order on the unknowns has been fixed, for example the [[alphabetical order]] the solution may be described as a [[vector space|vector]] of values, like <math>(3, \\,-2,\\, 6)</math> for the previous example.\n\nTo describe a set with an infinite number of solutions, typically some of the variables are designated as '''free''' (or '''independent''', or as '''parameters'''), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining variables are '''dependent''' on the values of the free variables.\n\nFor example, consider the following system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; - \\;&& 2z &&\\; = \\;&& 5 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; + \\;&& 6z &&\\; = \\;&& 7 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nThe solution set to this system can be described by the following equations:\n:<math>x=-7z-1\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;y=3z+2\\text{.}</math>\nHere ''z'' is the free variable, while ''x'' and ''y'' are dependent on ''z''. Any point in the solution set can be obtained by first choosing a value for ''z'', and then computing the corresponding values for ''x'' and ''y''.\n\nEach free variable gives the solution space one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]], the number of which is equal to the [[dimension]] of the solution set. For example, the solution set for the above equation is a line, since a point in the solution set can be chosen by specifying the value of the parameter ''z''. An infinite solution of higher order may describe a plane, or higher-dimensional set.\n\nDifferent choices for the free variables may lead to different descriptions of the same solution set. For example, the solution to the above equations can alternatively be described as follows:\n:<math>y=-\\frac{3}{7}x + \\frac{11}{7}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;z=-\\frac{1}{7}x-\\frac{1}{7}\\text{.}</math>\nHere ''x'' is the free variable, and ''y'' and ''z'' are dependent.\n\n===Elimination of variables===\nThe simplest method for solving a system of linear equations is to repeatedly eliminate variables. This method can be described as follows:\n# In the first equation, solve for one of the variables in terms of the others.\n# Substitute this expression into the remaining equations. This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and one fewer unknown.\n# Repeat until the system is reduced to a single linear equation.\n# Solve this equation, and then back-substitute until the entire solution is found.\n\nFor example, consider the following system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; - \\;&& 2z &&\\; = \\;&& 5 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; + \\;&& 6z &&\\; = \\;&& 7 & \\\\\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& 4y &&\\; + \\;&& 3z &&\\; = \\;&& 8 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSolving the first equation for ''x'' gives {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 5 + 2''z'' &minus; 3''y''}}, and plugging this into the second and third equation yields\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n-4y &&\\; + \\;&& 12z &&\\; = \\;&& -8 & \\\\\n-2y &&\\; + \\;&& 7z &&\\; = \\;&& -2 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSolving the first of these equations for ''y'' yields {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 2 + 3''z''}}, and plugging this into the second equation yields {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. We now have:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; = \\;&& 5 &&\\; + \\;&& 2z &&\\; - \\;&& 3y & \\\\\n y &&\\; = \\;&& 2 &&\\; + \\;&& 3z && && & \\\\\n z &&\\; = \\;&& 2 && && && && &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSubstituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} into the second equation gives {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and substituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} and {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}} into the first equation yields {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &minus;15}}. Therefore, the solution set is the single point {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (&minus;15, 8, 2)}}.\n\n===Row reduction===\n{{main|Gaussian elimination}}\nIn '''row reduction''' (also known as '''Gaussian elimination'''), the linear system is represented as an [[augmented matrix]]:\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]\\text{.}\n</math>\nThis matrix is then modified using [[elementary row operations]] until it reaches [[reduced row echelon form]]. There are three types of elementary row operations:\n:'''Type 1''': Swap the positions of two rows.\n:'''Type 2''': Multiply a row by a nonzero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].\n:'''Type 3''': Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.\nBecause these operations are reversible, the augmented matrix produced always represents a linear system that is equivalent to the original.\n\nThere are several specific algorithms to row-reduce an augmented matrix, the simplest of which are [[Gaussian elimination]] and [[Gauss-Jordan elimination]]. The following computation shows Gauss-Jordan elimination applied to the matrix above:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]&\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 7 & -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 7 & -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\\\\n&\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 0 & 0 & -15 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align}</math>\nThe last matrix is in reduced row echelon form, and represents the system {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &minus;15}}, {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. A comparison with the example in the previous section on the algebraic elimination of variables shows that these two methods are in fact the same; the difference lies in how the computations are written down.\n\n===Cramer's rule===\n{{main|Cramer's rule}}\n'''Cramer's rule''' is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations, with each variable given by a quotient of two [[determinant]]s. For example, the solution to the system\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &\\; + &\\; 3y &\\; - &\\; 2z &\\; = &\\; 5 \\\\\n3x &\\; + &\\; 5y &\\; + &\\; 6z &\\; = &\\; 7 \\\\\n2x &\\; + &\\; 4y &\\; + &\\; 3z &\\; = &\\; 8 \n\\end{alignat}</math>\nis given by\n:<math>\nx=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}5&3&-2\\\\7&5&6\\\\8&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n,\\;\\;\\;\\;y=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&5&-2\\\\3&7&6\\\\2&8&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n,\\;\\;\\;\\;z=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&5\\\\3&5&7\\\\2&4&8\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}.\n</math>\nFor each variable, the denominator is the determinant of the [[matrix of coefficients]], while the numerator is the determinant of a matrix in which one column has been replaced by the vector of constant terms.\n\nThough Cramer's rule is important theoretically, it has little practical value for large matrices, since the computation of large determinants is somewhat cumbersome. (Indeed, large determinants are most easily computed using row reduction.)\nFurther, Cramer's rule has very poor numerical properties, making it unsuitable for solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Matrix solution===\n\nIf the equation system is expressed in the matrix form <math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math>, the entire solution set can also be expressed in matrix form. If the matrix ''A'' is square (has ''m'' rows and ''n''=''m'' columns) and has full rank (all ''m'' rows are independent), then the system has a unique solution given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A^{-1}</math> is the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of ''A''. More generally, regardless of whether ''m''=''n'' or not and regardless of the rank of ''A'', all solutions (if any exist) are given using the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]] of ''A'', denoted <math>A^+</math>, as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}=A^+ \\mathbf{b} + (I-A^+ A)\\mathbf{w}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> is a vector of free parameters that ranges over all possible ''n''\u00d71 vectors. A necessary and sufficient condition for any solution(s) to exist is that the potential solution obtained using <math>\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}</math> satisfy <math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math> &mdash; that is, that <math>AA^+ \\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}.</math> If this condition does not hold, the equation system is inconsistent and has no solution. If the condition holds, the system is consistent and at least one solution exists. For example, in the above-mentioned case in which ''A'' is square and of full rank, <math>A^+</math> simply equals <math>A^{-1}</math> and the general solution equation simplifies to <math>\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} + (I - A^{-1}A)\\mathbf{w} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} + (I-I)\\mathbf{w} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}</math> as previously stated, where <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> has completely dropped out of the solution, leaving only a single solution.  In other cases, though, <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> remains and hence an infinitude of potential values of the free parameter vector <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> give an infinitude of solutions of the equation.\n\n===Other methods===\nWhile systems of three or four equations can be readily solved by hand (see [[Cracovian]]), computers are often used for larger systems. The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as [[Pivot element|''pivoting'']]. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the [[LU decomposition]] of the matrix ''A''. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix ''A'' but different vectors '''b'''.\n\nIf the matrix ''A'' has some special structure, this can be exploited to obtain faster or more accurate algorithms. For instance, systems with a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix can be solved twice as fast with the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. [[Levinson recursion]] is a fast method for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrices]]. Special methods exist also for matrices with many zero elements (so-called [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]), which appear often in applications.\n\nA completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have to be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of [[iterative method]]s.\n\nThere is also a [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]].<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\">[https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171 Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, by Harrow et al.].</ref>\n\n==Homogeneous systems==\n{{see also|Homogeneous differential equation}}\nA system of linear equations is '''homogeneous''' if all of the constant terms are zero:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\na_{11} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{12} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{1n} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0 \\\\\na_{21} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{22} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{2n} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0 \\\\\n\\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&              && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     &&& \\,\\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{m2} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{mn} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0. \\\\\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nA homogeneous system is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form\n:<math>A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0}</math>\nwhere ''A'' is an {{nowrap|''m'' &times; ''n''}} matrix, '''x''' is a column vector with ''n'' entries, and '''0''' is the [[zero vector]] with ''m'' entries.\n\n===Homogeneous solution set===\nEvery homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the ''zero'' (or ''trivial'') solution, which is obtained by assigning the value of zero to each of the variables. If the system has a [[non-singular matrix]] ({{math|det(''A'') \u2260 0}}) then it is also the only solution.  If the system has a singular matrix then there is a solution set with an infinite number of solutions.  This solution set has the following additional properties:\n# If '''u''' and '''v''' are two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] representing solutions to a homogeneous system, then the vector sum {{nowrap|'''u''' + '''v'''}} is also a solution to the system.\n# If '''u''' is a vector representing a solution to a homogeneous system, and ''r'' is any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], then ''r'''''u''' is also a solution to the system.\nThese are exactly the properties required for the solution set to be a [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. In particular, the solution set to a homogeneous system is the same as the [[Kernel (matrix)|null space]] of the corresponding matrix ''A''.\nNumerical solutions to a homogeneous system can be found with a [[Singular value decomposition#Solving homogeneous linear equations|singular value decomposition]].\n\n===Relation to nonhomogeneous systems===\nThere is a close relationship between the solutions to a linear system and the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous system:\n:<math>A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0}\\text{.}</math>\nSpecifically, if '''p''' is any specific solution to the linear system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}}, then the entire solution set can be described as\n:<math>\\left\\{ \\textbf{p}+\\textbf{v} : \\textbf{v}\\text{ is any solution to }A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0} \\right\\}.</math>\nGeometrically, this says that the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''0'''}}. Specifically, the [[flat (geometry)|flat]] for the first system can be obtained by translating the [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] for the homogeneous system by the vector '''p'''.\n\nThis reasoning only applies if the system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} has at least one solution. This occurs if and only if the vector '''b''' lies in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the [[linear transformation]] ''A''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arrangement of hyperplanes]]\n* [[Iterative refinement]]\n* [[Coates graph]]\n* [[LAPACK]] (the free standard package to solve linear equations numerically; available in [[Fortran]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]])\n* [[Linear equation over a ring]]\n* [[Linear least squares (mathematics)|Linear least squares]]\n* [[Matrix decomposition]]\n* [[Matrix splitting]]\n* [[NAG Numerical Library]] (NAG Library versions of LAPACK solvers) \n* [[Simultaneous equations]]\n* [[Moore\u2013Penrose pseudoinverse]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{ citation | last1 = Anton | first1 = Howard | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-471-84819-0 | title = Elementary Linear Algebra | edition = 5th | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | location = New York }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Beauregard | first1 = Raymond A. | last2 = Fraleigh | first2 = John B. | title = A First Course In Linear Algebra: with Optional Introduction to Groups, Rings, and Fields | location = Boston | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Company]] | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-395-14017-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/firstcourseinlin0000beau }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Burden | first1 = Richard L. | last2 = Faires | first2 = J.

Computational [[algorithm]]s for finding the solutions are an important part of [[numerical linear algebra]], and play a prominent role in [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. A [[Nonlinear system|system of non-linear equations]] can often be [[approximation|approximated]] by a linear system (see [[linearization]]), a helpful technique when making a [[mathematical model]] or [[computer simulation]] of a relatively [[complex system]].\n\nVery often, the [[coefficient]]s of the equations are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s and the solutions are searched in the same set of numbers, but the theory and the algorithms apply for coefficients and solutions in any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. For solutions in an [[integral domain]] like the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of the [[integer]]s, or in other [[algebraic structure]]s, other theories have been developed, see [[Linear equation over a ring]]. [[Integer linear programming]] is a collection of methods for finding the \"best\" integer solution (when there are many). [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] theory provides algorithms when coefficients and unknowns are [[polynomial]]s. Also [[tropical geometry]] is an example of linear algebra in a more exotic structure.\n\n==Elementary examples==\n===Trivial example===\nThe system of one equation in one unknown\n:<math>2x = 4</math>\nhas the solution \n:<math>x = 2.</math>\n\nHowever, a linear system is commonly considered as having at least two equations.\n\n===Simple nontrivial example===\nThe simplest kind of nontrivial linear system involves two equations and two variables:\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; = \\;&& 6 & \\\\\n4x &&\\; + \\;&& 9y &&\\; = \\;&& 15&.\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nOne method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for <math>x</math> in terms of <math>y</math>:\n\n:<math>x = 3 - \\frac{3}{2}y.</math>\n\nNow [[substitution (algebra)|substitute]] this expression for ''x'' into the bottom equation:\n\n:<math>4\\left( 3 - \\frac{3}{2}y \\right) + 9y = 15.</math>\n\nThis results in a single equation involving only the variable <math>y</math>. Solving gives <math>y = 1</math>, and substituting this back into the equation for <math>x</math> yields <math>x = 3/2</math>. This method generalizes to systems with additional variables (see \"elimination of variables\" below, or the article on [[elementary algebra]].)\n\n==General form==\nA general system of ''m'' linear equations with ''n'' unknowns can be written as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{1n} x_n  &= b_1 \\\\\na_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{2n} x_n  &= b_2 \\\\\n& \\ \\ \\vdots\\\\\na_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2  + \\cdots + a_{mn} x_n  &= b_ m,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>x_1, x_2,\\ldots,x_n</math> are the unknowns, <math>a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{mn}</math> are the coefficients of the system, and <math>b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_m</math> are the constant terms.\n\nOften the coefficients and unknowns are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, but [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s are also seen, as are polynomials and elements of an abstract [[algebraic structure]].\n\n===Vector equation===\nOne extremely helpful view is that each unknown is a weight for a [[column vector]] in a [[linear combination]].\n:<math>\n x_1 \\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}\\\\a_{21}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{m1}\\end{bmatrix} +\n x_2 \\begin{bmatrix}a_{12}\\\\a_{22}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{m2}\\end{bmatrix} +\n \\cdots +\n x_n \\begin{bmatrix}a_{1n}\\\\a_{2n}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\a_{mn}\\end{bmatrix}\n =\n \\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\\\b_2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\b_m\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThis allows all the language and theory of ''[[vector space]]s'' (or more generally, ''[[module (mathematics)|module]]s'') to be brought to bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side is called their ''[[span (linear algebra)|span]]'', and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a ''[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]'' of [[linearly independent]] vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its ''[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]'') cannot be larger than ''m'' or ''n'', but it can be smaller. This is important because if we have ''m'' independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side, and otherwise not guaranteed.\n\n===Matrix equation===\nThe vector equation is equivalent to a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation of the form\n:<math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math>\nwhere ''A'' is an ''m''\u00d7''n'' matrix, '''x''' is a [[column vector]] with ''n'' entries, and '''b''' is a column vector with ''m'' entries.\n: <math>\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n\\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n\\mathbf{x}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_n\n\\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n\\mathbf{b}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_1 \\\\\nb_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nb_m\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nThe number of vectors in a basis for the span is now expressed as the ''[[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]'' of the matrix.\n\n==Solution set==\n[[Image:Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for the equations {{nowrap|''x'' &minus; ''y'' {{=}} &minus;1}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + ''y'' {{=}} 9}} is the single point (2,&nbsp;3).]]\nA '''solution''' of a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''}} such that each of the equations is satisfied. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible solutions is called the '''[[solution set]]'''.\n\nA linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:\n# The system has ''infinitely many solutions''.\n# The system has a single ''unique solution''.\n# The system has ''no solution''.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nFor a system involving two variables (''x'' and ''y''), each linear equation determines a [[line (mathematics)|line]] on the ''xy''-[[Cartesian coordinate system|plane]]. Because a solution to a linear system must satisfy all of the equations, the solution set is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of these lines, and is hence either a line, a single point, or the [[empty set]].\n\nFor three variables, each linear equation determines a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] in [[three-dimensional space]], and the solution set is the intersection of these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set. For example, as three parallel planes do not have a common point, the solution set of their equations is empty; the solution set of the equations of three planes intersecting at a point is single point; if three planes pass through two points, their equations have at least two common solutions; in fact the solution set is infinite and consists in all the line passing through these points.<ref name=\"Linear Matrices\">{{cite book |isbn= 978-0-486-66328-9|url= https://www.amazon.com/Matrices-Linear-Transformations-Edition-Mathematics/dp/0486663280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400776703&sr=8-1&keywords=cullen+matrices |title=Matrices and Linear Transformations |author=Charles G. Cullen |location= MA |publisher=Dover| year=1990 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nFor ''n'' variables, each linear equation determines a [[hyperplane]] in [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. The solution set is the intersection of these hyperplanes, and is a [[flat (geometry)|flat]], which may have any dimension lower than ''n''.\n\n===General behavior===\n[[File:Intersecting Planes 2.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for two equations in three variables is, in general, a line.]]\nIn general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns. Here, \"in general\" means that a different behavior may occur for specific values of the coefficients of the equations.\n* In general, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such a system is known as an [[underdetermined system]].\n* In general, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.\n* In general, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an [[overdetermined system]].\nIn the first case, the [[dimension]] of the solution set is, in general, equal to {{nowrap|''n'' &minus; ''m''}}, where ''n'' is the number of variables and ''m'' is the number of equations.\n\nThe following pictures illustrate this trichotomy in the case of two variables:\n:{| border=0 cellpadding=5\n|-\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:One Line.svg|120px]]\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:Two Lines.svg|120px]]\n| width=\"150\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:Three Lines.svg|120px]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| One equation\n|align=\"center\"| Two equations\n|align=\"center\"| Three equations\n|}\nThe first system has infinitely many solutions, namely all of the points on the blue line. The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines. The third system has no solutions, since the three lines share no common point.\n\nIt must be kept in mind that the pictures above show only the most common case (the general case). It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point).\n\nA system of linear equations behave differently from the general case if the equations are ''[[linear independence|linearly dependent]]'', or if it is ''[[#Consistency|inconsistent]]'' and has no more equations than unknowns.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Independence===\nThe equations of a linear system are '''independent''' if none of the equations can be derived algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases the size of the solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as [[linear independence]].\n\n[[Image:Three Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|''x'' &minus; 2''y'' {{=}} &minus;1}}, {{nowrap|3''x'' + 5''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and {{nowrap|4''x'' + 3''y'' {{=}} 7}} are linearly dependent.]]\nFor example, the equations\n:<math>3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;6x+4y=12</math>\nare not independent \u2014 they are the same equation when scaled by a factor of two, and they would produce identical graphs. This is an example of equivalence in a system of linear equations.\n\nFor a more complicated example, the equations\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n x &&\\; - \\;&& 2y &&\\; = \\;&& -1 & \\\\\n 3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; = \\;&& 8 & \\\\\n 4x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; = \\;&& 7 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nare not independent, because the third equation is the sum of the other two. Indeed, any one of these equations can be derived from the other two, and any one of the equations can be removed without affecting the solution set. The graphs of these equations are three lines that intersect at a single point.\n\n===Consistency===\n{{See also|Consistent and inconsistent equations}}\n[[Image:Parallel Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 6}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 12}} are inconsistent.]]\nA linear system is '''inconsistent''' if it has no solution, and otherwise it is said to be '''consistent'''. When the system is inconsistent, it is possible to derive a [[contradiction]] from the equations, that may always be rewritten as the statement {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}.\n\nFor example, the equations\n:<math>3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;3x+2y=12</math>\nare inconsistent. In fact, by subtracting the first equation from the second one and multiplying both sides of the result by 1/6, we get {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}. The graphs of these equations on the ''xy''-plane are a pair of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.\n\nIt is possible for three linear equations to be inconsistent, even though any two of them are consistent together. For example, the equations\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& y &&\\; = \\;&& 1 & \\\\\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& y &&\\; = \\;&& 1 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 2y &&\\; = \\;&& 3 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nare inconsistent. Adding the first two equations together gives {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 2}}, which can be subtracted from the third equation to yield {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}. Any two of these equations have a common solution. The same phenomenon can occur for any number of equations.\n\nIn general, inconsistencies occur if the left-hand sides of the equations in a system are linearly dependent, and the constant terms do not satisfy the dependence relation. A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.\n\nPutting it another way, according to the [[Rouch\u00e9\u2013Capelli theorem]], any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the [[augmented matrix]] is greater than the rank of the [[coefficient matrix]]. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has ''k'' free parameters where ''k'' is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions. The rank of a system of equations (i.e. the rank of the augmented matrix) can never be higher than [the number of variables] + 1, which means that a system with any number of equations can always be reduced to a system that has a number of [[independent equation]]s that is at most equal to [the number of variables] + 1.\n\n===Equivalence===\nTwo linear systems using the same set of variables are '''equivalent''' if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice versa. Two systems are equivalent if either both are inconsistent or each equation of each of them is a linear combination of the equations of the other one. It follows that two linear systems are equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set.\n\n==Solving a linear system==\nThere are several [[algorithm]]s for [[equation solving|solving]] a system of linear equations.\n\n===Describing the solution===\nWhen the solution set is finite, it is reduced to a single element. In this case, the unique solution is described by a sequence of equations whose left-hand sides are the names of the unknowns and right-hand sides are the corresponding values, for example <math>(x=3, \\;y=-2,\\; z=6)</math>. When an order on the unknowns has been fixed, for example the [[alphabetical order]] the solution may be described as a [[vector space|vector]] of values, like <math>(3, \\,-2,\\, 6)</math> for the previous example.\n\nTo describe a set with an infinite number of solutions, typically some of the variables are designated as '''free''' (or '''independent''', or as '''parameters'''), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining variables are '''dependent''' on the values of the free variables.\n\nFor example, consider the following system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; - \\;&& 2z &&\\; = \\;&& 5 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; + \\;&& 6z &&\\; = \\;&& 7 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nThe solution set to this system can be described by the following equations:\n:<math>x=-7z-1\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;y=3z+2\\text{.}</math>\nHere ''z'' is the free variable, while ''x'' and ''y'' are dependent on ''z''. Any point in the solution set can be obtained by first choosing a value for ''z'', and then computing the corresponding values for ''x'' and ''y''.\n\nEach free variable gives the solution space one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]], the number of which is equal to the [[dimension]] of the solution set. For example, the solution set for the above equation is a line, since a point in the solution set can be chosen by specifying the value of the parameter ''z''. An infinite solution of higher order may describe a plane, or higher-dimensional set.\n\nDifferent choices for the free variables may lead to different descriptions of the same solution set. For example, the solution to the above equations can alternatively be described as follows:\n:<math>y=-\\frac{3}{7}x + \\frac{11}{7}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{and}\\;\\;\\;\\;z=-\\frac{1}{7}x-\\frac{1}{7}\\text{.}</math>\nHere ''x'' is the free variable, and ''y'' and ''z'' are dependent.\n\n===Elimination of variables===\nThe simplest method for solving a system of linear equations is to repeatedly eliminate variables. This method can be described as follows:\n# In the first equation, solve for one of the variables in terms of the others.\n# Substitute this expression into the remaining equations. This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and one fewer unknown.\n# Repeat until the system is reduced to a single linear equation.\n# Solve this equation, and then back-substitute until the entire solution is found.\n\nFor example, consider the following system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; + \\;&& 3y &&\\; - \\;&& 2z &&\\; = \\;&& 5 & \\\\\n3x &&\\; + \\;&& 5y &&\\; + \\;&& 6z &&\\; = \\;&& 7 & \\\\\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& 4y &&\\; + \\;&& 3z &&\\; = \\;&& 8 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSolving the first equation for ''x'' gives {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 5 + 2''z'' &minus; 3''y''}}, and plugging this into the second and third equation yields\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{5}\n-4y &&\\; + \\;&& 12z &&\\; = \\;&& -8 & \\\\\n-2y &&\\; + \\;&& 7z &&\\; = \\;&& -2 &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSolving the first of these equations for ''y'' yields {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 2 + 3''z''}}, and plugging this into the second equation yields {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. We now have:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &&\\; = \\;&& 5 &&\\; + \\;&& 2z &&\\; - \\;&& 3y & \\\\\n y &&\\; = \\;&& 2 &&\\; + \\;&& 3z && && & \\\\\n z &&\\; = \\;&& 2 && && && && &\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nSubstituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} into the second equation gives {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and substituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} and {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}} into the first equation yields {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &minus;15}}. Therefore, the solution set is the single point {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (&minus;15, 8, 2)}}.\n\n===Row reduction===\n{{main|Gaussian elimination}}\nIn '''row reduction''' (also known as '''Gaussian elimination'''), the linear system is represented as an [[augmented matrix]]:\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]\\text{.}\n</math>\nThis matrix is then modified using [[elementary row operations]] until it reaches [[reduced row echelon form]]. There are three types of elementary row operations:\n:'''Type 1''': Swap the positions of two rows.\n:'''Type 2''': Multiply a row by a nonzero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].\n:'''Type 3''': Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.\nBecause these operations are reversible, the augmented matrix produced always represents a linear system that is equivalent to the original.\n\nThere are several specific algorithms to row-reduce an augmented matrix, the simplest of which are [[Gaussian elimination]] and [[Gauss-Jordan elimination]]. The following computation shows Gauss-Jordan elimination applied to the matrix above:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]&\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 3 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 7 & -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 7 & -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\\\\n&\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 0 & 0 & -15 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align}</math>\nThe last matrix is in reduced row echelon form, and represents the system {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &minus;15}}, {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. A comparison with the example in the previous section on the algebraic elimination of variables shows that these two methods are in fact the same; the difference lies in how the computations are written down.\n\n===Cramer's rule===\n{{main|Cramer's rule}}\n'''Cramer's rule''' is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations, with each variable given by a quotient of two [[determinant]]s. For example, the solution to the system\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n x &\\; + &\\; 3y &\\; - &\\; 2z &\\; = &\\; 5 \\\\\n3x &\\; + &\\; 5y &\\; + &\\; 6z &\\; = &\\; 7 \\\\\n2x &\\; + &\\; 4y &\\; + &\\; 3z &\\; = &\\; 8 \n\\end{alignat}</math>\nis given by\n:<math>\nx=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}5&3&-2\\\\7&5&6\\\\8&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n,\\;\\;\\;\\;y=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&5&-2\\\\3&7&6\\\\2&8&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n,\\;\\;\\;\\;z=\\frac\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&5\\\\3&5&7\\\\2&4&8\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}\n{\\,\\left| \\begin{matrix}1&3&-2\\\\3&5&6\\\\2&4&3\\end{matrix} \\right|\\,}.\n</math>\nFor each variable, the denominator is the determinant of the [[matrix of coefficients]], while the numerator is the determinant of a matrix in which one column has been replaced by the vector of constant terms.\n\nThough Cramer's rule is important theoretically, it has little practical value for large matrices, since the computation of large determinants is somewhat cumbersome. (Indeed, large determinants are most easily computed using row reduction.)\nFurther, Cramer's rule has very poor numerical properties, making it unsuitable for solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Matrix solution===\n\nIf the equation system is expressed in the matrix form <math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math>, the entire solution set can also be expressed in matrix form. If the matrix ''A'' is square (has ''m'' rows and ''n''=''m'' columns) and has full rank (all ''m'' rows are independent), then the system has a unique solution given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A^{-1}</math> is the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of ''A''. More generally, regardless of whether ''m''=''n'' or not and regardless of the rank of ''A'', all solutions (if any exist) are given using the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]] of ''A'', denoted <math>A^+</math>, as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}=A^+ \\mathbf{b} + (I-A^+ A)\\mathbf{w}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> is a vector of free parameters that ranges over all possible ''n''\u00d71 vectors. A necessary and sufficient condition for any solution(s) to exist is that the potential solution obtained using <math>\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}</math> satisfy <math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math> &mdash; that is, that <math>AA^+ \\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}.</math> If this condition does not hold, the equation system is inconsistent and has no solution. If the condition holds, the system is consistent and at least one solution exists. For example, in the above-mentioned case in which ''A'' is square and of full rank, <math>A^+</math> simply equals <math>A^{-1}</math> and the general solution equation simplifies to <math>\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} + (I - A^{-1}A)\\mathbf{w} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} + (I-I)\\mathbf{w} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}</math> as previously stated, where <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> has completely dropped out of the solution, leaving only a single solution.  In other cases, though, <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> remains and hence an infinitude of potential values of the free parameter vector <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> give an infinitude of solutions of the equation.\n\n===Other methods===\nWhile systems of three or four equations can be readily solved by hand (see [[Cracovian]]), computers are often used for larger systems. The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as [[Pivot element|''pivoting'']]. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the [[LU decomposition]] of the matrix ''A''. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix ''A'' but different vectors '''b'''.\n\nIf the matrix ''A'' has some special structure, this can be exploited to obtain faster or more accurate algorithms. For instance, systems with a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix can be solved twice as fast with the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. [[Levinson recursion]] is a fast method for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrices]]. Special methods exist also for matrices with many zero elements (so-called [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]), which appear often in applications.\n\nA completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have to be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of [[iterative method]]s.\n\nThere is also a [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]].<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\">[https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171 Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, by Harrow et al.].</ref>\n\n==Homogeneous systems==\n{{see also|Homogeneous differential equation}}\nA system of linear equations is '''homogeneous''' if all of the constant terms are zero:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\na_{11} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{12} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{1n} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0 \\\\\na_{21} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{22} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{2n} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0 \\\\\n\\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&              && \\vdots\\;\\;\\; &&     &&& \\,\\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} x_1 &&\\; + \\;&& a_{m2} x_2 &&\\; + \\cdots + \\;&& a_{mn} x_n &&\\; = \\;&&& 0. \\\\\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nA homogeneous system is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form\n:<math>A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0}</math>\nwhere ''A'' is an {{nowrap|''m'' &times; ''n''}} matrix, '''x''' is a column vector with ''n'' entries, and '''0''' is the [[zero vector]] with ''m'' entries.\n\n===Homogeneous solution set===\nEvery homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the ''zero'' (or ''trivial'') solution, which is obtained by assigning the value of zero to each of the variables. If the system has a [[non-singular matrix]] ({{math|det(''A'') \u2260 0}}) then it is also the only solution.  If the system has a singular matrix then there is a solution set with an infinite number of solutions.  This solution set has the following additional properties:\n# If '''u''' and '''v''' are two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] representing solutions to a homogeneous system, then the vector sum {{nowrap|'''u''' + '''v'''}} is also a solution to the system.\n# If '''u''' is a vector representing a solution to a homogeneous system, and ''r'' is any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], then ''r'''''u''' is also a solution to the system.\nThese are exactly the properties required for the solution set to be a [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. In particular, the solution set to a homogeneous system is the same as the [[Kernel (matrix)|null space]] of the corresponding matrix ''A''.\nNumerical solutions to a homogeneous system can be found with a [[Singular value decomposition#Solving homogeneous linear equations|singular value decomposition]].\n\n===Relation to nonhomogeneous systems===\nThere is a close relationship between the solutions to a linear system and the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous system:\n:<math>A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0}\\text{.}</math>\nSpecifically, if '''p''' is any specific solution to the linear system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}}, then the entire solution set can be described as\n:<math>\\left\\{ \\textbf{p}+\\textbf{v} : \\textbf{v}\\text{ is any solution to }A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0} \\right\\}.</math>\nGeometrically, this says that the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''0'''}}. Specifically, the [[flat (geometry)|flat]] for the first system can be obtained by translating the [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] for the homogeneous system by the vector '''p'''.\n\nThis reasoning only applies if the system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} has at least one solution. This occurs if and only if the vector '''b''' lies in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the [[linear transformation]] ''A''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arrangement of hyperplanes]]\n* [[Iterative refinement]]\n* [[Coates graph]]\n* [[LAPACK]] (the free standard package to solve linear equations numerically; available in [[Fortran]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]])\n* [[Linear equation over a ring]]\n* [[Linear least squares (mathematics)|Linear least squares]]\n* [[Matrix decomposition]]\n* [[Matrix splitting]]\n* [[NAG Numerical Library]] (NAG Library versions of LAPACK solvers) \n* [[Simultaneous equations]]\n* [[Moore\u2013Penrose pseudoinverse]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{ citation | last1 = Anton | first1 = Howard | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-471-84819-0 | title = Elementary Linear Algebra | edition = 5th | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | location = New York }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Beauregard | first1 = Raymond A. | last2 = Fraleigh | first2 = John B. | title = A First Course In Linear Algebra: with Optional Introduction to Groups, Rings, and Fields | location = Boston | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Company]] | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-395-14017-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/firstcourseinlin0000beau }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Burden | first1 = Richard L. | last2 = Faires | first2 = J.

Hamilton, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], was an instrumental promoter of the [[U.S. Constitution]], founder of the nation's financial system, and its first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. \n\nThe book, which was met with mostly positive acclaim, went on to win the inaugural [[George Washington Book Prize]] for early American history and was a nominee for the 2005 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in biography. In 2015, the book was [[Hamilton (musical)|adapted to the stage]] by playwright [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] where it went on to win numerous accolades including 11 [[Tony Award]]s. \n\n==Background==\nBefore working on ''Alexander Hamilton'', Chernow had previously written multiple books in the topics of business and finance. In 1990, he published ''[[The House of Morgan]]'', which covered the life of financier [[J.P. Morgan]] and went on to win the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Book Awards 1990 |url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1990/ |website=National Book Foundation |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref> in 1998, he wrote a biography about [[John D.

In 2015, the book was [[Hamilton (musical)|adapted to the stage]] by playwright [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] where it went on to win numerous accolades including 11 [[Tony Award]]s. \n\n==Background==\nBefore working on ''Alexander Hamilton'', Chernow had previously written multiple books in the topics of business and finance. In 1990, he published ''[[The House of Morgan]]'', which covered the life of financier [[J.P. Morgan]] and went on to win the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Book Awards 1990 |url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1990/ |website=National Book Foundation |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref> in 1998, he wrote a biography about [[John D.

The contents cover drafts of songs and poems, observations, ideas, [[epitaph]]s, etc.\n\n==Commonplace Books==\n[[Robert Burns]]'s two [[Commonplace books]], 1783 to 1785 and then a second 1787 to 1790, are personal compilations of early drafts of songs, prose and some poetry as well as observations on people, places and ideas. Copies of poetry, excerpts from books, quotations, moral, religious and philosophical, contemplative, etc. are included.<ref name=\"MB\"/> Such books are unique to the author's particular interests and often include passages found in other texts accompanied by the compiler's comments.\n\nThe term \"Commonplace\" derives from the [[Latin]] expression ''locus communis'' which translates as \"a general or common topic\". Generally the individual concerned collects material which have a common theme. Although they are private collections of information, they are not [[Diary|diaries]]. Keeping such a book was usually the pastime of the aristocracy with their ample leisure time, education and refinement.<ref name=\"MB\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

Page 37.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Burns's use of a cypher in ''Now Westlin Winds''.]]\nThe first entry is April 1783, a date at which the practically unknown 24 year old Burns was living at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlie Farm]] near [[Tarbolton]], [[South Ayrshire]].<ref name=\"Mu\"/> The last, incomplete entry, is for October 1785 by which time Burns was at Mossgiel Farm near [[Mauchline]]. The contents are of considerable value to those researching Robert Burns's life, personality, literary methodology, works and relationships. The abrupt abandonment is likely to relate to his efforts at composing new poems and revising existing works with thoughts of publication in mind.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

Mackay speculated that this may be because he was aware that [[Isabella Burns]], his youngest sister, was in the habit of secretly reading his compositions.<ref name=\"JMB\"/> The frequent quotations throughout from philosophers, poets and writers illustrate the unusual breadth and width of his reading as a farmer at the age of 24.\n\n===The Abridged Glenridell Manuscript version===\n[[File:Scott Douglas's 'ignorant critic' comment, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785. Page13.jpg|thumb|250px|''Ignorant critic comment'' on ''W.R.'']]\nBurns prepared an abridged version of his ''First Commonplace Book of 1783-1785'' for the second volume of the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]].

A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing Ltd|isbn=|page=469}}</ref> As stated, the [[folio]] has 42 pages and about 1250 lines of manuscript whilst the [[quarto]] abridgement covers pages 31 to 42, twelve pages with 232 lines of manuscript. Only two pieces of poetry are included, being 22 lines beginning ''Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace'' and 20 lines of experimental [[blank verse]] beginning ''All devil as I am, a damned wretch''.<ref name=\"ED\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=ix}}</ref>\n\nBurns prefaced the abridgement: ''On rummaging over some old papers, I lighted on a M.S.S. of my early years, in which I had determined to write myself out; as I was placed by Fortune among a class of men to whom my ideas would have been nonsense. I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''. At the end of the abridgement he wrote ''This is all that, & perhaps more than, is worth quoting, in my M.S.S.''<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\n===Sequence of works===\nThe pages are numbered from 2 to 42 in Burns's own hand, with pages 1, 43 hard to read or absent and page 44 not apparently numbered. Page 1 carries the descriptive title ''Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry, etc. by Robt Burness; ...'' Page 2 was left blank by Burns, but was written on by John Syme. Page 44 was and remains entirely blank.<ref name=\"Mu\"/>\n\n===Comments, notes, additions and alterations===\n[[File:John Syme's editing comments, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785. Page 2.jpg|thumb|250px|John Syme's comments from page 2.]]\nThroughout the manuscripts are to be found comments and / or alterations, some by Robert Burns himself, the others by John Syme, James Currie, W. Scott Douglas and a 'W.R.'<ref name=\"ED\"/> These annotations are identifiable from their handwriting, appearance of the ink used, content, etc.\n\nJohn Syme, a good friend of Burns, visited James Currie at Liverpool with [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]] on 30 August 1797, as noted on page 1. ''W.R.'' commented much earlier, probably around 1786. James Currie had possession of the manuscript from January 1797.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William Scott Douglas (1878) apparently contributed at least one annotation, the ''..ignorant critic'' comment on page 13.\n\nBurns's comment on his lines of [[blank verse]] ''Intended for a tragedy'' on page 6 have been taken to infer that he had thoughts of writing a play.<ref name=\"ig\">{{Cite book|last=Grimble|first=Ian|year=1995|title=Robert Burns|publisher=Lomond Books|isbn=9781851527342|page=37}}</ref>\n\n===Who was W.R.?===\nThe 1786 annotator ''W.R.'' has only recently been tentatively identified. A William Ronald had been suggested by William Scott Douglas.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William was gauds boy to Burns at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]], helping him with the ploughing by encouraging and guiding the horses whilst carrying a plough staff to clean the ploughshare when it clogged with earth. He later became a farmer at [[Barkip|Mauleside]], a small estate near [[Beith]]. Little is known of his life and therefore his qualifications as a critic of Burns's work are open to question. ''W.R.'' appears to have been asked by Burns to help with the selection of material for inclusion in the first [[Kilmarnock]] edition of his [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect]].\n\nA more convincing identification is that of William Reid of Brash and Reid, booksellers, Glasgow. William had served his apprenticeship with Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson, also of Glasgow. In 1786 they were the largest printers, publishers and printers in city. John Reid, his son, recalled his father recounting the following:-\n\n\"''On one occasion, precise date now unknown, a stranger of most remarkable aspect, of rustic appearance and with a shepherd\u2019s plaid on his shoulders, presented himself to Mr. Reid on Dunlop and Wilson\u2019s premises\u2014with an introduction to him, it is believed, from his friend Gavin Turnbull. This stranger\u2019s errand was two-fold\u2014first to obtain publication, or more extensive publication, for a volume of poems, which he had in manuscript, or in printed sheets\u2014uncertain which\u2014in his hand; and second, an introduction through Mr. Reid or his employers to some of the wealthiest merchants in Glasgow, with a view to obtain a settlement for himself in the West Indies. He looked and spoke in the deepest distress\u2014in distress approaching to despair, and was occasionally moved even to tears.''\n\n''The poems he produced at the same time were of so great beauty, that, between sympathy and admiration, Mr. Reid was at a loss what to do. Finally, after discussing all the circumstances of the case and carefully scrutinising the poems, Mr. Reid, though a much younger man, affectionately struck his visitor on the shoulder and said, \u201cYour country, Sir, cannot afford to send you to the West Indies; you must go to Edinburgh and not to Jamaica.\u201d The stranger, we need hardly say, was Robert Burns. It was not in Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson's line to publish volumes, much less small volumes of poetry; but Mr. Reid, though still a youth, gave the unknown a letter of introduction to Mr. Creech, with whom he was personally acquainted, and the interview for the present terminated.''\"<ref>[https://burnsc21.glasgow.ac.uk/guest-blog-by-professor-patrick-scott-the-mysterious-wr-once-more-a-mid-victorian-reminiscence/?fbclid=IwAR2g0V3FIx_LVKSTpIlK_iKFpF9tGXaPXeeJN0NQRcUK84Ua9-o5b3RQoB4 Guest Blog by Professor Patrick Scott \u2013 The mysterious \u2018WR\u2019 once more: a mid-Victorian reminiscence.]</ref>\n\n===Details of the size, appearance, etc.===\nThe book is formed from eleven folio sheets on [[Laid paper|laid or chain and line]] paper that was folded to create a volume of size twelve and a half by seven and three-quarters inches, with twenty-two leaves and fourty-four pages.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> They were originally ''broached with a course thread'' and were later bound in Morocco.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> By 1888 it was enclosed in a lockable rosewood box.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nBurns's writing was perfectly legible with relatively few alterations or corrections.

In January 1797 both Commonplace books were sent to [[James Currie (physician)|Dr James Currie]] in [[Liverpool]] who used some of this material in his ''The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author'' which was he published in four volumes in 1800. Both of the Commonplace books remained with Dr Currie as did the other material, such as the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> Shortly before his death in 1805 it narrowly escaped being burnt.<ref name=\"viii\">Ewing, p.viii</ref> William Wallace Currie, James's son, inherited the book and when he died in 1840 it again narrowly escaped destruction as his will instructed his wife to ''destroy or keep'' the manuscripts that were in his possession.<ref name=\"viii\"/> They passed to Sarah France Currie, James's daughter-in-law. Messrs. Puttick and Simpson of London on 2 May 1861 offered the book for auction as lot no. 203, but the catalogue did not indicate ownership, although the evidence suggests that the Currie Estate had instructed the sale.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nA London bookseller purchased the lot, paying only \u00a336, transferring it to Basil Montagu Pickering, another dealer who catalogued it but found no buyer. In 1868 another attempt realised several orders and the book was sent to John Adam of [[Greenock]]. John Duff inherited it in 1879 and on his death it was sold by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge of London. As lot no. 939 it was purchased by booksellers, Kerr & Richardson, for \u00a3101<ref name=\"viii\"/> and sold to Thomas Glen Arthur of Carrick House in [[Ayr]] and Glasgow. In 1891 it was sold to William Law through Kerr & Richardson, despite being included in Arthur's pivately-printed catalogue.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nWilliam Law lived at Honresfield House in Lancashire and after his death in 1901 it passed to Alfred Law, his brother. In 1913, 116 years after it was loaned to Dr James Curry, it passed to his nephew, [[Alfred Law|Sir Alfred Joseph Law]], who still held it in 1938 when a full facsimile was published by Gowans and Gray of [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> The book is now owned by a private collector.\n\nIn 1896 William Law lent the book to the organisers of ''The Burns Exhibition'' held at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in Glasgow from 15 July to 31 October 1896. It is recorded and facsimiles of a few pages were included in the ''Memorial Catalogue of the Burns Exhibition'' published by William Hodge & Company in 1898.\n\nThe authors who had direct access to the original manuscript were [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] in 1800, R.H.Cromek in 1808, C.D.Lamont in 1872 and finally W. Scott Douglas in 1878.<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=x}}</ref>\n\n==The 1872 Adam-Lamont reproduction and the 1938 facsimile==\n[[File:Burns's self criticism, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

He was living in Edinburgh when the book was started and at [[Ellisland Farm]] when the last entry was made. The volume is sometimes known as the ''Edinburgh Journal'' and after the poet's death passed into the hands of [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] and was used in his 1800 publication of Burns's works.

The contents cover drafts of songs and poems, observations, ideas, [[epitaph]]s, etc.\n\n==Commonplace Books==\n[[Robert Burns]]'s two [[Commonplace books]], 1783 to 1785 and then a second 1787 to 1790, are personal compilations of early drafts of songs, prose and some poetry as well as observations on people, places and ideas. Copies of poetry, excerpts from books, quotations, moral, religious and philosophical, contemplative, etc. are included.<ref name=\"MB\"/> Such books are unique to the author's particular interests and often include passages found in other texts accompanied by the compiler's comments.\n\nThe term \"Commonplace\" derives from the [[Latin]] expression ''locus communis'' which translates as \"a general or common topic\". Generally the individual concerned collects material which have a common theme. Although they are private collections of information, they are not [[Diary|diaries]]. Keeping such a book was usually the pastime of the aristocracy with their ample leisure time, education and refinement.<ref name=\"MB\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

The contents are of considerable value to those researching Robert Burns's life, personality, literary methodology, works and relationships.

Mackay speculated that this may be because he was aware that [[Isabella Burns]], his youngest sister, was in the habit of secretly reading his compositions.<ref name=\"JMB\"/> The frequent quotations throughout from philosophers, poets and writers illustrate the unusual breadth and width of his reading as a farmer at the age of 24.\n\n===The Abridged Glenridell Manuscript version===\n[[File:Scott Douglas's 'ignorant critic' comment, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

Only two pieces of poetry are included, being 22 lines beginning ''Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace'' and 20 lines of experimental [[blank verse]] beginning ''All devil as I am, a damned wretch''.<ref name=\"ED\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=ix}}</ref>\n\nBurns prefaced the abridgement: ''On rummaging over some old papers, I lighted on a M.S.S. of my early years, in which I had determined to write myself out; as I was placed by Fortune among a class of men to whom my ideas would have been nonsense. I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''. At the end of the abridgement he wrote ''This is all that, & perhaps more than, is worth quoting, in my M.S.S.''<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\n===Sequence of works===\nThe pages are numbered from 2 to 42 in Burns's own hand, with pages 1, 43 hard to read or absent and page 44 not apparently numbered. Page 1 carries the descriptive title ''Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry, etc. by Robt Burness; ...'' Page 2 was left blank by Burns, but was written on by John Syme. Page 44 was and remains entirely blank.<ref name=\"Mu\"/>\n\n===Comments, notes, additions and alterations===\n[[File:John Syme's editing comments, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785. Page 2.jpg|thumb|250px|John Syme's comments from page 2.]]\nThroughout the manuscripts are to be found comments and / or alterations, some by Robert Burns himself, the others by John Syme, James Currie, W. Scott Douglas and a 'W.R.'<ref name=\"ED\"/> These annotations are identifiable from their handwriting, appearance of the ink used, content, etc.\n\nJohn Syme, a good friend of Burns, visited James Currie at Liverpool with [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]] on 30 August 1797, as noted on page 1. ''W.R.'' commented much earlier, probably around 1786. James Currie had possession of the manuscript from January 1797.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William Scott Douglas (1878) apparently contributed at least one annotation, the ''..ignorant critic'' comment on page 13.\n\nBurns's comment on his lines of [[blank verse]] ''Intended for a tragedy'' on page 6 have been taken to infer that he had thoughts of writing a play.<ref name=\"ig\">{{Cite book|last=Grimble|first=Ian|year=1995|title=Robert Burns|publisher=Lomond Books|isbn=9781851527342|page=37}}</ref>\n\n===Who was W.R.?===\nThe 1786 annotator ''W.R.'' has only recently been tentatively identified. A William Ronald had been suggested by William Scott Douglas.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William was gauds boy to Burns at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]], helping him with the ploughing by encouraging and guiding the horses whilst carrying a plough staff to clean the ploughshare when it clogged with earth. He later became a farmer at [[Barkip|Mauleside]], a small estate near [[Beith]]. Little is known of his life and therefore his qualifications as a critic of Burns's work are open to question. ''W.R.'' appears to have been asked by Burns to help with the selection of material for inclusion in the first [[Kilmarnock]] edition of his [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect]].\n\nA more convincing identification is that of William Reid of Brash and Reid, booksellers, Glasgow. William had served his apprenticeship with Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson, also of Glasgow. In 1786 they were the largest printers, publishers and printers in city. John Reid, his son, recalled his father recounting the following:-\n\n\"''On one occasion, precise date now unknown, a stranger of most remarkable aspect, of rustic appearance and with a shepherd\u2019s plaid on his shoulders, presented himself to Mr. Reid on Dunlop and Wilson\u2019s premises\u2014with an introduction to him, it is believed, from his friend Gavin Turnbull. This stranger\u2019s errand was two-fold\u2014first to obtain publication, or more extensive publication, for a volume of poems, which he had in manuscript, or in printed sheets\u2014uncertain which\u2014in his hand; and second, an introduction through Mr. Reid or his employers to some of the wealthiest merchants in Glasgow, with a view to obtain a settlement for himself in the West Indies. He looked and spoke in the deepest distress\u2014in distress approaching to despair, and was occasionally moved even to tears.''\n\n''The poems he produced at the same time were of so great beauty, that, between sympathy and admiration, Mr. Reid was at a loss what to do. Finally, after discussing all the circumstances of the case and carefully scrutinising the poems, Mr. Reid, though a much younger man, affectionately struck his visitor on the shoulder and said, \u201cYour country, Sir, cannot afford to send you to the West Indies; you must go to Edinburgh and not to Jamaica.\u201d The stranger, we need hardly say, was Robert Burns. It was not in Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson's line to publish volumes, much less small volumes of poetry; but Mr. Reid, though still a youth, gave the unknown a letter of introduction to Mr. Creech, with whom he was personally acquainted, and the interview for the present terminated.''\"<ref>[https://burnsc21.glasgow.ac.uk/guest-blog-by-professor-patrick-scott-the-mysterious-wr-once-more-a-mid-victorian-reminiscence/?fbclid=IwAR2g0V3FIx_LVKSTpIlK_iKFpF9tGXaPXeeJN0NQRcUK84Ua9-o5b3RQoB4 Guest Blog by Professor Patrick Scott \u2013 The mysterious \u2018WR\u2019 once more: a mid-Victorian reminiscence.]</ref>\n\n===Details of the size, appearance, etc.===\nThe book is formed from eleven folio sheets on [[Laid paper|laid or chain and line]] paper that was folded to create a volume of size twelve and a half by seven and three-quarters inches, with twenty-two leaves and fourty-four pages.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> They were originally ''broached with a course thread'' and were later bound in Morocco.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> By 1888 it was enclosed in a lockable rosewood box.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nBurns's writing was perfectly legible with relatively few alterations or corrections.

In January 1797 both Commonplace books were sent to [[James Currie (physician)|Dr James Currie]] in [[Liverpool]] who used some of this material in his ''The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author'' which was he published in four volumes in 1800. Both of the Commonplace books remained with Dr Currie as did the other material, such as the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> Shortly before his death in 1805 it narrowly escaped being burnt.<ref name=\"viii\">Ewing, p.viii</ref> William Wallace Currie, James's son, inherited the book and when he died in 1840 it again narrowly escaped destruction as his will instructed his wife to ''destroy or keep'' the manuscripts that were in his possession.<ref name=\"viii\"/> They passed to Sarah France Currie, James's daughter-in-law. Messrs. Puttick and Simpson of London on 2 May 1861 offered the book for auction as lot no. 203, but the catalogue did not indicate ownership, although the evidence suggests that the Currie Estate had instructed the sale.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nA London bookseller purchased the lot, paying only \u00a336, transferring it to Basil Montagu Pickering, another dealer who catalogued it but found no buyer. In 1868 another attempt realised several orders and the book was sent to John Adam of [[Greenock]]. John Duff inherited it in 1879 and on his death it was sold by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge of London. As lot no. 939 it was purchased by booksellers, Kerr & Richardson, for \u00a3101<ref name=\"viii\"/> and sold to Thomas Glen Arthur of Carrick House in [[Ayr]] and Glasgow. In 1891 it was sold to William Law through Kerr & Richardson, despite being included in Arthur's pivately-printed catalogue.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nWilliam Law lived at Honresfield House in Lancashire and after his death in 1901 it passed to Alfred Law, his brother. In 1913, 116 years after it was loaned to Dr James Curry, it passed to his nephew, [[Alfred Law|Sir Alfred Joseph Law]], who still held it in 1938 when a full facsimile was published by Gowans and Gray of [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> The book is now owned by a private collector.\n\nIn 1896 William Law lent the book to the organisers of ''The Burns Exhibition'' held at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in Glasgow from 15 July to 31 October 1896. It is recorded and facsimiles of a few pages were included in the ''Memorial Catalogue of the Burns Exhibition'' published by William Hodge & Company in 1898.\n\nThe authors who had direct access to the original manuscript were [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] in 1800, R.H.Cromek in 1808, C.D.Lamont in 1872 and finally W. Scott Douglas in 1878.<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=x}}</ref>\n\n==The 1872 Adam-Lamont reproduction and the 1938 facsimile==\n[[File:Burns's self criticism, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

He was living in Edinburgh when the book was started and at [[Ellisland Farm]] when the last entry was made. The volume is sometimes known as the ''Edinburgh Journal'' and after the poet's death passed into the hands of [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] and was used in his 1800 publication of Burns's works. It is now held by the [[Robert Burns Birthplace Museum]] at [[Alloway]].<ref name=\"ml\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=9780709091943|page=92}}</ref>\n\n{{commons category|Robert Burns}}\n{{Commons category|Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition)]]\n* [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Second Edinburgh Edition)]]\n* [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (London Edition)]]\n* [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]]\n* [[Robert Burns World Federation]]\n* [[Burns Clubs]]\n{{portal|Poetry|Scotland}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/groups/554450588374356/ Researching the Life and Times of Robert Burns Club] Researcher's site.\n{{Robert Burns}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Robert Burns]]\n[[Category:British poetry collections]]\n[[Category:Scottish folk-song collectors]]\n[[Category:Scottish literature]]\n[[Category:Scottish songwriters]]\n", "name_user": "Rosser1954", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe comments made by W.R.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns%27s_Commonplace_Book_1783-1785"}

After each battle round the losing artist then pitched to the other three coaches on why they should join their team. It was then up to the coaches (who have a limited amount of time) to press their red button to steal the artist.

After each battle round the losing artist then pitched to the other three coaches on why they should join their team. It was then up to the coaches (who have a limited amount of time) to press their red button to steal the artist. They could press their button as many times as they liked but were only allowed to steal one artist.

The law meant women would not be jailed if they were unable to prove rape, and allows rape to be proved on grounds other than witnesses, such as forensics and DNA evidence.<ref name=\"ML252007: 1308\"/>\n\nThe Bill remains controversial amongst many liberals and moderates in Pakistan who argue it does not go far enough as stoning to death is still theoretically on a punishment, though not implemented by the courts, the liberals argue it should be removed entirely. However, some religious parties have called the bill Un-Islamic and by extension unconstitutional, however the Supreme Court of Pakistan has not overturned the Bill on the grounds that it violates the Islamic provisions in Pakistan's constitution, hence stands to the present day. Pakistan's province, Punjab passed another women's bill which instituted further reforms this is pending before the courts on grounds of unconstitutionality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1243466|title=Women\u2019s protection act challenged in Federal Shariat Court|first=Nasir|last=Iqbal|date=4 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nThe Hudood Ordinances, enacted by military ruler [[Zia ul-Haq]] in 1979, criminalise adultery and non-marital consensual sex.

Worse, in actual practice, the vast majority of accused women were found guilty by the trial court only to be acquitted on appeal to the Federal Shariat Court. By then they had spent many years in jail, were ostracized by their families, and had become social outcasts.<ref name=\"ML252007: 1296\">[[#ML252007|Lau, \"Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances\", 2007]]: p.1296</ref></blockquote> \n\nAttention to the Ordinance and suggestions for revising it were given by a number of government appointed commissions, a televised several weeks-long-televised debate on the subject of \"No debate on Hudood Allah (Allah's laws as prescribed in Quran and Sunnah)-is the Hudood Ordinance (Man's\ninterpretation of Allah's law) Islamic?\" on Geo television channel, and a 2005 [[University of Karachi]] Dept of Public Administration workshop.<ref name=UKdawn>{{cite news|title=KARACHI: KU workshop urges review of Hudood laws|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/157864/karachi-ku-workshop-urges-review-of-hudood-laws|accessdate=19 November 2014|publisher=dawn.com|date=23 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe new Women's Protection Bill brings rape under the [[Pakistan Penal Code]], which is based on civil law, not [[Sharia]] (Islamic law). The Bill removes the right of police to detain people suspected of having sex outside of marriage, instead requiring a formal accusation in court.
