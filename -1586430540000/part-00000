Additional efficiency can be gained from [[regenerative braking]], which allows [[kinetic energy]] to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line. Newer electric locomotives use AC motor-inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance. Power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives are ideal for [[commuter rail]] service with frequent stops. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can also come from clean or [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]], including [[geothermal power]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]], [[nuclear power]], [[solar power]] and [[wind turbine]]s.<ref name=\"Hay1982\">{{cite book|last=Hay|first=William W|title=Railroad engineering|volume=1|year=1982|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-36400-9|page=137|chapter=The economics of electrification}}</ref> Electric locomotives usually cost 20% less than diesel locomotives, their maintenance costs are 25-35% lower, and cost up to 50% less to run. <ref>https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/electrification-of-u.s.-railways-pie-in-the-sky-or-realistic-goal</ref>\n\nThe chief disadvantage of electrification is the high cost for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car & freight truck emissions, in order to limit the amount of carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources.<ref>{{cite web |title=EPA, Transportation and Air Quality  |url=https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/locomotives.htm}}</ref> Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling to make the necessary investments for electrification. In Europe and elsewhere, railway networks are considered part of the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Direct current ===\n[[File:1879 Siemens & Halske Wernerwerk Electric locomotive.jpg|thumb|1879 Siemens & Halske experimental train]][[File:B&O 1895 loco.png|thumb|Electric locomotive of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]], US 1895: The steam locomotive was not detached for passage through the tunnel.

The locomotive was driven by a 2.2&nbsp;kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13&nbsp;km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-metre-long (984&nbsp;feet) circular track. The electricity (150&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.\n\nThe world's first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see [[Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway]] and [[Berlin Stra\u00dfenbahn]]). [[Volk's Electric Railway]] opened in 1883 in Brighton. Also in 1883, [[M\u00f6dling and Hinterbr\u00fchl Tram]] opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line.

Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically-worked [[rapid transit|underground]] line was the [[City and South London Railway]], prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting the use of steam power.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Badsey-Ellis\n | first =Antony\n | title =London's Lost Tube Schemes\n | publisher = Capital Transport\n | year = 2005\n | location = Harrow\n | page = 36\n | isbn = 978-1-85414-293-1 \n}}</ref> It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by [[Mather and Platt]]. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of [[multiple-unit train control]] in 1897. Surface and elevated [[rapid transit]] systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.\n\nThe first use of electrification on an American main line was on a four-mile stretch of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B&O to the new line to New York through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore's downtown. Parallel tracks on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had shown that coal smoke from [[steam locomotive]]s would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three [[UIC classification#Bo+Bo|Bo+Bo]] units were initially used, at the south end of the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels.<ref>''B&O Power'', Sagle, Lawrence, Alvin Stauffer</ref> Railroad entrances to [[New York City]] required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the [[Harlem River]] after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the [[New York Central Railroad]]. In the 1930s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].\n\nThe [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (the Milwaukee Road), the last transcontinental line to be built, electrified its lines across the [[Rocky Mountains]] and to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]], electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic and the use of electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=241}} Diesel shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the [[Deseret Power Railroad]]), by 2000 electrification was confined to the [[Northeast Corridor]] and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesel. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread. 1,500&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz is used by high-speed trains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Alternating current===\n\nThe first practical [[Alternating current|AC]] electric locomotive was designed by [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown|Charles Brown]], then working for [[Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon|Oerlikon]], Z\u00fcrich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission, using [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase AC]], between a [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric plant]] at [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] West, a distance of 280&nbsp;km. Using experience he had gained while working for [[Heilmann locomotive|Jean Heilmann]] on steam-electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that [[AC motor#Three-phase AC synchronous motors|three-phase motors]] had a higher power-to-weight ratio than [[Direct current|DC]] motors and, because of the absence of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], were simpler to manufacture and maintain.{{efn-lr|Heilmann evaluated both AC and DC electric transmission for his locomotives, but eventually settled on a design based on [[Thomas Edison]]'s DC system.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=39\u201341}}}}  However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor [[bogie]]s: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=129}}\n\nIn 1894, Hungarian engineer [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]] developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. \nKand\u00f3's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]] (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.<ref>{{cite book\n  |author=Andrew L.

After WW2, 3 kV&nbsp;DC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=L'esperimento a 10 Kv 45 Hz (1928\u20131944)\n  |url=http://www.ilmondodeitreni.it/trifase_parte_3.htm\n  |website=Il Mondo dei Treni\n}}</ref>\n\nA later development of Kand\u00f3, working with both the [[Ganz]] works and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Societa Italiana Westinghouse]], was an [[Rotary phase converter|electro-mechanical converter]], allowing the use of three-phase motors from single-phase AC, eliminating the need for two overhead wires.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=117}} In 1923, the first phase-converter locomotive in Hungary was constructed on the basis of Kand\u00f3's designs and serial production began soon after. The first installation, at 16&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz, was in 1932 on the 56&nbsp;km section of the Hungarian State Railways between Budapest and [[Kom\u00e1rom]]. This proved successful and the electrification was extended to [[Hegyeshalom]] in 1934.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273\u2013274}}\n\n[[File:Biaschina Intermodal.jpg|thumb|A Swiss [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 420|Re 420]] leads a freight train down the south side of the [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard line]], which was electrified in 1922. The masts and lines of the catenary can be seen.]]\nIn Europe, electrification projects initially focused on mountainous regions for several reasons: coal supplies were difficult, [[hydroelectric power]] was readily available, and electric locomotives gave more traction on steeper lines. This was particularly applicable in Switzerland, where almost all lines are electrified. An important contribution to the wider adoption of AC traction came from [[SNCF]] of France after [[World War II]]. The company had assessed the industrial-frequency AC line routed through the steep [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental Valley]], Germany, which was under French administration following the war. After trials, the company decided that the performance of AC locomotives was sufficiently developed to allow all its future installations, regardless of terrain, to be of this standard, with its associated cheaper and more efficient infrastructure.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}} The SNCF decision, ignoring as it did the {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} of high-voltage DC already installed on French routes, was influential in the standard selected for other countries in Europe.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}}\n\nThe 1960s saw the electrification of many European main lines. European electric locomotive technology had improved steadily from the 1920s onwards. By comparison, the [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2]] (1918) weighed 240&nbsp;t, with a power of 3,330&nbsp;kW and a maximum speed of 112&nbsp;km/h; in 1935, German [[DRG Class E 18|E 18]] had a power of 2,800&nbsp;kW, but weighed only 108 tons and had a maximum speed of 150&nbsp;km/h. On 29 March 1955, French locomotive [[SNCF Class CC 7100|CC 7107]] reached 331&nbsp;km/h. In 1960 the [[SJ Dm3|SJ Class Dm 3]] locomotives on Swedish Railways produced a record 7,200&nbsp;kW. Locomotives capable of commercial passenger service at 200&nbsp;km/h appeared in Germany and France in the same period. Further improvements resulted from the introduction of electronic control systems, which permitted the use of increasingly lighter and more powerful motors that could be fitted inside the bogies (standardizing from the 1990s onwards on asynchronous three-phase motors, fed through GTO-inverters).\n\nIn the 1980s, the development of very high-speed service brought further electrification. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] and the French [[TGV]] were the first systems for which devoted high-speed lines were built from scratch. Similar programs were undertaken in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]; in the United States the only new mainline service was an extension of electrification over the Northeast Corridor from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], though new electric [[light rail]] systems continued to be built.\n\nOn 2 September 2006, a standard production Siemens electric locomotive of the [[EuroSprinter|Eurosprinter type ES64-U4]] ([[\u00d6BB]] Class 1216) achieved {{convert|357|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the record for a locomotive-hauled train, on the new line between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg.<ref>{{cite web \n  |url=http://transportation.siemens.com/ts/en/pub/products/lm/services/platforms/eurosprinter.htm\n  |title=World Record Speed: 357&nbsp;km/h.

The wheel controls motor power.]]\n[[File:DC Electric Locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Electric locomotive used in mining operations in [[Flin Flon, Manitoba]]. This locomotive is on display and not currently in service.]]\n\nAn electric locomotive can be supplied with power from\n*[[Rechargeable energy storage system]]s, such as battery or [[ultracapacitor]]-powered [[mining]] locomotives.\n* A stationary source, such as a [[third rail]] or [[overhead line|overhead wire]].\n\nThe distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:\n*The type of electrical power used, [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]].\n*The method of storing (batteries, ultracapacitors) or collecting (transmission) electrical power.\n*The means used to couple the [[traction motors]] to the driving wheels (drivers).\n\n===Direct and alternating current===\nThe most fundamental difference lies in the choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and insulation material for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission system losses.\n\nAs AC motors were developed, they became the predominant type, particularly on longer routes. High voltages (tens of thousands of volts) are used because this allows the use of low currents; [[copper loss|transmission losses]] are proportional to the square of the current (e.g. twice the current means four times the loss). Thus, high power can be conducted over long distances on lighter and cheaper wires. Transformers in the locomotives transform this power to a low voltage and high current for the motors.<ref>[[Alternating current#Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply]]</ref> A similar high voltage, low current system could not be employed with direct current locomotives because there is no easy way to do the voltage/current transformation for DC so efficiently as achieved by AC transformers.\n\nAC traction still occasionally uses dual overhead wires instead of single-phase lines. The resulting [[three-phase]] current drives [[induction motor]]s, which do not have sensitive [[commutator (electric)|commutators]] and permit easy realisation of a [[regenerative brake]]. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss [[rack railway]]s. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.\n[[File:SJ night train in the Bj\u00f6rnfjell.jpg|thumb|The Swedish [[SJ Rc|Rc locomotive]] was the first series locomotive that used [[thyristor]]s with DC motors.]]\n[[Rectifier]] locomotives, which used AC power transmission and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities.{{explain|date=October 2015}} Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|three-phase AC induction motors]]. These polyphase machines are powered from [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO]]-, [[IGCT]]- or [[IGBT]]-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices in a modern locomotive can be up to 50% of the cost of the vehicle.\n\nElectric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of the train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending locomotives can produce a large portion of the power required for ascending trains. Most systems have a characteristic voltage and, in the case of AC power, a system frequency. Many locomotives have been equipped to handle multiple voltages and frequencies as systems came to overlap or were upgraded. American [[FL9]] locomotives were equipped to handle power from two different electrical systems and could also operate as diesel-electrics.\n\nWhile today's systems predominantly operate on AC, many DC systems are still in use \u2013 e.g., in [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (750 V and 1,500 V); [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]], [[Ireland]] (1,500 V); [[Slovenia]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]] (3,000 V) and [[Washington, D.C.]] (750 V).\n\n===Power transmission===\n[[File:Pantograaf lichtrail.jpg|thumb|A modern half-[[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]]]]\n[[File:WMATA third rail at West Falls Church.jpg|thumb|Third rail at the [[West Falls Church (WMATA station)|West Falls Church]] [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station near Washington, D.C., electrified at 750&nbsp;volts. The third rail is at the top of the image, with a white canopy above it. The two lower rails are the ordinary running rails; current from the third rail returns to the power station through these.]]\n{{See also|Railway electrification system}}\n\nElectrical circuits require two connections (or for [[Three-phase|three phase AC]], three connections). From the beginning, the track was used for one side of the circuit. Unlike [[model railroad]]s the track normally supplies only one side, the other side(s) of the circuit being provided separately.\n\n====Overhead lines====\nRailways generally tend to prefer [[overhead lines]], often called \"[[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|catenaries]]\" after the support system used to hold the wire parallel to the ground. Three collection methods are possible:\n\n*[[Trolley pole]]: a long flexible pole, which engages the line with a wheel or shoe.\n*[[Bow collector]]: a frame that holds a long collecting rod against the wire.\n*[[Pantograph (rail)|Pantograph]]: a hinged frame that holds the collecting shoes against the wire in a fixed geometry.\n\nOf the three, the pantograph method is best suited for high-speed operation. Some locomotives use both overhead and third rail collection (e.g. [[British Rail Class 92]]).\nIn Europe the recommended geometry and shape of pantographs are defined by standard EN 50367/IEC 60486<ref>{{cite book| last=EN 50367/IEC 60486 |title=Railway applications - Current collection systems - Technical criteria for the interaction between pantograph and overhead line (to achieve free access)}}</ref>\n\n====Third rail====\nThe original [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] electrification used a sliding shoe in an overhead channel, a system quickly found to be unsatisfactory. It was replaced by a [[third rail]], in which a pickup (the \"shoe\") rode underneath or on top of a smaller rail parallel to the main track, above ground level. There were multiple pickups on both sides of the locomotive in order to accommodate the breaks in the third rail required by trackwork. This system is preferred in [[Subway (rail)|subway]]s because of the close clearances it affords.\n\n===Driving the wheels===\n[[File:MILW Bi-Polar.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] \"Bi-polar\" electrics]]\nDuring the initial development of railroad electrical propulsion, a number of drive systems were devised to couple the output of the [[traction motor]]s to the wheels. Early locomotives often used [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the jackshaft through a set of gears. This system was employed because the first traction motors were too large and heavy to mount directly on the axles. Due to the number of mechanical parts involved, frequent maintenance was necessary. The jackshaft drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed,\n\nSeveral other systems were devised as the electric locomotive matured. The [[Buchli drive]] was a fully spring-loaded system, in which the weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French [[SNCF]] and [[Swiss Federal Railways]]. The [[quill drive]] was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or to the side of the axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The [[PRR GG1|Pennsylvania Railroad GG1]] locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.\n\nAnother drive was the \"[[bipolar electric motor|bi-polar]]\" system, in which the motor armature was the axle itself, the frame and field assembly of the motor being attached to the truck (bogie) in a fixed position. The motor had two field poles, which allowed a limited amount of vertical movement of the armature. This system was of limited value since the power output of each motor was limited. The [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] bi-polar electrics used by the [[Milwaukee Road]] compensated for this problem by using a large number of powered axles.\n\nModern electric locomotives, like their [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]] counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, one side of the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by [[Gear#Spur|spur gearing]], in which a [[pinion]] on the motor shaft engages a [[bull gear]] on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.\n\n===Wheel arrangements===\n[[File:PRR GG1 4890 at NRM, Green Bay, 20040426.jpg|thumb|A [[GG1]] electric locomotive]]\nThe [[Whyte notation]] system for classifying [[steam locomotive]]s is not adequate for describing the variety of electric locomotive arrangements, though the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] applied [[class (locomotive)|classes]] to its electric locomotives as if they were steam. For example, the [[PRR GG1]] class indicates that it is arranged like two [[4-6-0]] class G locomotives coupled back-to-back.\n\n[[UIC classification]] system was typically used for electric locomotives, as it could handle the complex arrangements of powered and unpowered axles and could distinguish between coupled and uncoupled drive systems.\n\n===Battery locomotive{{anchor|Battery locomotive|Battery-electric locomotive|Storage battery locomotive|Battery electric locomotive}}===\n[[File:Battery loco 16 at West Ham.JPG|thumb|right|A [[London Underground]] battery-electric locomotive at [[West Ham station]] used for hauling engineers' trains]]\nA battery-electric locomotive (or battery locomotive) is powered by on-board batteries; a kind of [[battery electric vehicle]].\n\nSuch locomotives are used where a diesel or conventional electric locomotive would be unsuitable. An example is maintenance trains on electrified lines when the electricity supply is turned off. Another use for battery locomotives is in industrial facilities (e.g. explosives factories, oil and gas [[refineries]] or chemical factories) where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., [[steam locomotive|steam-]] or [[diesel locomotive|diesel-]]powered) could cause a safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by [[Trolley pole|trolley-powered]] units [[Electric arc|arcing]] at the collection shoes, or where [[electrical resistance]] could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strako\u0161|first=Vladim\u00edr|title=Mine Planning and Equipment Selection |year=1997|publisher=Balkema|location=Rotterdam, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-5410-915-0|page=435|display-authors=etal}}</ref> [[Mine railway#Battery|Mine railways]] often use battery locomotives.\n\nThe first electric locomotive built in 1837 was a battery locomotive. It was built by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]], and it was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Another early example was at the [[Kennecott, Alaska|Kennecott Copper Mine]], [[Latouche, Alaska]], wherein 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of {{convert|4+1/2|ST|LT t}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=George Curtis|title=Mineral resources of Alaska|year=1919|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|page=144}}</ref> In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series electric locomotives with onboard batteries. These locomotives weighed {{convert|85|ST|LT t}} and operated on 750 volt [[Overhead line|overhead trolley wire]] with considerable further range whilst running on batteries.<ref>[http://utahrails.net/bingham/kcc-diesel-elec-loco.php#700-elec List of Kennecott Copper locomotives]</ref>  The locomotives provided several decades of service using [[Nickel-iron battery]] (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]], and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The others can be seen at the [[Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad]], Iowa, and at the [[Western Railway Museum]] in Rio Vista, California.\n\nThe [[Toronto Transit Commission]] previously operated a battery electric locomotive built by [[Nippon-Sharyo]] in 1968 and retired in 2009.<ref>http://transittoronto.ca/subway/5510.shtml</ref>\n\nLondon Underground regularly operates [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery-electric locomotives]] for general maintenance work.\n\n==Electric traction around the world==\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:NorthEasternRailwayNo1-Locomotion-Shildon-April2008.JPG|thumb|250px|NER No.1, Locomotion museum, Shildon]]\n[[Image: Locomotiva E656-569.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[FS Class E656]], an articulated Bo'-Bo'-Bo' locomotive, manages more easily the tight curves often found on the Italian railways]]\n\nElectrification is widespread in Europe. Due to higher density schedules, operating costs are more dominant with respect to the infrastructure costs than in the U.S. and electric locomotives have much lower operating costs than diesel. In addition, governments were motivated to electrify their railway networks due to coal shortages experienced during the First and Second World Wars.\n\nDiesel locomotives have less power compared to electric locomotives for the same weight and dimensions. For instance, the 2,200&nbsp;kW of a modern [[British Rail Class 66]] was matched in 1927 by the electric [[SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/7]] (2,300&nbsp;kW), which is lighter. However, for low speeds, tractive effort is more important than power. This is why diesel engines are competitive for slow freight traffic (as it is common in Canada and the U.S) but not for passenger or mixed passenger/freight traffic like on many European railway lines, especially where heavy freight trains must be run at comparatively high speeds (80&nbsp;km/h or more).\n\nThese factors led to high degrees of electrification in most European countries. In some countries like Switzerland, even electric shunters are common and many private sidings can be served by electric locomotives. During [[World War II]], when materials to build new electric locomotives were not available, [[Swiss Federal Railways]] installed electric heating elements, fed from the overhead supply, in the boilers of [[Electric-steam locomotive|some steam shunters]] to deal with the shortage of imported coal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Arthur Morton|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Co|location=London|year=1950|edition=7|volume=2|page=389|oclc=39200150}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/swisselec/swisselc.htm|title=The Swiss Electric-Steam Locomotives|last=Self|first=Douglas|date=December 2003|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\nRecent political developments in many European countries to enhance public transit have led to another boost for electric traction. High-speed trains like the [[TGV]], [[InterCityExpress|ICE]], [[AVE]] and [[Pendolino]] can only be run economically using electric traction and the operation of branch lines is usually less in deficit when using electric traction, due to cheaper and faster rolling stock and more passengers due to more frequent service and more comfort. In addition, gaps of the un-electrified track are closed to avoid replacing electric locomotives by diesel for these sections. The necessary modernization and electrification of these lines is possible due to the financing of the railway infrastructure by the state.\n\n=== Russia and former USSR ===\n{{see also|Railway electrification in the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437 \u0412\u041b60\u043a-1196.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet electric locomotive VL60<sup>p</sup><sub>k</sub> (\u0412\u041b60<sup>\u043f</sup><sub>\u043a</sub>), c. 1960]]\n[[File:Electric locomotive.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet electric locomotive VL-23 (\u0412\u041b-23)]]\n[[Russia]] and other countries of the former [[USSR]] have a mix of 3,000 V DC and 25 kV AC for historical reasons.\n\nThe special \"junction stations\" (around 15 over the former USSR - [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk etc.) have wiring switchable from DC to AC. Locomotive replacement is essential at these stations and is performed together with the contact wiring switching.\n\nMost Soviet, Czech (the USSR ordered passenger electric locomotives from [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]]), Russian and Ukrainian locomotives can operate on AC or DC only. For instance, [[VL80]] is an AC machine, with VL10 a DC version. There were some half-experimental small series like VL82, which could switch from AC to DC and were used in small amounts around the city of [[Kharkov]] in [[Ukraine]]. Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP10 is dual-system.\n\nHistorically, 3,000 V DC was used for simplicity. The first experimental track was in Georgian mountains, then the suburban zones of the largest cities were electrified for EMUs - very advantageous due to much better dynamic of such a train compared to the steam one, which is important for suburban service with frequent stops. Then the large mountain line between [[Ufa]] and [[Chelyabinsk]] was electrified.\n\nFor some time, electric railways were only considered to be suitable for suburban or mountain lines. In around 1950, a decision was made (according to legend, by [[Joseph Stalin]]) to electrify the highly loaded plain prairie line of [[Omsk]]-[[Novosibirsk]]. After this, electrifying the major railroads at 3,000 V DC became mainstream.\n\n25 kV AC started in the USSR in around 1960, when the industry managed to build the rectifier-based AC-wire DC-motor locomotive (all Soviet and Czech AC locomotives were such; only the post-Soviet ones switched to electronically controlled induction motors). The first major line with AC power was Mariinsk-Krasnoyarsk-Tayshet-Zima; the lines in European Russia like Moscow-Rostov-on-Don followed.\n\nIn the 1990s, some DC lines were rebuilt as AC to allow the usage of the huge 10 MWt AC locomotive of VL85. The line around [[Irkutsk]] is one of them. The DC locomotives freed by this rebuild were transferred to the St Petersburg region.\n\nThe [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] has been partly electrified since 1929, entirely since 2002. The system is 25 kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz after the junction station of Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk, 3,000 V DC before it, and train weights are up to 6,000 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF|title=Comments on the Regional Railroad Network and Power Grid Interconnection|author= Boris DYNKIN, Far Eastern State Transport University, Khabarovsk| accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125020500/http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF |archivedate = November 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n====Canada====\n[[File:Montreal (3782223411).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[CN Boxcab Electric]] locomotive leaving [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], 1989.]]\nHistorically, [[Canada]] has used a variety of electric locomotives, primarily for moving passengers and cargo through poorly ventilated tunnels.

Mass transit systems and other electrified commuter lines use [[electric multiple unit]]s, where each car is powered. All other long-distance passenger service and, with [[Deseret Power Railroad|rare exceptions]], all freight is hauled by diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nIn North America, the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relatively low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter is the use of electric locomotives by Amtrak and [[commuter railroad]]s in the Northeast. [[New Jersey Transit]] New York corridor uses [[ALP-46]] electric locomotives, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and the [[North River Tunnels|Hudson]] and [[East River Tunnels]] leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Station use [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|dual-mode]] locomotives that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station. Electric locomotives are planned for the [[California High-Speed Rail]] system.\n\nDuring the steam era, some mountainous areas were electrified but these have been discontinued. The junction between electrified and non-electrified territory is the locale of engine changes; for example, [[Amtrak]] trains had extended stops in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], as locomotives were swapped, a delay which contributed to the decision to electrify the New Haven to Boston segment of the [[Northeast Corridor]] in 2000.<ref>\"New York to Boston, underwire - Amtrak begins all-electric Northeast Corridor service between Boston and Washington, D.C\", ''Railway Age'', March 2000, accessed from [https://web.archive.org/web/20060504010847/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_3_201/ai_61640435 FindArticles.com] on 28 Sep. 2006.</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====India====\nAll mainline electrified routes in India use [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead electrification at 50&nbsp;Hz.

The frequency of the AC power supply is 50&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in Eastern Japan and 60&nbsp;Hz in Western Japan.\n\nJapan has come close to complete electrification largely due to the relatively short distances and mountainous terrain, which make electric service a particularly economical investment.

Additional efficiency can be gained from [[regenerative braking]], which allows [[kinetic energy]] to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line. Newer electric locomotives use AC motor-inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance. Power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives are ideal for [[commuter rail]] service with frequent stops. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can also come from clean or [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]], including [[geothermal power]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]], [[nuclear power]], [[solar power]] and [[wind turbine]]s.<ref name=\"Hay1982\">{{cite book|last=Hay|first=William W|title=Railroad engineering|volume=1|year=1982|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-36400-9|page=137|chapter=The economics of electrification}}</ref> Electric locomotives usually cost 20% less than diesel locomotives, their maintenance costs are 25-35% lower, and cost up to 50% less to run. <ref>https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/electrification-of-u.s.-railways-pie-in-the-sky-or-realistic-goal</ref>\n\nThe chief disadvantage of electrification is the high cost for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car & freight truck emissions, in order to limit the amount of carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources.<ref>{{cite web |title=EPA, Transportation and Air Quality  |url=https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/locomotives.htm}}</ref> Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling to make the necessary investments for electrification. In Europe and elsewhere, railway networks are considered part of the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Direct current ===\n[[File:1879 Siemens & Halske Wernerwerk Electric locomotive.jpg|thumb|1879 Siemens & Halske experimental train]][[File:B&O 1895 loco.png|thumb|Electric locomotive of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]], US 1895: The steam locomotive was not detached for passage through the tunnel.

The locomotive was driven by a 2.2&nbsp;kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13&nbsp;km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-metre-long (984&nbsp;feet) circular track. The electricity (150&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.\n\nThe world's first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see [[Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway]] and [[Berlin Stra\u00dfenbahn]]). [[Volk's Electric Railway]] opened in 1883 in Brighton. Also in 1883, [[M\u00f6dling and Hinterbr\u00fchl Tram]] opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line.

Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically-worked [[rapid transit|underground]] line was the [[City and South London Railway]], prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting the use of steam power.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Badsey-Ellis\n | first =Antony\n | title =London's Lost Tube Schemes\n | publisher = Capital Transport\n | year = 2005\n | location = Harrow\n | page = 36\n | isbn = 978-1-85414-293-1 \n}}</ref> It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by [[Mather and Platt]]. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of [[multiple-unit train control]] in 1897. Surface and elevated [[rapid transit]] systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.\n\nThe first use of electrification on an American main line was on a four-mile stretch of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B&O to the new line to New York through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore's downtown. Parallel tracks on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had shown that coal smoke from [[steam locomotive]]s would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three [[UIC classification#Bo+Bo|Bo+Bo]] units were initially used, at the south end of the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels.<ref>''B&O Power'', Sagle, Lawrence, Alvin Stauffer</ref> Railroad entrances to [[New York City]] required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the [[Harlem River]] after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the [[New York Central Railroad]]. In the 1930s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].\n\nThe [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (the Milwaukee Road), the last transcontinental line to be built, electrified its lines across the [[Rocky Mountains]] and to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]], electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic and the use of electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=241}} Diesel shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the [[Deseret Power Railroad]]), by 2000 electrification was confined to the [[Northeast Corridor]] and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesel. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread. 1,500&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz is used by high-speed trains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Alternating current===\n\nThe first practical [[Alternating current|AC]] electric locomotive was designed by [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown|Charles Brown]], then working for [[Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon|Oerlikon]], Z\u00fcrich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission, using [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase AC]], between a [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric plant]] at [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] West, a distance of 280&nbsp;km. Using experience he had gained while working for [[Heilmann locomotive|Jean Heilmann]] on steam-electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that [[AC motor#Three-phase AC synchronous motors|three-phase motors]] had a higher power-to-weight ratio than [[Direct current|DC]] motors and, because of the absence of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], were simpler to manufacture and maintain.{{efn-lr|Heilmann evaluated both AC and DC electric transmission for his locomotives, but eventually settled on a design based on [[Thomas Edison]]'s DC system.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=39\u201341}}}}  However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor [[bogie]]s: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=129}}\n\nIn 1894, Hungarian engineer [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]] developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. \nKand\u00f3's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]] (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.<ref>{{cite book\n  |author=Andrew L.

After WW2, 3 kV&nbsp;DC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=L'esperimento a 10 Kv 45 Hz (1928\u20131944)\n  |url=http://www.ilmondodeitreni.it/trifase_parte_3.htm\n  |website=Il Mondo dei Treni\n}}</ref>\n\nA later development of Kand\u00f3, working with both the [[Ganz]] works and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Societa Italiana Westinghouse]], was an [[Rotary phase converter|electro-mechanical converter]], allowing the use of three-phase motors from single-phase AC, eliminating the need for two overhead wires.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=117}} In 1923, the first phase-converter locomotive in Hungary was constructed on the basis of Kand\u00f3's designs and serial production began soon after. The first installation, at 16&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz, was in 1932 on the 56&nbsp;km section of the Hungarian State Railways between Budapest and [[Kom\u00e1rom]]. This proved successful and the electrification was extended to [[Hegyeshalom]] in 1934.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273\u2013274}}\n\n[[File:Biaschina Intermodal.jpg|thumb|A Swiss [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 420|Re 420]] leads a freight train down the south side of the [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard line]], which was electrified in 1922. The masts and lines of the catenary can be seen.]]\nIn Europe, electrification projects initially focused on mountainous regions for several reasons: coal supplies were difficult, [[hydroelectric power]] was readily available, and electric locomotives gave more traction on steeper lines. This was particularly applicable in Switzerland, where almost all lines are electrified. An important contribution to the wider adoption of AC traction came from [[SNCF]] of France after [[World War II]]. The company had assessed the industrial-frequency AC line routed through the steep [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental Valley]], Germany, which was under French administration following the war. After trials, the company decided that the performance of AC locomotives was sufficiently developed to allow all its future installations, regardless of terrain, to be of this standard, with its associated cheaper and more efficient infrastructure.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}} The SNCF decision, ignoring as it did the {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} of high-voltage DC already installed on French routes, was influential in the standard selected for other countries in Europe.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}}\n\nThe 1960s saw the electrification of many European main lines. European electric locomotive technology had improved steadily from the 1920s onwards. By comparison, the [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2]] (1918) weighed 240&nbsp;t, with a power of 3,330&nbsp;kW and a maximum speed of 112&nbsp;km/h; in 1935, German [[DRG Class E 18|E 18]] had a power of 2,800&nbsp;kW, but weighed only 108 tons and had a maximum speed of 150&nbsp;km/h. On 29 March 1955, French locomotive [[SNCF Class CC 7100|CC 7107]] reached 331&nbsp;km/h. In 1960 the [[SJ Dm3|SJ Class Dm 3]] locomotives on Swedish Railways produced a record 7,200&nbsp;kW. Locomotives capable of commercial passenger service at 200&nbsp;km/h appeared in Germany and France in the same period. Further improvements resulted from the introduction of electronic control systems, which permitted the use of increasingly lighter and more powerful motors that could be fitted inside the bogies (standardizing from the 1990s onwards on asynchronous three-phase motors, fed through GTO-inverters).\n\nIn the 1980s, the development of very high-speed service brought further electrification. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] and the French [[TGV]] were the first systems for which devoted high-speed lines were built from scratch. Similar programs were undertaken in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]; in the United States the only new mainline service was an extension of electrification over the Northeast Corridor from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], though new electric [[light rail]] systems continued to be built.\n\nOn 2 September 2006, a standard production Siemens electric locomotive of the [[EuroSprinter|Eurosprinter type ES64-U4]] ([[\u00d6BB]] Class 1216) achieved {{convert|357|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the record for a locomotive-hauled train, on the new line between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg.<ref>{{cite web \n  |url=http://transportation.siemens.com/ts/en/pub/products/lm/services/platforms/eurosprinter.htm\n  |title=World Record Speed: 357&nbsp;km/h.

The wheel controls motor power.]]\n[[File:DC Electric Locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Electric locomotive used in mining operations in [[Flin Flon, Manitoba]]. This locomotive is on display and not currently in service.]]\n\nAn electric locomotive can be supplied with power from\n*[[Rechargeable energy storage system]]s, such as battery or [[ultracapacitor]]-powered [[mining]] locomotives.\n* A stationary source, such as a [[third rail]] or [[overhead line|overhead wire]].\n\nThe distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:\n*The type of electrical power used, [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]].\n*The method of storing (batteries, ultracapacitors) or collecting (transmission) electrical power.\n*The means used to couple the [[traction motors]] to the driving wheels (drivers).\n\n===Direct and alternating current===\nThe most fundamental difference lies in the choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and insulation material for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission system losses.\n\nAs AC motors were developed, they became the predominant type, particularly on longer routes. High voltages (tens of thousands of volts) are used because this allows the use of low currents; [[copper loss|transmission losses]] are proportional to the square of the current (e.g. twice the current means four times the loss). Thus, high power can be conducted over long distances on lighter and cheaper wires. Transformers in the locomotives transform this power to a low voltage and high current for the motors.<ref>[[Alternating current#Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply]]</ref> A similar high voltage, low current system could not be employed with direct current locomotives because there is no easy way to do the voltage/current transformation for DC so efficiently as achieved by AC transformers.\n\nAC traction still occasionally uses dual overhead wires instead of single-phase lines. The resulting [[three-phase]] current drives [[induction motor]]s, which do not have sensitive [[commutator (electric)|commutators]] and permit easy realisation of a [[regenerative brake]]. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss [[rack railway]]s. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.\n[[File:SJ night train in the Bj\u00f6rnfjell.jpg|thumb|The Swedish [[SJ Rc|Rc locomotive]] was the first series locomotive that used [[thyristor]]s with DC motors.]]\n[[Rectifier]] locomotives, which used AC power transmission and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities.{{explain|date=October 2015}} Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|three-phase AC induction motors]]. These polyphase machines are powered from [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO]]-, [[IGCT]]- or [[IGBT]]-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices in a modern locomotive can be up to 50% of the cost of the vehicle.\n\nElectric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of the train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending locomotives can produce a large portion of the power required for ascending trains. Most systems have a characteristic voltage and, in the case of AC power, a system frequency. Many locomotives have been equipped to handle multiple voltages and frequencies as systems came to overlap or were upgraded. American [[FL9]] locomotives were equipped to handle power from two different electrical systems and could also operate as diesel-electrics.\n\nWhile today's systems predominantly operate on AC, many DC systems are still in use \u2013 e.g., in [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (750 V and 1,500 V); [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]], [[Ireland]] (1,500 V); [[Slovenia]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]] (3,000 V) and [[Washington, D.C.]] (750 V).\n\n===Power transmission===\n[[File:Pantograaf lichtrail.jpg|thumb|A modern half-[[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]]]]\n[[File:WMATA third rail at West Falls Church.jpg|thumb|Third rail at the [[West Falls Church (WMATA station)|West Falls Church]] [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station near Washington, D.C., electrified at 750&nbsp;volts. The third rail is at the top of the image, with a white canopy above it. The two lower rails are the ordinary running rails; current from the third rail returns to the power station through these.]]\n{{See also|Railway electrification system}}\n\nElectrical circuits require two connections (or for [[Three-phase|three phase AC]], three connections). From the beginning, the track was used for one side of the circuit. Unlike [[model railroad]]s the track normally supplies only one side, the other side(s) of the circuit being provided separately.\n\n====Overhead lines====\nRailways generally tend to prefer [[overhead lines]], often called \"[[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|catenaries]]\" after the support system used to hold the wire parallel to the ground. Three collection methods are possible:\n\n*[[Trolley pole]]: a long flexible pole, which engages the line with a wheel or shoe.\n*[[Bow collector]]: a frame that holds a long collecting rod against the wire.\n*[[Pantograph (rail)|Pantograph]]: a hinged frame that holds the collecting shoes against the wire in a fixed geometry.\n\nOf the three, the pantograph method is best suited for high-speed operation. Some locomotives use both overhead and third rail collection (e.g. [[British Rail Class 92]]).\nIn Europe the recommended geometry and shape of pantographs are defined by standard EN 50367/IEC 60486<ref>{{cite book| last=EN 50367/IEC 60486 |title=Railway applications - Current collection systems - Technical criteria for the interaction between pantograph and overhead line (to achieve free access)}}</ref>\n\n====Third rail====\nThe original [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] electrification used a sliding shoe in an overhead channel, a system quickly found to be unsatisfactory. It was replaced by a [[third rail]], in which a pickup (the \"shoe\") rode underneath or on top of a smaller rail parallel to the main track, above ground level. There were multiple pickups on both sides of the locomotive in order to accommodate the breaks in the third rail required by trackwork. This system is preferred in [[Subway (rail)|subway]]s because of the close clearances it affords.\n\n===Driving the wheels===\n[[File:MILW Bi-Polar.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] \"Bi-polar\" electrics]]\nDuring the initial development of railroad electrical propulsion, a number of drive systems were devised to couple the output of the [[traction motor]]s to the wheels. Early locomotives often used [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the jackshaft through a set of gears. This system was employed because the first traction motors were too large and heavy to mount directly on the axles. Due to the number of mechanical parts involved, frequent maintenance was necessary. The jackshaft drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed,\n\nSeveral other systems were devised as the electric locomotive matured. The [[Buchli drive]] was a fully spring-loaded system, in which the weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French [[SNCF]] and [[Swiss Federal Railways]]. The [[quill drive]] was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or to the side of the axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The [[PRR GG1|Pennsylvania Railroad GG1]] locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.\n\nAnother drive was the \"[[bipolar electric motor|bi-polar]]\" system, in which the motor armature was the axle itself, the frame and field assembly of the motor being attached to the truck (bogie) in a fixed position. The motor had two field poles, which allowed a limited amount of vertical movement of the armature. This system was of limited value since the power output of each motor was limited. The [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] bi-polar electrics used by the [[Milwaukee Road]] compensated for this problem by using a large number of powered axles.\n\nModern electric locomotives, like their [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]] counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, one side of the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by [[Gear#Spur|spur gearing]], in which a [[pinion]] on the motor shaft engages a [[bull gear]] on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.\n\n===Wheel arrangements===\n[[File:PRR GG1 4890 at NRM, Green Bay, 20040426.jpg|thumb|A [[GG1]] electric locomotive]]\nThe [[Whyte notation]] system for classifying [[steam locomotive]]s is not adequate for describing the variety of electric locomotive arrangements, though the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] applied [[class (locomotive)|classes]] to its electric locomotives as if they were steam. For example, the [[PRR GG1]] class indicates that it is arranged like two [[4-6-0]] class G locomotives coupled back-to-back.\n\n[[UIC classification]] system was typically used for electric locomotives, as it could handle the complex arrangements of powered and unpowered axles and could distinguish between coupled and uncoupled drive systems.\n\n===Battery locomotive{{anchor|Battery locomotive|Battery-electric locomotive|Storage battery locomotive|Battery electric locomotive}}===\n[[File:Battery loco 16 at West Ham.JPG|thumb|right|A [[London Underground]] battery-electric locomotive at [[West Ham station]] used for hauling engineers' trains]]\nA battery-electric locomotive (or battery locomotive) is powered by on-board batteries; a kind of [[battery electric vehicle]].\n\nSuch locomotives are used where a diesel or conventional electric locomotive would be unsuitable. An example is maintenance trains on electrified lines when the electricity supply is turned off. Another use for battery locomotives is in industrial facilities (e.g. explosives factories, oil and gas [[refineries]] or chemical factories) where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., [[steam locomotive|steam-]] or [[diesel locomotive|diesel-]]powered) could cause a safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by [[Trolley pole|trolley-powered]] units [[Electric arc|arcing]] at the collection shoes, or where [[electrical resistance]] could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strako\u0161|first=Vladim\u00edr|title=Mine Planning and Equipment Selection |year=1997|publisher=Balkema|location=Rotterdam, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-5410-915-0|page=435|display-authors=etal}}</ref> [[Mine railway#Battery|Mine railways]] often use battery locomotives.\n\nThe first electric locomotive built in 1837 was a battery locomotive. It was built by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]], and it was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Another early example was at the [[Kennecott, Alaska|Kennecott Copper Mine]], [[Latouche, Alaska]], wherein 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of {{convert|4+1/2|ST|LT t}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=George Curtis|title=Mineral resources of Alaska|year=1919|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|page=144}}</ref> In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series electric locomotives with onboard batteries. These locomotives weighed {{convert|85|ST|LT t}} and operated on 750 volt [[Overhead line|overhead trolley wire]] with considerable further range whilst running on batteries.<ref>[http://utahrails.net/bingham/kcc-diesel-elec-loco.php#700-elec List of Kennecott Copper locomotives]</ref>  The locomotives provided several decades of service using [[Nickel-iron battery]] (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]], and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The others can be seen at the [[Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad]], Iowa, and at the [[Western Railway Museum]] in Rio Vista, California.\n\nThe [[Toronto Transit Commission]] previously operated a battery electric locomotive built by [[Nippon-Sharyo]] in 1968 and retired in 2009.<ref>http://transittoronto.ca/subway/5510.shtml</ref>\n\nLondon Underground regularly operates [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery-electric locomotives]] for general maintenance work.\n\n==Electric traction around the world==\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:NorthEasternRailwayNo1-Locomotion-Shildon-April2008.JPG|thumb|250px|NER No.1, Locomotion museum, Shildon]]\n[[Image: Locomotiva E656-569.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[FS Class E656]], an articulated Bo'-Bo'-Bo' locomotive, manages more easily the tight curves often found on the Italian railways]]\n\nElectrification is widespread in Europe. Due to higher density schedules, operating costs are more dominant with respect to the infrastructure costs than in the U.S. and electric locomotives have much lower operating costs than diesel. In addition, governments were motivated to electrify their railway networks due to coal shortages experienced during the First and Second World Wars.\n\nDiesel locomotives have less power compared to electric locomotives for the same weight and dimensions. For instance, the 2,200&nbsp;kW of a modern [[British Rail Class 66]] was matched in 1927 by the electric [[SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/7]] (2,300&nbsp;kW), which is lighter. However, for low speeds, tractive effort is more important than power. This is why diesel engines are competitive for slow freight traffic (as it is common in Canada and the U.S) but not for passenger or mixed passenger/freight traffic like on many European railway lines, especially where heavy freight trains must be run at comparatively high speeds (80&nbsp;km/h or more).\n\nThese factors led to high degrees of electrification in most European countries. In some countries like Switzerland, even electric shunters are common and many private sidings can be served by electric locomotives. During [[World War II]], when materials to build new electric locomotives were not available, [[Swiss Federal Railways]] installed electric heating elements, fed from the overhead supply, in the boilers of [[Electric-steam locomotive|some steam shunters]] to deal with the shortage of imported coal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Arthur Morton|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Co|location=London|year=1950|edition=7|volume=2|page=389|oclc=39200150}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/swisselec/swisselc.htm|title=The Swiss Electric-Steam Locomotives|last=Self|first=Douglas|date=December 2003|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\nRecent political developments in many European countries to enhance public transit have led to another boost for electric traction. High-speed trains like the [[TGV]], [[InterCityExpress|ICE]], [[AVE]] and [[Pendolino]] can only be run economically using electric traction and the operation of branch lines is usually less in deficit when using electric traction, due to cheaper and faster rolling stock and more passengers due to more frequent service and more comfort. In addition, gaps of the un-electrified track are closed to avoid replacing electric locomotives by diesel for these sections. The necessary modernization and electrification of these lines is possible due to the financing of the railway infrastructure by the state.\n\n=== Russia and former USSR ===\n{{see also|Railway electrification in the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437 \u0412\u041b60\u043a-1196.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet electric locomotive VL60<sup>p</sup><sub>k</sub> (\u0412\u041b60<sup>\u043f</sup><sub>\u043a</sub>), c. 1960]]\n[[File:Electric locomotive.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet electric locomotive VL-23 (\u0412\u041b-23)]]\n[[Russia]] and other countries of the former [[USSR]] have a mix of 3,000 V DC and 25 kV AC for historical reasons.\n\nThe special \"junction stations\" (around 15 over the former USSR - [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk etc.) have wiring switchable from DC to AC. Locomotive replacement is essential at these stations and is performed together with the contact wiring switching.\n\nMost Soviet, Czech (the USSR ordered passenger electric locomotives from [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]]), Russian and Ukrainian locomotives can operate on AC or DC only. For instance, [[VL80]] is an AC machine, with VL10 a DC version. There were some half-experimental small series like VL82, which could switch from AC to DC and were used in small amounts around the city of [[Kharkov]] in [[Ukraine]]. Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP10 is dual-system.\n\nHistorically, 3,000 V DC was used for simplicity. The first experimental track was in Georgian mountains, then the suburban zones of the largest cities were electrified for EMUs - very advantageous due to much better dynamic of such a train compared to the steam one, which is important for suburban service with frequent stops. Then the large mountain line between [[Ufa]] and [[Chelyabinsk]] was electrified.\n\nFor some time, electric railways were only considered to be suitable for suburban or mountain lines. In around 1950, a decision was made (according to legend, by [[Joseph Stalin]]) to electrify the highly loaded plain prairie line of [[Omsk]]-[[Novosibirsk]]. After this, electrifying the major railroads at 3,000 V DC became mainstream.\n\n25 kV AC started in the USSR in around 1960, when the industry managed to build the rectifier-based AC-wire DC-motor locomotive (all Soviet and Czech AC locomotives were such; only the post-Soviet ones switched to electronically controlled induction motors). The first major line with AC power was Mariinsk-Krasnoyarsk-Tayshet-Zima; the lines in European Russia like Moscow-Rostov-on-Don followed.\n\nIn the 1990s, some DC lines were rebuilt as AC to allow the usage of the huge 10 MWt AC locomotive of VL85. The line around [[Irkutsk]] is one of them. The DC locomotives freed by this rebuild were transferred to the St Petersburg region.\n\nThe [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] has been partly electrified since 1929, entirely since 2002. The system is 25 kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz after the junction station of Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk, 3,000 V DC before it, and train weights are up to 6,000 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF|title=Comments on the Regional Railroad Network and Power Grid Interconnection|author= Boris DYNKIN, Far Eastern State Transport University, Khabarovsk| accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125020500/http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF |archivedate = November 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\n====Canada====\n[[File:Montreal (3782223411).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[CN Boxcab Electric]] locomotive leaving [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], 1989.]]\nHistorically, [[Canada]] has used a variety of electric locomotives, primarily for moving passengers and cargo through poorly ventilated tunnels.

Mass transit systems and other electrified commuter lines use [[electric multiple unit]]s, where each car is powered. All other long-distance passenger service and, with [[Deseret Power Railroad|rare exceptions]], all freight is hauled by diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nIn North America, the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relatively low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter is the use of electric locomotives by Amtrak and [[commuter railroad]]s in the Northeast. [[New Jersey Transit]] New York corridor uses [[ALP-46]] electric locomotives, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and the [[North River Tunnels|Hudson]] and [[East River Tunnels]] leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Station use [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|dual-mode]] locomotives that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station. Electric locomotives are planned for the [[California High-Speed Rail]] system.\n\nDuring the steam era, some mountainous areas were electrified but these have been discontinued. The junction between electrified and non-electrified territory is the locale of engine changes; for example, [[Amtrak]] trains had extended stops in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], as locomotives were swapped, a delay which contributed to the decision to electrify the New Haven to Boston segment of the [[Northeast Corridor]] in 2000.<ref>\"New York to Boston, underwire - Amtrak begins all-electric Northeast Corridor service between Boston and Washington, D.C\", ''Railway Age'', March 2000, accessed from [https://web.archive.org/web/20060504010847/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_3_201/ai_61640435 FindArticles.com] on 28 Sep. 2006.</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====India====\nAll mainline electrified routes in India use [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead electrification at 50&nbsp;Hz.

The frequency of the AC power supply is 50&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in Eastern Japan and 60&nbsp;Hz in Western Japan.\n\nJapan has come close to complete electrification largely due to the relatively short distances and mountainous terrain, which make electric service a particularly economical investment.

Its replacement in 1579 was destroyed by raiders. The present church was built in 1675.<ref>\"Hindu temples and deities\" by Rui Gomes Pereira</ref><ref>\"Gomantak Prakruti ani Sanskruti\" by B.D.Satoskar</ref>\n\n===Damodar Temple===\n\nThe initial settlement of Marg\u00e3o grew from the site of the ancient Damodar Temple. The original temple was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] was filled up to be replaced by the Holy Spirit church and church grounds{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. The deity [[Damodar (name of Krishna)|Damodar]] (a form of Lord Vishnu) was carried across the [[Zuari]] Agranashini river to the Novas Conquistas in which the Sonde rulers resided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} While the western side of the Holy Spirit Church developed as a market place, the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region, with the Holy Spirit Church, Margao at its core and extended outwards.\n\n===Camara Municipal de Salcete===\nThe Municipality during the erstwhile Portuguese regime was known as \"C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete\",<ref name=\" Camara Municipal de Salcete\">[http://www.mmcmargao.gov.in/aboutUs.aspx]</ref> catering to all the villages in Salcete Taluka for over 300 years until the Goa Municipalities Act of 1968 came into force. The C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete is now reconstituted into Margao Municipal Council. The Members of the C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete were then nominated by the Government, but after the reconstitution of the Municipal Council, the Members to all the 20 wards (10 in Margao & 10 in Fatorda) are elected by the Members of the council.\n\n===The Holy Spirit Church===\n\nThe Largo de Igreja, or the Church of the Holy Spirit, was built by the Portuguese in 1675 and boasts a pristine white fa\u00e7ade and an interior dripping with gilt crystal and stucco. The Municipal Garden square is defined on one side by the church with its baroque architecture and the parochial house, and on the other side by the palatial mansions of affluent elite Catholics, positioned in a row. The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o das Communidades'' (Communities Association) building and the school being the odd exceptions which add to its character and sense of scale. They have a maximum height of two stories, and ''balc\u00f5es'' [[balcony|balconies]] and ''varandas'' ([[veranda]]s) facing the square. Parallel to the church square is the commercial street (old market). There is also a landscaped area next to the church called ''Pra\u00e7a da Alegria'' (Joy Square). The church feast is celebrated before the monsoons, it is a time when many residents make pre-monsoon purchases to stock up for a prolonged rainy season.\n\nMarg\u00e3o's importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative center with the town hall at its center being built in the south.\n\nIn 1961, Goa was freed from [[Portugal|Portuguese]] occupation and incorporated into the [[Indian Union]], and Marg\u00e3o was declared as the administrative center of the district of [[South Goa]].\n\n==Geography==\nMargao is located at {{Coord|15|16|25|N|73|57|29|E}}.
