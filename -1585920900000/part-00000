The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment [[pheomelanin]], which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2\u20133 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of {{convert|200|to|230|kg|lb}} and can grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger\u2019s stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |title=White Bengal Tiger |website=Animal Corner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401075203/http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |archive-date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nFor a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (''Panthera tigris tigris'') as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos.\n\n== Stripeless tigers ==\n[[File:Whitetigermirage.jpg|thumb|A tiger with almost no stripes at [[The Mirage]] in [[Las Vegas]], the [[United States]] of America]]\n\nAn additional genetic condition can result in near-complete absence of stripes, making the tiger almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as \"A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light.\"<ref name=\"cuvier\">{{cite book |last=Cuvier |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Cuvier |title=The Animal Kingdom they can grow to as tall as |publisher=G & C & H Carvill |year=1832}}</ref> Naturalist [[Richard Lydekker]] said that, \"a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820.\"<ref name=\"lydekker1\">{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |authorlink=Richard Lydekker |title=The Royal Natural History |url=https://archive.org/details/royalnaturalhist06lyde |publisher=Frederick Warne |year=1893}}</ref> Hamilton Smith said, \"A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.\", and [[John George Wood]] stated that, \"a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights.\" [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] also drew this tigress in 1824.\n\nThe modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother\u2013sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. The gene involved may have come from a [[Siberian tiger]], their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Liberec#Zoo and botanical garden|Liberec]]), [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]]. Stage magicians [[Siegfried & Roy]] were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar-Kabul) and [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo.<ref name=\"providing2007\">{{Cite news |title=Litter of white tigers debuts in Mexico |date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19627911 |website=NBC News }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, a blue-eyed, stripeless white tiger was born in a wildlife refuge in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]].

Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino [[ferret]]s. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the [[optic chiasm]]. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some [[optic nerve]]s are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.<ref name=\"Gorham\">Gorham, Mary Ellen, DVM.

Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by \"tiger man\" Kailash Sankhala in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to [[inbreeding depression]].<ref name=\"sankhala1977\"/> A condition known as \"star-gazing\" (the head and neck are raised almost straight up, as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars), which is associated with inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers.<ref name=\"Gorham\"/> Some white tigers born to North American lines have ''bulldog'' faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes.

Mohan, a large white tiger, died just short of his 20th birthday, an enviable age for a male of any subspecies, since most males live shorter captive lives. Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions...in 52 births we had four stillbirths, one of which was an unexplained loss.

Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain.

The protector of the mystical world of Shangri-La in [[Far Cry 4]] is a white tiger that allies with the protagonist to defeat demons.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 August 2014 |url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-shangri-la/ |title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 The Legend of Shangri-La |publisher=Ubisoft Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nBoth the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' and the Japanese ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series on which the ''Power Rangers'' series is based, have had white tiger themed Rangers and [[mecha]]. A trained white tiger from the Bowmanville Zoo in [[Ontario]], Canada, was used in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' TV series. A [[superhero]] named White Tiger appears in \"The Justice Friends\" in ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]''. A white tiger named White Blaze is frequently shown in the anime ''[[Ronin Warriors]]''. Tigatron from the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars]]'' is based on the white tiger.  There have been at least four heroes in Marvel comics called \"The White Tiger\": two gained powers from a group of three mystic amulets that they possessed, one was actually a tigress evolved by the High Evolutionary, and one was given an artificial version of the \"Black Panther's Heart Shaped Herb\".\n\n[[Kylie Chan|Kylie Chan's]] ''Dark Heavens'' series incorporates the four winds of [[Chinese mythology]] \u2013 including [[Bai Hu|The White Tiger]]. In ''[[Hayate the Combat Butler]]'', Tama, Nagi Sanzenin's pet tiger, is a white tiger. In Colleen Houck's series beginning with the novel ''Tiger's Curse'', one of the main characters, Ren, is shown as a white tiger. In 2013, a white tiger used for an election campaign in [[Lahore]], Pakistan, died of dehydration.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2321891/Electioneered-death-Rare-white-tiger-used-Pakistani-campaign-mascot-dies-dehydration-30C-heat.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Electioneered to its death: Rare white tiger used as Pakistani campaign mascot dies of dehydration in 30C heat |author=Helen Lawson |work=Daily Mail |date=9 May 2013 |access-date=26 May 2013}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=September 2019}} A white tiger named Mantecore was used as part of [[Siegfried & Roy]]'s ''Siegfried & Roy at the Mirage Resort and Casino'' magical show.

The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment [[pheomelanin]], which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2\u20133 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of {{convert|200|to|230|kg|lb}} and can grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger\u2019s stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |title=White Bengal Tiger |website=Animal Corner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401075203/http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/rainforests/bengalwhite.html |archive-date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nFor a white Bengal tiger to be born, both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (''Panthera tigris tigris'') as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies.<ref name=\"animalcorner.co.uk\"/> Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos.\n\n== Stripeless tigers ==\n[[File:Whitetigermirage.jpg|thumb|A tiger with almost no stripes at [[The Mirage]] in [[Las Vegas]], the [[United States]] of America]]\n\nAn additional genetic condition can result in near-complete absence of stripes, making the tiger almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as \"A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light.\"<ref name=\"cuvier\">{{cite book |last=Cuvier |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Cuvier |title=The Animal Kingdom they can grow to as tall as |publisher=G & C & H Carvill |year=1832}}</ref> Naturalist [[Richard Lydekker]] said that, \"a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820.\"<ref name=\"lydekker1\">{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |authorlink=Richard Lydekker |title=The Royal Natural History |url=https://archive.org/details/royalnaturalhist06lyde |publisher=Frederick Warne |year=1893}}</ref> Hamilton Smith said, \"A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.\", and [[John George Wood]] stated that, \"a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights.\" [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] also drew this tigress in 1824.\n\nThe modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother\u2013sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]. The gene involved may have come from a [[Siberian tiger]], their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Liberec#Zoo and botanical garden|Liberec]]), [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]]. Stage magicians [[Siegfried & Roy]] were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar-Kabul) and [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo.<ref name=\"providing2007\">{{Cite news |title=Litter of white tigers debuts in Mexico |date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19627911 |website=NBC News }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, a blue-eyed, stripeless white tiger was born in a wildlife refuge in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]].

Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino [[ferret]]s. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the [[optic chiasm]]. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some [[optic nerve]]s are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.<ref name=\"Gorham\">Gorham, Mary Ellen, DVM.

Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by \"tiger man\" Kailash Sankhala in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to [[inbreeding depression]].<ref name=\"sankhala1977\"/> A condition known as \"star-gazing\" (the head and neck are raised almost straight up, as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars), which is associated with inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers.<ref name=\"Gorham\"/> Some white tigers born to North American lines have ''bulldog'' faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes. However, some of these traits may be linked to poor diet rather than inbreeding.\n\nThere was a {{convert|450|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} male cross-eyed white tiger at the [[Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo]] in [[Hawaii]], which was donated to the zoo by [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] magician Dirk Arthur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilo Area Attractions |website=tripsavvy |date=12 December 2017 |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/hilo-area-attractions-1532636 |author=Fischer, John |access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> There is a picture of a white tiger which appears to be cross-eyed on just one side in Siegfried & Roy's book ''Mastering The Impossible''.

However, the infant mortality rate for white tigers is no higher than it is for normal orange tigers bred in captivity. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska said: \"We have not experienced premature death among our white tigers. Forty-two animals born in our collection are still alive. Mohan, a large white tiger, died just short of his 20th birthday, an enviable age for a male of any subspecies, since most males live shorter captive lives. Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions...in 52 births we had four stillbirths, one of which was an unexplained loss. We lost two additional cubs from viral pneumonia, which is not excessive. Without data from non-inbred tiger lines, it is difficult to determine whether this number is high or low with any degree of accuracy.\"<ref name=\"Maruska\"/> Ed Maruska also addressed the issue of deformities: \"Other than a case of hip dysplasia that occurred in a male white tiger, we have not encountered any other body deformities or any physiological or neurological disorders.

A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers. A man named Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he sold to [[Marwell Wildlife|Marwell Zoo]] in England developed white spots, and bred them accordingly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mutant Big Cats-White Tiger (Page 2) |url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/tigers-white2.htm |website=Hybrid and Mutant Animals}}</ref> The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa Bay had four of these white Amur tigers, descended from Robert Baudy's stock.\n\nIt has also been possible to expand the white-gene pool by [[outcrossing]] white tigers with unrelated orange tigers and then using the cubs to produce more white tigers. The white tigers Ranjit, Bharat, Priya and Bhim were all outcrossed, in some instances to more than one tiger. Bharat was bred to an unrelated orange tiger named Jack from the [[San Francisco Zoo]] and had an orange daughter named Kanchana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tongren|first=Sally|title=To keep them alive|location=New York|publisher=Dembner Books: Distributed by Norton|year=1985|isbn=978-0934878661|url=https://archive.org/details/tokeepthemalivew0000tong}}</ref> Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from [[Knoxville Zoo]], and Ranjit was bred to this tiger's sister, also from Knoxville Zoo.

Rajiv, Pretoria Zoo's white tiger, who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo, was also outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo. Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain. The New Delhi Zoo loaned out white tigers to some of India's better zoos for outcrossing, and the government had to impose a [[Whip (politics)|whip]] to force zoos to return either the white tigers or their orange offspring.\n\n[[File:WhiteTiger25.jpg|thumb|left|A Bengal tiger at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]]]]\nSiegfried & Roy performed at least one outcross.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Fischbacher|first=Siegfried|author2=Horn, Roy Uwe Ludwig|author3=Tapert, Annette|title=Siegfried and Roy: mastering the impossible|isbn=978-0688105518|location=New York|publisher=W.

The first person to speak out against the displaying of white tigers was [[William G. Conway]], General Director of the New York Zoological Society, which later became known as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] when he said, \"White tigers are freaks.  It's not the role of a zoo to show two headed calves and white tigers.\"  He warned AZA in 1983 of the harm to the zoo's credibility in catering to the public's fascination with freaks, but went unheeded until 2008 when AZA issued a request to their members to stop breeding white tigers and then later in July 2011 when the AZA formally adopted that stance as policy.

Manson appeared to have borrowed his philosophy from the [[Process Church of the Final Judgment]], whose members believed [[Satan]] would become reconciled to [[Jesus|Christ]] and they would come together at the [[end time|end of the world]] to judge humanity.

Sometime around 1967, he began using the alias \"Charles Willis Manson.\" He often said it very slowly (\"Charles's Will Is Man's Son\")\u2014implying that his will was the same as that of the [[Son of man|Son of Man]].<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|315}}\n\nBefore the end of the summer, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed.

Stromberg thought that Manson made interesting suggestions about what Jesus might do in a situation, seeming to be attuned to the role. He had one of his women kiss his feet and then kiss hers in return to demonstrate the place of women. At the beach one day, Stromberg watched while Manson preached against a materialistic outlook, only to be questioned about his well-furnished bus. He casually tossed the bus keys to the doubter, who promptly drove it away while Manson watched, apparently unconcerned.<ref>''Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson''.

This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|399\u2013407}}\n\n==== Conviction and penalty phase ====\nOn January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|411\u2013419}} Not far into the trial's [[bifurcation (law)|penalty phase]], the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson\u2014in the prosecution's view\u2014had planned to present.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|455}}  Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as \"copycat\" versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil\u2014[[Linda Kasabian]].<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|424\u2013433}} Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written \"political piggy\" at the Hinman house in the first place.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|424\u2013433, 450\u2013457}}\n\nMidway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, \"I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.\"<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|439}} In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the death penalty.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|439, 455}}\n\nThe effort to exonerate Manson via the \"copy cat\" scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|450\u2013457}} On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|458\u2013459}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===1970s\u20131980s===\nOn the day the verdicts recommending the death penalty were returned, news came that the badly decomposed body of Ronald Hughes had been found wedged between two boulders in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|457}} It was rumored, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes.<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|387, 394, 481}} Though he might have perished in flooding,<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|393\u2013394, 481}}<ref>Sanders 2002, 436\u201338.</ref> Family member [[Sandra Good]] stated that Hughes was \"the first of the retaliation murders\".<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|481\u2013482, 625}}\n\nWatson returned to McKinney, Texas after the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders. He was arrested in Texas on November 30, 1969, after local police were notified by California investigators that his fingerprints were found to match a print found on the front door of the Tate home. Watson fought extradition to California long enough that he was not included among the three defendants tried with Manson.<ref>Extradition of Charles 'Tex' Watson</ref> The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson's insanity claims.

Manson appeared to have borrowed his philosophy from the [[Process Church of the Final Judgment]], whose members believed [[Satan]] would become reconciled to [[Jesus|Christ]] and they would come together at the [[end time|end of the world]] to judge humanity.

Sometime around 1967, he began using the alias \"Charles Willis Manson.\" He often said it very slowly (\"Charles's Will Is Man's Son\")\u2014implying that his will was the same as that of the [[Son of man|Son of Man]].<ref name=\"bugliosi\" />{{Rp|315}}\n\nBefore the end of the summer, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed.
