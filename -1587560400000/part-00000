Arwen is one of the [[half-elven]] (Peredhil) who lived during the [[Third Age]]. The name is not Welsh in origin.\n\n==Literature==\n\nArwen was the youngest child of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebr\u00edan]]. Her elder brothers were the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Her name ''\"Ar-wen\"'' means 'noble maiden' in [[Sindarin]]. She bore the [[sobriquet]] \"Evenstar\" ([[Venus|Evening Star]]), as the most beautiful of the last generation of [[Calaquendi|High Elves]] in [[Middle-earth]].\n\n{{Quote box|\n|quote  = Arwen said: \"Dark is the Shadow, and yet my heart rejoices; for you, Estel, shall be among the great whose valour will destroy it.\"<br>\nBut Aragorn answered: \"Alas!

Yet there lies the land of my people and the long home of all my kin.\" She loved her father dearly.\n |author = [[J.R.R.

Arwen, then over 2,700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living with her grandmother [[Lady Galadriel]] in [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight. 30 years later, the two were reunited in L\u00f3rien.  Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love, and on the mound of Cerin Amroth they committed themselves to marry each other. In making that choice, Arwen gave up the Elvish immortality available to her as a daughter of Elrond and agreed to remain in Middle-earth instead of traveling to the [[Undying Lands]].\n\nArwen first appears in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in Rivendell, shortly after [[Frodo Baggins]] wakes in the House of Elrond: she sits beside her father at the celebratory feast. When the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] comes to Lothl\u00f3rien, Aragorn remembers his earlier meeting with Arwen and pauses in reverence.\n\nShortly before Aragorn takes the Paths of the Dead, he is joined by a contingent of his people accompanied by Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, who bring him a gift from Arwen: a banner of black cloth. The banner is unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to reveal the emblem of [[Elendil]] figured in ''mithril'', gems, and gold; this becomes the first triumphant public announcement of the king's return.\n\nAfter the ring is destroyed, Aragorn becomes king of Arnor and [[Gondor]]. Arwen arrives at [[Minas Tirith]], and they are married. She gives Frodo '''the Evenstar''': her necklace with a white stone, to aid him when his injuries trouble him.\n\nArwen is a minor character in ''The Lord of the Rings'', but she serves as inspiration and motivation for Aragorn, who must become King of both Arnor and Gondor before Elrond will allow her to marry him.\n\n''The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen'' relates that Aragorn and Arwen had a son, Eldarion, and at least two unnamed daughters. One year after Aragorn's death,  Arwen dies at the age of 2,901.\n\n===Background===\nThrough her father, Elrond, Arwen was the granddaughter of [[E\u00e4rendil]] the Mariner (the second of the Half-elven), great-granddaughter of [[Tuor]] of [[Gondolin]], and therefore a direct descendant of the ancient House of Hador. Through her great-grandmother, Idril, Arwen was also a descendant of King Turgon of the [[Noldor]]. Through her mother, she was the granddaughter of Lady [[Galadriel]] and the great-granddaughter of Finarfin. [[\u00c9omer]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] said that the Lady Arwen was fairer than the Lady Galadriel of L\u00f3rien, but [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli son of Gl\u00f3in]] thought differently. Through both of her parents, Arwen was a direct descendant of the ancient Elven House of Finw\u00eb. Furthermore, Arwen was a descendant of [[Beren]] and [[L\u00fathien|L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel]], whose [[The Tale of Beren and L\u00fathien|story]] resembled hers. Indeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her ancestor L\u00fathien, fairest of all the [[Elves (Middle-earth)|Elves]], who was called Nightingale (Tin\u00faviel).\n\nArwen was a very distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's ancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of [[N\u00famenor]], was her father Elrond's brother, who chose to live as a [[Man (Middle-earth)|Man]] rather than as one of the Eldar. Arwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of Arnor. By Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the Half-elven were joined.  Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves (Ingw\u00eb, [[Finw\u00eb]], and the brothers Olw\u00eb and [[Elw\u00eb]]) as well as the only line with [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiarin]] blood through Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of [[Doriath]], and also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and N\u00famenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was also Melian.\n\n{{Half-elven family tree}}\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nAs related in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien conceived the character of \"Elrond's daughter\" late in the writing.<ref name = \"warofthering\">{{ME-ref|WR}}</ref><ref name = \"saurondefeated\">{{ME-ref|SD}}</ref> Prior to this, he considered having Aragorn marry [[\u00c9owyn]].<ref name = \"treason\">{{ME-ref|ToI}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:Arwen by Anna Kulisz.jpg|thumb|left|''Arwen'': painting of Arwen sewing [[Aragorn]]'s standard of the White Tree of [[Gondor]] by Anna Kulisz, inspired by [[Edmund Leighton]]'s 1911 painting ''[[Stitching the Standard]]'']]\n\nArwen does not appear in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', nor in the 1980 [[Rankin-Bass]] adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''.\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, Arwen is played by [[Liv Tyler]].  The films give her a more prominent role than her literary counterpart.\n\nIn the first film, Arwen searches for Aragorn and single-handedly rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. (In the novel, Elrond summons the flood, and [[Glorfindel]] takes Frodo to Rivendell.) During this flight Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]], which according to film merchandise was once wielded by her father and had belonged to his grandmother Idril Celebrindal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_inscriptions.htm#arwensword |title=Language in the Lord of the Rings movie |editor-first=Ryszard |editor-last=Derdzinski |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> In the film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', the injured Aragorn is revived by a dream or vision of Arwen, who kisses him and asks the [[Valar]] to protect him.\n\nThroughout the films [[Elrond]] begs her to accompany her kin to the [[Undying Lands]] because he does not wish to see another of his family die.  Elrond shows her a vision of her sorrow-filled life after Aragorn's death, and tells her that only death awaits her in [[Middle-earth]]. Arwen reluctantly departs for [[Valinor]]. However, on the road to the Grey Havens she has a vision of her future son, Eldarion, which belies her father's one-sided prophecy. She returns to Rivendell, where Elrond admits that her mortal life will have happiness as well as grief, though he stresses that Sauron's rising power means that future is growing more and more distant. Arwen convinces her father to reforge the sword [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|Narsil]] for Aragorn so that he can reclaim the throne of the King. Elrond initially refuses, but eventually agrees when Arwen begins to fall ill through her loss of immortality.\n\nElrond takes Narsil, reforged as [[And\u00faril]], to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]], and tells him that Arwen's fate has become bound to the [[One Ring]], and that she is dying. In the extended version of ''The Return of the King'', [[Sauron]] (through a ''[[palant\u00edr]]'') shows Aragorn a dying Arwen in order to dissuade him from battle. After Sauron's defeat, however, Aragorn reunites with Arwen at his coronation.  The movies portray her as becoming human through her love for Aragorn; as in the novel, Arwen follows the choice of her ancestor L\u00fathien to become a mortal woman for the love of a mortal man.\n\nThe movies introduce a jeweled pendant called the ''Evenstar'' which Arwen gives to Aragorn as a token of their love. A similar pendant appears in the short story ''The Jewel of Arwen'' by [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], although in that story Arwen gives it to \"the Ring-Bearer\" rather than to Aragorn.<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?5357 This story appears in all the fantasy trilogies listed here]</ref> In Tolkien's novel, Arwen gives Frodo \"a white gem like a star...hanging upon a silver chain\" before he leaves Minas Tirith, saying, \"When the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you...this will bring you aid\".<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Tolkien\n|first=J.R.R.\n|chapter=Chapter VI: Many Partings\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/lordofringspartt00jrrt/page/953 953]\n|title=The Return of the King\n|publisher=[[George Allen & Unwin]]\n|date=1954\n|location=London, England\n|isbn=0-00-712972-6\n|OCLC=933993\n|url=https://archive.org/details/lordofringspartt00jrrt/page/953\n}}</ref>\n\nIn earlier versions of the script, when the movies were supposed to be filmed in two parts under another production company, Arwen fought in the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]] and brought the sword And\u00faril to Aragorn.
