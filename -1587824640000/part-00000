It consists of a bronze screen incorporating allegorical figures, set into the garden wall of [[Marlborough House]]. A late example of a work in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, it was regarded by the sculptor as his \"[[Swan song]]\".{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=48}}\n\nBefore 1926 Gilbert was living in exile abroad, having fled Britain in 1901 bankrupt and disgraced after failing to complete the tomb of the  [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Duke of Clarence]] in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]]. Gilbert later claimed that the Duke's mother, Princess Alexandra (Queen Alexandra after her husband's accession to the throne as [[Edward VII]]) was the only member of the royal family who supported him after this debacle. She is also supposed to have expressed a wish in her old age that Gilbert might execute her memorial, should he outlive her.{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=151}}\n\nIn 1926 Gilbert was invited to return to Britain, a result of the machinations of his biographer, the journalist Isabel McAllister. She had the twofold aim of getting Gilbert to complete the Clarence tomb (which he had succeeded in doing by 1928) and to receive the commission for a memorial to Queen Alexandra, who had died the previous year. The artist [[Lady Helena Gleichen]] offered her studio in [[St James's Palace]] for Gilbert's use.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=47}} The Committee to Erect a Memorial to Queen Alexandra was set up in late 1926 and approached Gilbert in December of that year.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=48}}\n\nThe symbolism of the central sculptural group is explained by Gilbert in an \"[[exegesis]]\" he prepared for the Committee in 1927:\n\n{{Quotation|''Central Group''\u2014represents \"Love Enthroned\", supported by Faith and Hope, on either side, and Love is directing a Boy sent out across the \"River of Life\", which springs from beneath Her Throne\u2014symbolizing Queen Alexandra's charity to Children, also the water typifies Her advent to Great Britain from across the water.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}}}} \n\n[[File:London - panoramio (24).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Detail of the central sculptural group]]\n\nThe composition is in a style adapted from [[Perpendicular Gothic]] architecture,{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=150}} with three buttressed and pinnacled canopies over the figures and [[linenfold]] motifs on the screen.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}} Two further allegorical statuettes appear on finials on the throne, that on the left representing ''Religion'' and the other without an attribute to help with identification,{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=151}} though ''Truth'' has been proposed as its subject.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}}\n\nThe two main inscriptions read <small>QUEEN ALEXANDRA/ 1844 A TRIBUTE TO THE EMPIRE\u2019S LOVE 1925</small> (on the bronze base) and  <small>FAITH, HOPE, LOVE./ THE GUIDING VIRTUES OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA</small> (on the granite base below); a further inscription at the side of the bronze base reads <small>A. B. BURTON. FOUNDER</small>.{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=151}}\n\nThe memorial was cast by [[A. B.

It consists of a bronze screen incorporating allegorical figures, set into the garden wall of [[Marlborough House]]. A late example of a work in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, it was regarded by the sculptor as his \"[[Swan song]]\".{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=48}}\n\nBefore 1926 Gilbert was living in exile abroad, having fled Britain in 1901 bankrupt and disgraced after failing to complete the tomb of the  [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Duke of Clarence]] in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]]. Gilbert later claimed that the Duke's mother, Princess Alexandra (Queen Alexandra after her husband's accession to the throne as [[Edward VII]]) was the only member of the royal family who supported him after this debacle. She is also supposed to have expressed a wish in her old age that Gilbert might execute her memorial, should he outlive her.{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=151}}\n\nIn 1926 Gilbert was invited to return to Britain, a result of the machinations of his biographer, the journalist Isabel McAllister. She had the twofold aim of getting Gilbert to complete the Clarence tomb (which he had succeeded in doing by 1928) and to receive the commission for a memorial to Queen Alexandra, who had died the previous year. The artist [[Lady Helena Gleichen]] offered her studio in [[St James's Palace]] for Gilbert's use.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=47}} The Committee to Erect a Memorial to Queen Alexandra was set up in late 1926 and approached Gilbert in December of that year.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=48}}\n\nThe symbolism of the central sculptural group is explained by Gilbert in an \"[[exegesis]]\" he prepared for the Committee in 1927:\n\n{{Quotation|''Central Group''\u2014represents \"Love Enthroned\", supported by Faith and Hope, on either side, and Love is directing a Boy sent out across the \"River of Life\", which springs from beneath Her Throne\u2014symbolizing Queen Alexandra's charity to Children, also the water typifies Her advent to Great Britain from across the water.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}}}} \n\n[[File:London - panoramio (24).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Detail of the central sculptural group]]\n\nThe composition is in a style adapted from [[Perpendicular Gothic]] architecture,{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=150}} with three buttressed and pinnacled canopies over the figures and [[linenfold]] motifs on the screen.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}} Two further allegorical statuettes appear on finials on the throne, that on the left representing ''Religion'' and the other without an attribute to help with identification,{{sfn|Ward-Jackson|2011|p=151}} though ''Truth'' has been proposed as its subject.{{sfn|Dorment|1980|p=51}}\n\nThe two main inscriptions read <small>QUEEN ALEXANDRA/ 1844 A TRIBUTE TO THE EMPIRE\u2019S LOVE 1925</small> (on the bronze base) and  <small>FAITH, HOPE, LOVE./ THE GUIDING VIRTUES OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA</small> (on the granite base below); a further inscription at the side of the bronze base reads <small>A.

{"title_page": "Jazz harmony", "text_new": "[[File:Dominant seventh chord on C.png|thumb|right|225px|Dominant seventh chord on C: C<sup>7</sup> {{audio|Dominant seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}.]]\n\n'''Jazz harmony'''  is the [[music theory|theory]] and practice of how [[chord (music)|chords]] are used in [[jazz]] music. Jazz bears certain similarities to other practices in the tradition of Western [[harmony]], such as many [[chord progressions]], and the incorporation of the [[major and minor]] [[scale (music)|scales]] as a basis for chordal construction. In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in [[major third|major]] or [[minor third]]s, although ''[[quartal harmony|stacked fourths]]'' are also quite common.<ref name=\"Stacking Thirds\" /> Also, jazz music tends to favor certain harmonic progressions and includes the addition of ''tensions'', [[interval (music)|intervals]] such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords. Additionally, [[jazz scales|scales unique to style]] are used as the basis of many harmonic elements found in jazz. Jazz harmony is notable for the use of [[seventh chord]]s as the basic harmonic unit more often than [[triad (music)|triad]]s, as in [[classical music]].<ref name=\"Rawlins 2005\" /> In the words of [[Robert Rawlins]] and Nor Eddine Bahha, \"7th chords provide the building blocks of jazz harmony.\"<ref name=\"Rawlins 2005\" />\n\nThe [[piano]] and [[guitar]] are the two instruments that typically provide harmony for a jazz group. Players of these instruments deal with harmony in a real-time, flowing improvisational context as a matter of course. This is one of the greatest challenges in jazz.\n\nIn a [[big-band]] context, the harmony is the basis for horn material, melodic counterpoint, and so on. The improvising soloist is expected to have a complete knowledge of the basics of harmony, as well as their own unique approach to chords and their relationship to scales. A personal style is composed of these building blocks and a rhythmic concept.\n\nJazz composers use harmony as a basic stylistic element as well. Open, modal harmony is characteristic of the music of [[McCoy Tyner]], whereas rapidly shifting key centers is a hallmark of the middle period of [[John Coltrane]]'s writing. [[Horace Silver]], [[Clare Fischer]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Bill Evans]] are pianists whose compositions are more typical of the chord-rich style associated with pianist-composers. [[Joe Henderson]], [[Woody Shaw]], [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Benny Golson]] are non-pianists who also have a strong sense of the role of harmony in compositional structure and mood. These composers (including also [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charles Mingus]], who recorded infrequently as pianists) have musicianship grounded in chords at the piano, even though they are not performing keyboardists.\n\nThe authentic [[cadence (music)|cadence]] (V-I) is the most important one in both classical and jazz harmony, though in jazz it more often follows a ii/II chord serving as [[predominant]]. To cite Rawlins and Bahha, as above: \"The ii-V-I [progression] provides the cornerstone of jazz harmony\"<ref name=\"Rawlins 2005\" />\n\nThe [[ii-V-I]] ({{Audio|Ii-V-I without subV.ogg|Play ii-V-I}}) may appear differently in major or minor keys, ''m7''-''dom''-''maj7'' or ''m7{{music|b}}5''-''dom{{music|b}}9''-''minor''.<ref name=\"Spitzer 2001\" />\n\nOther central features of jazz harmony are diatonic and non-diatonic reharmonizations, the addition of the V7(sus4) chord as a dominant and non-[[dominant (music)|dominant functioning chord]], major/minor interchange, [[blues]] harmony, [[secondary dominant]]s, [[extended dominant]]s, [[deceptive resolution]], related ii-V7 chords, [[direct modulation]]s, the use of [[contrafacts]], [[common chord modulation]]s, and dominant chord modulations using ii-V progressions.\n\nBebop or \"straight-ahead\" jazz, in which only certain of all possible extensions and alterations are used, is distinguished from free, avant-garde, or post-bop jazz harmony.<ref name=\"Rawlins 2005\" />\n\n==Chord symbols==\nAnalytic practice in Jazz recognizes four basic chord types, plus diminished seventh chords. The four basic chord types are ''[[major seventh chord|major]]'', ''[[minor seventh chord|minor]]'', ''[[minor/major seventh chord|minor-major]]'', and ''[[dominant seventh chord|dominant]]''. When written in a jazz ''chart'', these chords may have ''alterations'' specified in parentheses after the chord symbol. An altered note is a note which is a deviation from the canonical chord tone.\n\nThere is variety in the chord symbols used in jazz notation. A jazz musician must have facility in the alternate notation styles which are used. The following chord symbol examples use C as a root tone for example purposes. \n{|\n!Equivalent symbols||||Chord tones in example key||||Name || Audio\n|-\n|C\u0394, CM7, Cmaj7||||C E G B||||[[major seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Major seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C7||||C E G B{{music|flat}}||||[[dominant seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Dominant seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C-7, Cm7||||C E{{music|b}} G B{{music|b}}||||[[minor seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Minor seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C-\u03947, CmM7, C\u2466||||C E{{music|b}} G B||||[[minor/major seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Minor major seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C\u2205,  Cm7{{music|b}}5,  C-7{{music|b}}5||||C E{{music|b}} G{{music|b}} B{{music|b}}||||[[half-diminished seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Half-diminished seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C{{music|dim}}7,  Cdim7||||C E{{music|b}} G{{music|b}} B{{music|bb}}||||[[diminished seventh chord|fully diminished 7th chord]] || {{Audio|Diminished seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C7sus||||C F G B{{music|b}}||||[[suspended chord|dominant or minor suspended 4th chord]] || {{Audio|Dominant sus4th chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|}\n\nMost [[jazz chord]] symbols designate four notes. Each typically has a \"role\" as ''[[root (chord)|root]]'', ''third'', ''[[fifth (chord)|fifth]]'', or ''seventh'', although they may be severely altered and possibly use an enharmonic spelling which masks this underlying identity. For example, jazz harmony theoretician Jim Knapp has suggested that the {{music|b}}9 and even the {{music|#}}9 alterations are functioning in the root role.\n\nThe jazz chord naming system is as deterministic as the composer wishes it to be. A rule of thumb is that chord alterations are included in a chart only when the alteration appears in the melody or is crucial to essence of the composition. Skilled improvisers are able to supply an idiomatic, highly altered harmonic vocabulary even when written chord symbols contain no alterations.\n\nIt is possible to specify chords with more than four notes. For example, the chord C-\u03949 contains the notes (C E{{music|b}} G B D).\n\n==Melodic Minor Scale==\nMuch of jazz harmony is based on the [[minor scale|melodic minor scale]] (using only the \"ascending\" scale as defined in classical harmony). The modes of this scale are the basis for much jazz improvisation and are variously named as below, using the key of C-minor as an example:\n{|\n!Melodic minor scale tone||||Characteristic chord in C-minor||||Scale tones (chord tones in '''bold''')||||Scale name(s)\n|-\n|I - C||||Cm(\u2206)||||'''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G''' A '''B'''||||[[minor scale|Melodic Minor]]\n|-\n|II - D||||Dm7||||'''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F''' G '''A''' B '''C'''||||Phrygian {{music|#}}6 or Dorian {{music|b}}2\n|-\n|III - E{{music|b}}||||E{{music|b}}\u2206({{music|#}}5)||||'''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G''' A '''B''' C '''D'''||||Lydian {{music|#}}5 or [[Lydian augmented scale|Lydian Augmented]]\n|-\n|IV - F||||F7||||'''F''' G '''A''' B '''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}'''||||Mixolydian {{music|#}}4 or [[Lydian dominant scale|Lydian Dominant]]\n|-\n|V - G||||G7||||'''G''' A '''B''' C '''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F'''||||Mixolydian {{music|b}}6 or \"Hindu\"\n|-\n|VI - A||||A\u2205||||'''A''' B '''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G'''||||[[Half diminished scale|Locrian {{music|#}}2]]\n|-\n|VII - B||||B7alt||||'''B''' C '''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F''' G '''A'''||||[[Altered scale|Altered]], [[whole tone scale|diminished whole tone]], or Locrian {{music|b}}4\n|}\n\nThe VII chord in particular is rich with alterations. As it contains the notes and alterations (\u2160, {{music|b}}9, m3/{{music|#}}9, M3, {{music|b}}5/{{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13, m7), it is particularly important in the jazz harmonic idiom, notably as a \u2164 chord in a minor key. For our example key of C-minor, the V chord is G7, so the improviser would draw upon the G7 altered scale (mode VII of the A{{music|b}} melodic minor). A complete ii-V-i progression in C-minor7 extended 9 flattened fifth might suggest the following:\n{|-\n|ii||||D\u2205||||D Locrian {{music|sharp}}2 (mode \u2165 of the F melodic minor scale)\n|-\n|V||||G7(alt)||||G altered scale (mode VII of the A{{music|b}} melodic minor scale)\n|-\n|I||||Cm(\u2206)||||C melodic minor (mode I of the C melodic minor scale)\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Altered chord]]\n* [[Bebop scale]]\n* [[Chord-scale system]]\n* [[Modal jazz]]\n* [[Tritone substitution]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''Harmonie et orchestration pour orchestra de danse,'' Robert de Kers [[:de:Robert De Kers|(de)]] (1906\u20131987), [[Brussels]]: \u00c9ditions musicales Charles Bens (1944); {{oclc|35083146|930383216|1456272}} & {{oclc|757363748|915601359}}\n* ''The Chord Scale Theory & Jazz Harmony,'' by Barrie L.

The following chord symbol examples use C as a root tone for example purposes. \n{|\n!Equivalent symbols||||Chord tones in example key||||Name || Audio\n|-\n|C\u0394, CM7, Cmaj7||||C E G B||||[[major seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Major seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C7||||C E G B{{music|flat}}||||[[dominant seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Dominant seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C-7, Cm7||||C E{{music|b}} G B{{music|b}}||||[[minor seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Minor seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C-\u03947, CmM7, C\u2466||||C E{{music|b}} G B||||[[minor/major seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Minor major seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C\u2205,  Cm7{{music|b}}5,  C-7{{music|b}}5||||C E{{music|b}} G{{music|b}} B{{music|b}}||||[[half-diminished seventh chord]] || {{Audio|Half-diminished seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C{{music|dim}}7,  Cdim7||||C E{{music|b}} G{{music|b}} B{{music|bb}}||||[[diminished seventh chord|fully diminished 7th chord]] || {{Audio|Diminished seventh chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|-\n|C7sus||||C F G B{{music|b}}||||[[suspended chord|dominant or minor suspended 4th chord]] || {{Audio|Dominant sus4th chord on C.mid|Play}}\n|}\n\nMost [[jazz chord]] symbols designate four notes. Each typically has a \"role\" as ''[[root (chord)|root]]'', ''third'', ''[[fifth (chord)|fifth]]'', or ''seventh'', although they may be severely altered and possibly use an enharmonic spelling which masks this underlying identity. For example, jazz harmony theoretician Jim Knapp has suggested that the {{music|b}}9 and even the {{music|#}}9 alterations are functioning in the root role.\n\nThe jazz chord naming system is as deterministic as the composer wishes it to be. A rule of thumb is that chord alterations are included in a chart only when the alteration appears in the melody or is crucial to essence of the composition. Skilled improvisers are able to supply an idiomatic, highly altered harmonic vocabulary even when written chord symbols contain no alterations.\n\nIt is possible to specify chords with more than four notes. For example, the chord C-\u03949 contains the notes (C E{{music|b}} G B D).\n\n==Melodic Minor Scale==\nMuch of jazz harmony is based on the [[minor scale|melodic minor scale]] (using only the \"ascending\" scale as defined in classical harmony). The modes of this scale are the basis for much jazz improvisation and are variously named as below, using the key of C-minor as an example:\n{|\n!Melodic minor scale tone||||Characteristic chord in C-minor||||Scale tones (chord tones in '''bold''')||||Scale name(s)\n|-\n|I - C||||Cm(\u2206)||||'''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G''' A '''B'''||||[[minor scale|Melodic Minor]]\n|-\n|II - D||||Dm7||||'''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F''' G '''A''' B '''C'''||||Phrygian {{music|#}}6 or Dorian {{music|b}}2\n|-\n|III - E{{music|b}}||||E{{music|b}}\u2206({{music|#}}5)||||'''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G''' A '''B''' C '''D'''||||Lydian {{music|#}}5 or [[Lydian augmented scale|Lydian Augmented]]\n|-\n|IV - F||||F7||||'''F''' G '''A''' B '''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}'''||||Mixolydian {{music|#}}4 or [[Lydian dominant scale|Lydian Dominant]]\n|-\n|V - G||||G7||||'''G''' A '''B''' C '''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F'''||||Mixolydian {{music|b}}6 or \"Hindu\"\n|-\n|VI - A||||A\u2205||||'''A''' B '''C''' D '''E{{music|b}}''' F '''G'''||||[[Half diminished scale|Locrian {{music|#}}2]]\n|-\n|VII - B||||B7alt||||'''B''' C '''D''' E{{music|b}} '''F''' G '''A'''||||[[Altered scale|Altered]], [[whole tone scale|diminished whole tone]], or Locrian {{music|b}}4\n|}\n\nThe VII chord in particular is rich with alterations. As it contains the notes and alterations (\u2160, {{music|b}}9, m3/{{music|#}}9, M3, {{music|b}}5/{{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13, m7), it is particularly important in the jazz harmonic idiom, notably as a \u2164 chord in a minor key. For our example key of C-minor, the V chord is G7, so the improviser would draw upon the G7 altered scale (mode VII of the A{{music|b}} melodic minor). A complete ii-V-i progression in C-minor7 extended 9 flattened fifth might suggest the following:\n{|-\n|ii||||D\u2205||||D Locrian {{music|sharp}}2 (mode \u2165 of the F melodic minor scale)\n|-\n|V||||G7(alt)||||G altered scale (mode VII of the A{{music|b}} melodic minor scale)\n|-\n|I||||Cm(\u2206)||||C melodic minor (mode I of the C melodic minor scale)\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Altered chord]]\n* [[Bebop scale]]\n* [[Chord-scale system]]\n* [[Modal jazz]]\n* [[Tritone substitution]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''Harmonie et orchestration pour orchestra de danse,'' Robert de Kers [[:de:Robert De Kers|(de)]] (1906\u20131987), [[Brussels]]: \u00c9ditions musicales Charles Bens (1944); {{oclc|35083146|930383216|1456272}} & {{oclc|757363748|915601359}}\n* ''The Chord Scale Theory & Jazz Harmony,'' by Barrie L.

name=\"WHO-SR22\" /><ref name=\"BBC-How\" /> and to avoid confusion with the disease [[SARS]],<ref name=\"QZ-Why\" /> it sometimes refers to SARS-CoV-2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications.<ref name=\"COVIDname\" />\n\n==Virology==\n===Infection===\nHuman-to-human [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020, during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Chan24Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"LiMar2020\" /><ref name=\"Kessler17Apr2020\" /><ref name=\"Kuo21Jan2020\" /> Transmission occurs primarily via [[respiratory droplet]]s from coughs and sneezes within a range of about {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|adj=ri1}}.<ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /><ref name=\"NBCSpread\" /> Indirect contact via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected individuals.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[pharynx]] reaches peak [[viral load]] approximately four days after infection<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.<ref name=\"LancetLoad\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from [[asymptomatic]] cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic [[Viral shedding|shedding]] may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" /> Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the greatest amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the [[index case]]\".<ref name=\"NatureTemporalShedding\" />\n\nThere is some evidence of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including examples in [[Felidae|felids]].<ref name=\"oie.int\" /><ref name=\"BronxTiger\" /> Some institutions have advised those infected with SARS-CoV-2 to restrict contact with animals.<ref name=\"USDAtiger\" /><ref name=\"CDCanimals\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2.]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" /> A phylogenetic network analysis of 160 early coronavirus genomes sampled from December 2019 to February 2020 revealed that the virus type most closely related to the bat coronavirus was most abundant in [[Guangdong]], China, and designated type \"A\". The predominant type among samples from Wuhan, \"B\", is more distantly related to the bat coronavirus than the ancestral type \"A\".<ref name=\"PNAS2020\" /><ref name=\"CU2020\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]]. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The [[pangolin]] coronavirus has up to 92% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" />\n\nBats were initially considered to be the most likely [[natural reservoir]] of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus sampled at the time and SARS-CoV-2 suggested that humans were infected via an intermediate host. Arinjay Banerjee at [[McMaster University]] notes that \"the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS virus]] shared 99.8% of its genome with a [[civet]] coronavirus, which is why civets were considered the source.\"<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> Although studies had suggested some likely candidates, the number and identities of intermediate hosts remains uncertain.<ref name=\"IJID-interm-host\" /> Nearly half of the strain's genome had a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.<ref name=\"Rejects\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, [[South China Agricultural University]] in [[Guangzhou]] announced that researchers had discovered a pangolin sample with a single viral [[nucleic acid]] sequence \"99% similar\" to that of a protein-coding [[RNA]] of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> The authors state that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\" The S protein, or [[Peplomer|spike protein]], of the virus binds to the [[Cell surface receptor|cell surface receptor]] during infection.<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nRecent phylogenetic analysis supports the notion that pangolins are a potential reservoir host. However, there is no evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host at this moment. While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that a SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus originated in pangolins, jumped back to bats, and then jumped to humans, resulting in SARS-CoV-2. Based on whole genome sequence similarity, a highly similar pangolin coronavirus candidate strain was found to be less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 but are more similar than other bat coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> Therefore, based on [[maximum parsimony]], a specific population of bats is more likely to have directly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans than a pangolin, while an evolutionary ancestor to bats was the source of general coronaviruses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/coronavirusfrontlines/2020/04/17/a-virologist-explains-why-it-is-unlikely-covid-19-escaped-from-a-lab/ |title=A Virologist Explains Why It Is Unlikely COVID-19 Escaped From A Lab |last=Jason Kindrachuk |publisher=Forbes.com |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Microbiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n| caption = [[Genomic]] organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of SARS-CoV-2\n| type    = nucleotide\n| taxId   = MN908947\n| size    = 29,903 bases\n| year    = 2020\n}}\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as [[coronavirus]]es.<ref name = \"Fox2020\" /> It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment.
