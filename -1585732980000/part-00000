The suite is structurally inspired by the silent movie by [[Robert Siodmak]] and [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[People on Sunday|Menschen Am Sonntag]]'' (1929).\n\nIn June 2004 W\u00f6lk was invited for another composer`s residency in Toronto, Ontario.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.

In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ. Kashgar's annual growth rate was 17.4 percent in 2009, and Kashgar's designation has since increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Real estate in China|real estate prices]] in the city.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

The vehicle used for this ground test will also be used for the following in-flight abort test.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/13/spacex-fires-up-crew-dragon-thrusters-in-key-test-after-april-explosion/</ref>\n\nSome of the modifications are:\n\n* Replacement of the valves with [[burst disc]]s: Unlike valves, burst discs are designed for single use. \n* Adding of flaps on each SuperDracos in order to reseal those thrusters prior to splashdown in the Ocean, preventing water intrusion and make Crew Dragon far easier to refurbish and reuse, also preventing Dragon from sinking.<ref>https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-fires-redesigned-crew-dragon-superdraco-flaps/</ref>\n\n===In-Flight Abort Test===\n[[File:KSC-20200119-PH-AWG04 0008.jpg|thumb|Liftoff of Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test.]]\n\nThe Crew Dragon In-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]] on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the [[troposphere]] at [[transonic]] velocities shortly after passing through [[Max q|max Q]], where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its [[SuperDraco]] abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller [[SpaceX Draco|Draco]] engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing. Dragon 2 splashed down at 15:38:54 UTC just off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-complete-final-major-flight-test-of-crew-spacecraft</ref> The test objective was to demonstrate the ability to safely move away from the ascending rocket under the most challenging atmospheric conditions of the flight trajectory, imposing the worst structural stress of a real flight on the rocket and spacecraft.<ref name=nsf20140828/> The abort test was performed using a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket with a fully fueled second stage with a mass simulator replacing the [[SpaceX Merlin|Merlin]] engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/second-spacex-crew-flight-ordered-nasa/|title=Second SpaceX Crew Flight Ordered by NASA|work=Spaceflight Insider|first=Derek|last=Richardson|date=30 July 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|quote=Currently, the first uncrewed test of the spacecraft is expected to launch in May 2017.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, [[Pope Gregory I]] heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of [[Santa Agata in Suburra]]. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Aelian Bridge]], the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.<ref>Account of [[Pedro Tafur]] in [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch3 ''The Travels of Pero Tafur'' (1435\u20131439)], Chapter III.</ref>\n\n[[File:View from Castel Sant'Angelo 10 (15442805966).jpg|thumb|250px|View from the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo towards the ancient city core of Rome.]]\n\n==Papal fortress, residence and prison==\nThe popes converted the structure into a castle, beginning in the 14th century; [[Pope Nicholas III]] connected the castle to [[St Peter's Basilica]] by a covered fortified corridor called the ''[[Passetto di Borgo]].'' The fortress was the refuge of [[Pope Clement VII]] from the siege of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Landsknecht]]e during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]], in which [[Benvenuto Cellini]] describes strolling the ramparts and shooting enemy soldiers.\n\n[[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] built a chapel with a ''Madonna'' by [[Raffaello da Montelupo]]. In 1536 Montelupo also created a marble statue of [[Saint Michael]] holding his sword after the 590 plague (as described [[#Destruction|above]]) to surmount the Castel.<ref>''Rome'' (Eyewitness Travel Guides) DK Publishing, London (2003) p. 242</ref> Later [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] built a rich apartment, to ensure that in any future siege the pope had an appropriate place to stay.\n\nMontelupo's statue was replaced by a bronze statue of the same subject, executed by the Flemish sculptor [[Peter Anton von Verschaffelt]], in 1753. Verschaffelt's is still in place and Montelupo's can be seen in an open court in the interior of the Castle.\n\nThe Papal state also used Sant'Angelo as a prison; [[Giordano Bruno]], for example, was imprisoned there for six years. Another prisoner was the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]]. Executions were performed in the small inner courtyard. As a prison, it was also the setting for the third act of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s 1900 opera ''[[Tosca]]''; the eponymous heroine leaps to her death from the Castel's ramparts.\n\n==Museum==\nDecommissioned in 1901, the castle is now a museum: the ''Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo''.
