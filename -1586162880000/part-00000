In the last decades, the [[East Turkestan]] independent movement, [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with [[Terrorism in China#Xinjiang|occasional terrorist attacks]] and clashes between separatist and government forces.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite magazine |date = 3 October 2015 |url =

At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Dzungar people]], while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]]. They were governed separately until 1884. The native Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]].\n\nThe Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tian Shan and the Turkic Muslim area south of the Tian Shan, and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false 69]}} However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q&f=false 70]}} The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing and it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather it was the Chinese who held that point of view.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false 67]}} During the Qing rule, no sense of \"regional identity\" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui, and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false 77]}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate parts be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false 78]}}\n\nXinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> (comparable in size to [[Iran]]), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory.

Dzungaria is a dry steppe and the Tarim Basin contains the massive [[Taklamakan Desert]], surrounded by oases. In the east is the [[Turpan Depression]].

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Li\u00e1ng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success. After the final reunification of northern China under the [[Northern Wei]] empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of Xinjiang. Local states such as [[Shule Kingdom|Shule]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Guizi]] and [[Qiemo]] controlled the western region, while the central region around [[Turpan]] was controlled by [[Gaochang]], remnants of a state ([[Northern Liang]]) that once ruled part of what is now [[Gansu]] province in northwestern China.\n\n[[File:Westerner on a camel.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Sogdia]]n man on a [[Bactrian camel]], ''[[sancai]]'' ceramic statuette, [[Tang dynasty]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Tang dynasty]], a [[Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|series of expeditions]] were conducted against the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]], and their vassals, the oasis states of southern Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patricia Buckley |last=Ebrey |title = The Cambridge Illustrated History of China |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-12433-1 |page = 111 }}</ref> [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xiyu states|Campaigns against the oasis states]] began under [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] with the [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexation of Gaochang]] in 640.<ref name=Wechsler>{{cite book |first2=Howard J. |last2=Wechsler |first=Denis |last=Twitchett |chapter=Kao-tsung (reign 649-83) and the Empress Wu: The Inheritor and the Usurper |editor1 = Denis Twitchett |editor2=John Fairbank |title = The Cambridge History of China, Volume 3: Sui and T'ang China Part I |year=1979 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-21446-9 |page=228 }}</ref> The nearby kingdom of [[Karasahr]] was [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|captured by the Tang]] in 644 and the kingdom of [[Kucha]] was [[Conquest of Kucha|conquered in 649]].<ref name=\"skaff\">{{cite book |first=Jonathan Karem |last=Skaff |editor=Nicola Di Cosmo |title=Military Culture in Imperial China |year=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03109-8 |pages=183\u2013185 }}</ref> The Tang Dynasty then established the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u897f\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) or Anxi Protectorate in 640 to control the region.\n\nDuring the devastating [[Anshi Rebellion]], which nearly led to the destruction of the Tang dynasty, [[Tibetan Empire|Tibet]] invaded the Tang on a wide front, from Xinjiang to [[Yunnan]].

Meanwhile, after the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia had been smashed by the Kirghiz in 840, branches of the [[Uyghurs]] established themselves in [[Gaochang|Qocha]] (Karakhoja) and [[Beshbalik]], near the modern cities of Turfan and Urumchi. This Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it was subject to foreign overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but later converted to [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1132, remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion of their neighbors, the [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]], which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>\n\n=== Islamisation of Xinjiang ===\n{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nThe historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion.

The cultural change was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway through the 10th century the Saka Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Islamicisation of the [[Tarim Basin]], the Karakhanid leader [[Yusuf Qadir Khan]] conquered [[Khotan]] around 1006.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nProfessor James A.

In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.\n\nXinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.\n\nDuring the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black

Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n=== Time ===\n{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}\nXinjiang has the same time belt as the rest of China, Beijing time, UTC+8. But while Xinjiang being about two time zones west of Beijing, some residents, local organizations and governments watch another time standard known as [[Xinjiang Time]], UTC+6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |title=The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204115929/http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |archive-date=4 December 2011 }}</ref> Han people tend to use Beijing Time, while Uyghurs tend to use Xinjiang Time as a form of resistance to Beijing.<ref name=Han>{{cite journal |last=Han |first=Enze |title=Boundaries, Discrimination, and Interethnic Conflict in Xinjiang, China |journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2010 |page=251 |url=http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |access-date=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019103838/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> But, regardless of the time standard preferences, most businesses, schools open and close two hours later than in the other regions of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|title=Clocks square off in China's far west|first=Barbara|last=Demick|date=31 March 2009|via=LA Times|access-date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031320/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|archive-date=17 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Deserts ===\nDeserts include:\n* [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''\n* [[Taklamakan Desert]]\n* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan\n\n=== Major cities ===\nDue to the water situation, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges, where irrigated agriculture can be practised.

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China.

The rugged [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and the provinces of [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]]. The most well-known route of the historical [[Silk Road]] ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\n\nIn recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\nIt is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tajiks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Russians in China|Russians]] and [[Xibe people|Xibe]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |work=BBC News |title=Regions and territories: Xinjiang |date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |archive-date=20 May 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang.

Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1954, [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps|Xinjiang Bingtuan]] was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was turned into an [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous region]] from a province. In the last decades, the [[East Turkestan]] independent movement, [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Li\u00e1ng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success.

This Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it was subject to foreign overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but later converted to [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1132, remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion of their neighbors, the [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]], which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>\n\n=== Islamisation of Xinjiang ===\n{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nThe historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion.

The cultural change was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway through the 10th century the Saka Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Islamicisation of the [[Tarim Basin]], the Karakhanid leader [[Yusuf Qadir Khan]] conquered [[Khotan]] around 1006.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nProfessor James A.

[[Four Oirat]]. 3.[[Moghulistan]] 4.[[Qara Del]]]]\n\nAfter [[Genghis Khan]] unified [[Mongolia]] and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.\n\nXinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.\n\nDuring the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and ([[Hui people|Hui]]) moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}\n\n[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|left|The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] ca. 1820]]\nThe native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]] suffered heavily from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

Despite having 9% of Xinjiang's population, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi accounts for 25% of the region's GDP, and many rural Uyghurs have been migrating to that city to seek work in the dominant [[Light industry|light]], [[Heavy industry|heavy]], and [[petrochemical]] industries.{{sfnp|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=178\u2013179}} Hans in Xinjiang are demographically older, better-educated, and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur cohabitants. Hans are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, while some Uyghurs also cite trouble with the law back home and family reasons for their moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.{{sfnp|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=184}} Hans and Uyghurs are equally represented in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi's [[floating population]] that works mostly in commerce.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black

Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n=== Time ===\n{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}\nXinjiang has the same time belt as the rest of China, Beijing time, UTC+8. But while Xinjiang being about two time zones west of Beijing, some residents, local organizations and governments watch another time standard known as [[Xinjiang Time]], UTC+6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |title=The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204115929/http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |archive-date=4 December 2011 }}</ref> Han people tend to use Beijing Time, while Uyghurs tend to use Xinjiang Time as a form of resistance to Beijing.<ref name=Han>{{cite journal |last=Han |first=Enze |title=Boundaries, Discrimination, and Interethnic Conflict in Xinjiang, China |journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2010 |page=251 |url=http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |access-date=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019103838/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> But, regardless of the time standard preferences, most businesses, schools open and close two hours later than in the other regions of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|title=Clocks square off in China's far west|first=Barbara|last=Demick|date=31 March 2009|via=LA Times|access-date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031320/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|archive-date=17 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Deserts ===\nDeserts include:\n* [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''\n* [[Taklamakan Desert]]\n* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan\n\n=== Major cities ===\nDue to the water situation, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges, where irrigated agriculture can be practised.

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China. Hence, there is a noticeable voice of ethnic Uyghurs who would like to separate their region from China. Ironically, the capital of Xinjiang, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, was originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |pp=77\u201378, 133\u2013134}} In retaliation against separatists, China has engaged in \"strike hard\" campaigns since 1996.<ref>''[http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215105736/http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ |date=15 December 2013 }}''</ref> On 5 June 2014, China sentenced nine persons to death for terrorist attacks.

The airfield is located in [[Chilbolton]] approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-southeast of [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]; about {{convert|62|mi|km}} southwest of [[London]]\n\nOpened in 1940, it was used by both the [[Royal Air Force]] and then later by the [[United States Army Air Forces]].  During the war it was used primarily as a troop carrier airfield for parachutists.  After the war it was used for military jet aircraft training before closing as an RAF station in 1946, although it was then used until the early 1960s by the Vickers-Supermarine and Folland aircraft companies for flight testing and development flying.\n\nToday the remains of the airfield are located on private property being used as agricultural fields.\n\n==History==\n\n===Royal Air Force use===\nRAF Chilbolton was opened in September 1940 as a satellite of [[RAF Middle Wallop]] and was used as a relief landing ground by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).  At first it was developed piecemeal with the addition of the necessary facilities that took it towards existence as an independent airfield.  It then hosted its own [[Hawker Hurricane]] squadrons which took part in the [[Battle of Britain]].  [[No. 238 Squadron RAF]] operated throughout the Battle of Britain from Middle Wallop and [[RAF St Eval]] as part of [[No. 10 Group RAF|No. 10 Group]] Fighter Command, posted to Chilbolton in September 1940 with Hurricane Is.\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain many sorties were flown covering [[Southampton]] to [[Bristol]].\nOnce the battle had been won and therefore the threat of invasion had passed major [[Luftwaffe]] raids ceased.  Several [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and Hurricane squadrons came and went, none stayed very long.\n\nBy late 1941 Chilbolton had been upgraded with the addition of a perimeter track and several fighter concrete dispersal pens around it.\n\nBy November 1941 it was placed into Care and Maintenance as there was no use for it by then as the Battle of Britain had ended and there were sufficient airfields in the area to continue the war without it.\n\nRAF Units stationed at Chilbolton:\n* [[No. 238 Squadron RAF|238 Sqn]], Hurricane I, arrived 30 September 1940, departed 20 May 1941.\n* Glider Pilots Exercise Unit, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]/[[Miles Master]]/[[General Aircraft Hotspur]] arrived Dec-Jan 1941.\n* 238 Sqn, Hurricane IIA, arrived 1 February 1941, departed April 1941.\n* [[No. 308 Squadron RAF|308 Sqn]], Spitfire IIA, arrived 31 May 1941, departed 24 June 1941.\n* [[No. 501 Squadron RAF|501 Sqn]], Spitfire IIA, arrived 25 June 1941, departed 5 August 1941.\n* [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|504 Sqn]], Hurricane IIB, arrived 11 August 1941, departed 26 August 1941.\n* [[No. 245 Squadron RAF|245 Sqn]], Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 September 1941, departed 17 Nov 1941.\n* 245 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 23 Nov 1941, departed 19 Dec 1941.\n* [[No. 184 Squadron RAF|184 Sqn]], Hurricane IID, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943.\n* [[No. 174 Squadron RAF|174 Sqn]], Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943.\n\nAmerica came into the war with the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] by the Japanese in late 1941; the Allies began preparations for the invasion of Europe. RAF Chilbolton was then allocated to the Americans and transferred to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) playing host to Army Co-operation Command units.\n\n===USAAF use===\nChilbolton was known as '''USAAF Station AAF-404''' for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location.  Its RAF and USAAF Station Code was \"CB\".\n\n====368th Fighter Group====\nOn 1 March 1944 the 12th and 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons from the 67th Reconnaissance Wing, flying Spitfires and Mustangs, moved in from [[RAF Aldermaston]] to make way for a C-47 group, only to be ejected two weeks later when a new fighter group arrived.  The 368th had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes:\n* 395th Fighter Squadron (A7)\n* 396th Fighter Squadron (C2)\n* 397th Fighter Squadron (D3)\n\nThe 368th was a group of [[Ninth Air Force]]'s [[71st Fighter Wing (World War II)|71st Fighter Wing]], [[IX Tactical Air Command]].  \n \nChilbolton continued to be retained by the USAAF for use by transports as a staging airfield for cargo operations to and from the Continent and it was not returned to the RAF until March 1945 by which time most of the C-47 groups had been transferred to forward stations in France.\n\n===Back to RAF Control===\nIn the hands of the RAF, Chilbolton played host to a fighter Operational Training Unit - [[List of Royal Air Force Operational Training Units|No. 41 OTU]] - for the rest of [[World War II]], and then to several different fighter squadrons equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and [[Hawker Tempest]]s as the RAF reduced its strength at the end of the war.\n* No 41 OTU, Hurricane/Spitfire/Master/Martinet arrived March 1945, disbanded 26 June 1945.\n* [[No. 26 Squadron RAF|26 Sqn]], Mustang I/Spitfire XIV, arrived 23 May 1945, departed 20 August 1945.\n* [[No. 183 Squadron RAF|183 Sqn]], Spitfire IX, arrived 17 June 1945, departed 8 October 1945.\n* [[No. 247 Squadron RAF|247 Sqn]], Tempest F2/Typhoon Ib, arrived 20 August 1945, departed 7 January 1946.\n* [[No. 222 Squadron RAF|222 Sqn]], Tempest V, arrived 10 August 1945, departed 15 August 1945.\n* [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|54 Sqn]], Tempest F2, arrived 15 November 1945, departed 28 June 1946.\n* 183 Sqn, Tempest II, arrived 15 November 1945, disbanded 15 November 1945.\n\n==== Into the 'Jet Age' ====\nIn March 1946, Chilbolton became the first RAF station to operate [[de Havilland Vampire]] jets when [[No. 247 Squadron RAF|247 squadron]] converted to Vampire FB1's, but by the late summer that year the station was on care and maintenance.\n* 247 Sqn, Tempest F2/Vampire F1, arrived 16 February 1946, departed 1 June 1946.\n* 247 Sqn, Vampire F1, arrived 12 June 1946, departed 27 June 1946.\n\n===Post war===\nWith the facility released from military control in 1946, [[Vickers|Vickers Supermarine]] selected the airfield as a location for conducting flight development programmes of their jet prototypes and development aircraft, remaining for the best part of ten years.  [[Supermarine Attacker]], [[Supermarine Swift]] and  [[Supermarine Scimitar]] were developed there as well as many early experimental swept wing jet fighters. The airfield was also used for some location filming of David Lean's classic film, [[The Sound Barrier]] in the early 1950s. The Spitfire T Mk IX, a 2-seat trainer and the last Spitfire variant to be built, was also developed and test flown at Chilbolton for export to India and Eire (Southern Ireland).\n\n[[Folland Aircraft]] also occupied another part of the airfield to conduct similar work on their products, chiefly the Midge and [[Folland Gnat|Gnat]], but were gone by the end of 1961.  With their departure, the wartime airfield began to be dismantled, with large sections of runway, perimeter track and loop hardstands being removed for hardcore.\n\nThe next organisation to take an active interest in the site was the Space Research Council which set about building an observatory with what was to become a prominent local landmark - a radio telescope, known as the [[Chilbolton Observatory]], which was built almost in the centre of the airfield, on the wartime main runway.  When constructed, the north end of the runway was removed, with a two lane access road replacing the runway and connecting to the local road network.   Various other enterprises flourished or faded in the buildings on the periphery of the airfield.\n\nFlying continued on the old airfield during the 1980s when helicopters and light aircraft serving a field spraying organisation were in residence using a grass strip built parallel to the main north\u2013south 12/30 runway.\n\n==Current use==\n\nToday, the perimeter track has been largely reduced to a single-lane farm road as much of the airfield has been returned to agricultural use.  A large section of the 06/24 secondary runway still exists, although reduced to half width.  In aerial photography, however, much of the former wartime airfield's runways and hardstands can be seen as disturbances on the landscape, giving a ghostly appearance to the area. A large Type B.1 hangar also survives in agricultural use on the Leckford Estate which occupies the SW corner of the former airfield.\n\nFlying still takes place at Chilbolton with the Chilbolton Flying Club having established an airstrip on the former playing fields in front of the old RAF gymnasium with planning consent being obtained in 1992. Today club members fly Light aircraft and Ultralights from the airstrip. see http://www.chilboltonflyingclub.co.uk/\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n*[[List of former Royal Air Force stations]]\n\n==References==\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{commons category}}\n* Brooks, Robin.

She began painting seriously in her early 20s, and enrolled at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in 1984.  Sundsten's interest was in [[Representation (arts)|representational painting]], a style which was discouraged in her undergraduate program, and after seeing an [[Odd Nedrum]] exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, she traveled to Oslo to study with him.  She returned to the Art Institute following her informal internship, where she spent the following two years \"defending the unpopular direction\", and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987.

These were a review paper with no new evidence, published in a minor journal, and two papers on laboratory work that he said showed that measles virus had been found in tissue samples taken from children who had autism and bowel problems. There was wide media coverage including distressing anecdotal evidence from parents, and political coverage attacking the health service and government peaked with unmet demands that Prime minister [[Tony Blair]] reveal whether his infant son, Leo, had been given the vaccine. It was the biggest science story of 2002, with 1257 articles mostly written by non-expert commentators. In the period January to September 2002, 32% of the stories written about MMR mentioned Leo Blair, as opposed to only 25% that mentioned Wakefield. Less than a third of the stories mentioned the overwhelming evidence that MMR is safe.<ref name=Goldacre-2008/> The paper, press conference and video sparked a major health scare in the United Kingdom. As a result of the scare, full confidence in MMR fell from 59% to 41% after publication of the Wakefield research. In 2001, 26% of family doctors felt the government had failed to prove there was no link between MMR and autism and bowel disease.<ref name=\"Halvorsen\">{{cite book | author = Halvorsen R | title = The Truth about Vaccines | publisher = Gibson Square | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-903933-92-3}}</ref> In his book ''[[Bad Science (Goldacre book)|Bad Science]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]] describes the MMR vaccine scare as one of the \"three all-time classic bogus science stories\" by the British newspapers (the other two are the Arpad [[Pusztai affair]] about [[genetically modified crops]], and Chris Malyszewicz and the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] hoax).<ref name=book>{{cite book |author=Goldacre, Ben |title= Bad Science|year=2009 |publisher=[[HarperCollins Music Entertainment|Fourth Estate]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728487-0 |page= 283}}</ref>\n\nConfidence in the MMR vaccine increased as it became clearer that Wakefield's claims were unsupported by scientific evidence.

These were a review paper with no new evidence, published in a minor journal, and two papers on laboratory work that he said showed that measles virus had been found in tissue samples taken from children who had autism and bowel problems. There was wide media coverage including distressing anecdotal evidence from parents, and political coverage attacking the health service and government peaked with unmet demands that Prime minister [[Tony Blair]] reveal whether his infant son, Leo, had been given the vaccine. It was the biggest science story of 2002, with 1257 articles mostly written by non-expert commentators. In the period January to September 2002, 32% of the stories written about MMR mentioned Leo Blair, as opposed to only 25% that mentioned Wakefield. Less than a third of the stories mentioned the overwhelming evidence that MMR is safe.<ref name=Goldacre-2008/> The paper, press conference and video sparked a major health scare in the United Kingdom. As a result of the scare, full confidence in MMR fell from 59% to 41% after publication of the Wakefield research. In 2001, 26% of family doctors felt the government had failed to prove there was no link between MMR and autism and bowel disease.<ref name=\"Halvorsen\">{{cite book | author = Halvorsen R | title = The Truth about Vaccines | publisher = Gibson Square | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-903933-92-3}}</ref> In his book ''[[Bad Science (Goldacre book)|Bad Science]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]] describes the MMR vaccine scare as one of the \"three all-time classic bogus science stories\" by the British newspapers (the other two are the Arpad [[Pusztai affair]] about [[genetically modified crops]], and Chris Malyszewicz and the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] hoax).<ref name=book>{{cite book |author=Goldacre, Ben |title= Bad Science|year=2009 |publisher=[[HarperCollins Music Entertainment|Fourth Estate]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728487-0 |page= 283}}</ref>\n\nConfidence in the MMR vaccine increased as it became clearer that Wakefield's claims were unsupported by scientific evidence.
