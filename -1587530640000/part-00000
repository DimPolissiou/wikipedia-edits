A county of Z\u00fcrichgau was established under [[Louis the Pious]], for a count Ruadker, in 820. Z\u00fcrichgau (''Zurichgeuue'') remained a nominally separate territory in the later 9th century but was often ruled by the same count as Thurgau. In 915, Z\u00fcrichgau together with Thurgau fell to the [[Bucharding]] [[dukes of Swabia]]. In the late 10th century, the county of Z\u00fcrich was ruled by the [[Nellenburg]]er, and during 1077\u20131172 by the [[counts of Lenzburg|Lenzburger]].\nBy the 13th century, Z\u00fcrichgau was divided between the [[Habsburgs]] and the [[House of Kyburg|Kyburger]], who held the territory west and east of Lake Z\u00fcrich, respectively.<ref>{{HLS|8573|Z\u00fcrichgau|author=Peter Erhart|date=2014}}\n</ref>\n\n===City state===\n{{see|Republic of Z\u00fcrich|Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n[[File:Verwaltung Kanton Z\u00fcrich 17.png|thumb|Administrative division of the Z\u00fcrichgau in the 18th century.]]\nThe territory of the canton of Z\u00fcrich corresponds to the lands acquired by the city of Z\u00fcrich after it became ''[[reichsfrei]]'' in 1218. Z\u00fcrich pursued a policy of aggressive territorial expansion especially during the century following the revolution of the [[Guilds of Z\u00fcrich|guild]]s in 1336. \nZ\u00fcrich joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] in 1351.\n \nZ\u00fcrich claimed and lost the [[Toggenburg]] in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of the 1440s. The northern parts up to the river [[Rhine]] came to the canton after the city of Z\u00fcrich purchased [[Winterthur]] from the [[Habsburgs]] in 1468. \nIn 1651, Z\u00fcrich purchased [[Rafz]]erfeld from the counts of [[Sulz am Neckar|Sulz]]. At this point, almost all of the territory of the modern canton (as well as some territories beyond its modern borders) was owned by Z\u00fcrich; exceptions include [[W\u00fclflingen]] (acquired 1760), [[Buch am Irchel|Buch]] (acquired 1761), \n[[Dietikon]], which was a [[Old Swiss Confederacy#Condominiums|condominium]], and [[Rheinau, Switzerland|Rheinau]] (owned by [[Rheinau Abbey]]).\n\nIn the 18th century, the \"inner bailiwicks\" (''Innere Vogteien'') were under direct administration of city officials, while the \"outer bailiwicks\" (''\u00c4ussere Vogteien'') were ruled by the [[Landvogt|reeves]] of [[county of Kyburg|Kyburg]], [[Gr\u00fcningen]], [[Greifensee, Z\u00fcrich#History|Greifensee]], [[Eglisau]], [[Regensberg]], [[Andelfingen, Switzerland|Andelfingen]], [[W\u00e4denswil]], and [[Knonauer Amt|Knonau]]. The city of [[Winterthur]] was nominally subject to Z\u00fcrich but retained far-reaching autonomy.\n\n''Z\u00fcrichgau'', the name of the medieval ''pagus'', was in use for the territories of the city of Z\u00fcrich during the 15th and 16th century; the term ''canton'' (''Kanton'') gradually entered use in the 16th century, but ''Z\u00fcrichgau'' remained widely used well into the 19th century (becoming obsolescent after the formation of the modern canton in 1831).\n\nUnder the short-lived [[Helvetic Republic]] (1798\u20131803), the ''canton of Z\u00fcrich'' became a purely administrative division. In 1803, some former possessions of Z\u00fcrich to the west gained independence as part of the [[Canton of Aargau]].\nIn 1804 the [[Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich]] was established as ''Landj\u00e4ger-Corps des Kantons Z\u00fcrich''.<ref name=\"hds-polizei\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9638.php|title=Polizei|publisher=HDS|author=Christoph Ebn\u00f6ther|language=German|date=2010-09-28|accessdate=2015-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Modern canton===\nA cantonal constitution was drawn up in 1814 and replaced in 1831 by a [[Radicalism (historical)|radical-liberal]] constitution.\nThe [[Z\u00fcriputsch]], an armed uprising of the conservative rural population against the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|radical-liberal order]], led to the dissolution of the cantonal government, and a provisional conservative government was installed by colonel Paul Carl Eduard Ziegler.\nUnder the threat of intervention of the other radical-liberal cantons of the Confederacy, the provisional government declared that the 1831 constitution would remain in effect. In a tumultuous session on 9 September 1839, the cantonal parliament declared its dissolution \nIn the so-called ''Septemberregime'', the newly elected cantonal government replaced all cantonal officials with conservatives, but it was again ousted by a radical-liberal election victory in 1844.\n\n[[Alfred Escher]] was a member of the new cantonal parliament of 1844; he was elected to the cantonal government in 1848 and later in the same year into the first [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] under the new [[Swiss constitution|federal constitution]]. \nThe radical-liberal era of 1844\u20131868 was dominated by the so-called ''System Escher'', a network of liberal politicians and industrialists built by Alfred Escher. Escher governed the canton almost in monarchical fashion, and was popularly dubbed ''Alfred I.'' or ''Tsar of All Z\u00fcrich''. Escher controlled all cantonal institutions, at first with very little political opposition, expunging all trace of the conservative takeover of 1839. Under Escher, the city of Z\u00fcrich rose to the status of economic and financial center it still retains.\nOpposition against the dominance of ''Sytstem Escher'' increased after 1863. The cantonal government was accused to continue the system of aristocratic rule liberalism had claimed to abolish. The oppositional ''Democratic Movement'' was centered in [[Winterthur]], led by mayor Johann Jakob Sulzer and publicist Salomon Bleuler. They succeeded in imposing the introduction of the [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] instrument of the [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]] in 1865, which precipitated a revision of the cantonal constitution.\nIn April 1869, a new cantonal constitution was adopted by popular vote, introducing additional direct democratic elements and the popular election of both the cantonal government and the cantonal representatives in the federal [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]]. \nThe new constitution also abolished the [[death penalty]] (the last execution by hanging in Z\u00fcrich took place in 1810, the last public execution by guillotine in 1865), guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of association]] and introduced [[progressive tax]]es.\n\nThe [[Zurich Cantonal Bank|Cantonal Bank]] was established in 1870 to regulate cantonal loans at fixed interest rates to farms and businesses.\n\nA law of [[proportional representation]] was passed in 1916, favouring the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]]. \nA proposal for the introduction of female suffrage was rejected in 1920; female suffrage was introduced on the municipal level in 1969 and on the cantonal level in 1970, shortly before its imposition by federal law, passed in 1971.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 20th century. A first airport was built at [[D\u00fcbendorf]] in 1910, replaced by the [[Zurich Airport|international airport]] at [[Kloten]] in 1948. Rapid [[Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area|urbanisation]] expanded throughout the canton and beyond in the final decades of the 20th century, further accelerated by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] from 1990, with only a few municipalities in [[Z\u00fcrcher Weinland|Weinland]], [[Affoltern District|Knonaueramt]] and [[Z\u00fcrcher Oberland|Oberland]] remaining out of [[Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area|easy commuting distance]] to the city.\n\nThe current constitution replaced the one of 1869 in January 2006.\n\nThe [[Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Z\u00fcrich]] is an organization devoted to preserving the canton's history, the [[Staatsarchiv Z\u00fcrich]] houses the state archives.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Z\u00fcrichsee.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] and the island of [[Ufenau]], the largest in Switzerland]]\nThe canton of Z\u00fcrich is situated in the eastern part of the [[Swiss plateau]]. It is entirely within the drainage basin of the [[High Rhine]].\nIt is characterized by [[Glacial landform]] and traversed by a series of rivers generally flowing south-east to north-west, listed west to east: [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], [[Reppisch]], [[Sihl (river)|Sihl]], [[Linth]]-[[Limmat]] (forming [[Lake Z\u00fcrich]]), [[Glatt (Rhine)|Glatt]], [[T\u00f6ss (river)|T\u00f6ss]] and [[Thur (Rhine)|Thur]]. The main lakes are the [[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] (Linth-Limmat, 88&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), [[Greifensee]] (Glatt, 8.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Pf\u00e4ffikersee]] (Glatt, 3.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\nMinor lakes include [[T\u00fcrlersee]] (Limmat), [[Katzensee]] (Glatt), [[H\u00fcttnersee]] (Sihl), [[L\u00fctzelsee]] (Limmat).\n\nIts neighbouring cantons are [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] to the north, [[Aargau]] to the west, the cantons of [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] to the south and the cantons of [[Thurgau]] and [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] to the east.\n\nIt also has an international border with the German district of [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]] and though only for {{convert|460|m|ft|abbr=on}}) the district of [[Constance (district)|Konstanz]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] owing to its short border with [[Stemmer, Germany|Stemmer]], an outlying hamlet belonging to the municipality which forms the small German [[enclave]] of [[B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein]].\n\nThe canton can be roughly divided into the city and lake, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Unterland|Unterland]] in the northwest, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Oberland|Oberland]] in the southeast, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Weinland|Weinland]] and [[Winterthur]] in the northeast, and the [[Knonaueramt]] southwest of the Albis. The [[Greater Z\u00fcrich Area]] extends beyond the cantonal borders.\n\nThe canton has an area, {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, of {{convert|1728.8|km2|mi2|sp=us}}. Of this area, 43.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 30.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and 5.8% is unproductive land.<ref name=SFSO/>\n\nMost of the canton consists of shallow river valleys which drain towards the [[High Rhine]] to the north. [[Rafz]]erfeld is a territory north of the Rhine acquired by the canton in 1651.\nIn the northwest and southeast of the canton the territory rises towards the [[Jura mountains|Jura]] and [[Swiss Alps|Alps]], respectively. The valley of the [[Linth]] leads into the Lake Z\u00fcrich and continues as the [[Limmat]]. This valley is the most significant valley of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. \nThe valley of the [[Glatt (river)|Glatt]] originates in the Greifensee and is separated from the Limmat by ridges. The valley of the [[T\u00f6ss (river)|T\u00f6ss]] is gorge-like. It is located in the east of the canton and is separated from the [[Toggenburg (Switzerland)|Toggenburg]] area in the [[canton of St. Gallen]] by a mountainous area.\n\nThe ''H\u00f6rnli'' (1133 m) is the highest elevation of this mountain ridge. The valley of the river [[Sihl]] is located in the west of the canton. In confluences with the [[Limmat]] in the city of Z\u00fcrich. The Sihl is separated from the lake of Z\u00fcrich by the ''[[Albis]] Range''. The ''Albishorn'' ({{convert|915|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is the highest elevation of this range. \nThe Schnebelhorn is a mountain located near Fischenthal in the T\u00f6ss Valley, between the cantons of Z\u00fcrich (west) and St. Gallen (east). It is the highest summit ({{convert|1,292|m|ft|abbr=on}}) of the canton of Z\u00fcrich.\nThe ''[[Uetliberg]]'' is part of the Albis Range.

A county of Z\u00fcrichgau was established under [[Louis the Pious]], for a count Ruadker, in 820. Z\u00fcrichgau (''Zurichgeuue'') remained a nominally separate territory in the later 9th century but was often ruled by the same count as Thurgau. In 915, Z\u00fcrichgau together with Thurgau fell to the [[Bucharding]] [[dukes of Swabia]]. In the late 10th century, the county of Z\u00fcrich was ruled by the [[Nellenburg]]er, and during 1077\u20131172 by the [[counts of Lenzburg|Lenzburger]].\nBy the 13th century, Z\u00fcrichgau was divided between the [[Habsburgs]] and the [[House of Kyburg|Kyburger]], who held the territory west and east of Lake Z\u00fcrich, respectively.<ref>{{HLS|8573|Z\u00fcrichgau|author=Peter Erhart|date=2014}}\n</ref>\n\n===City state===\n{{see|Republic of Z\u00fcrich|Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n[[File:Verwaltung Kanton Z\u00fcrich 17.png|thumb|Administrative division of the Z\u00fcrichgau in the 18th century.]]\nThe territory of the canton of Z\u00fcrich corresponds to the lands acquired by the city of Z\u00fcrich after it became ''[[reichsfrei]]'' in 1218. Z\u00fcrich pursued a policy of aggressive territorial expansion especially during the century following the revolution of the [[Guilds of Z\u00fcrich|guild]]s in 1336. \nZ\u00fcrich joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] in 1351.\n \nZ\u00fcrich claimed and lost the [[Toggenburg]] in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of the 1440s. The northern parts up to the river [[Rhine]] came to the canton after the city of Z\u00fcrich purchased [[Winterthur]] from the [[Habsburgs]] in 1468. \nIn 1651, Z\u00fcrich purchased [[Rafz]]erfeld from the counts of [[Sulz am Neckar|Sulz]]. At this point, almost all of the territory of the modern canton (as well as some territories beyond its modern borders) was owned by Z\u00fcrich; exceptions include [[W\u00fclflingen]] (acquired 1760), [[Buch am Irchel|Buch]] (acquired 1761), \n[[Dietikon]], which was a [[Old Swiss Confederacy#Condominiums|condominium]], and [[Rheinau, Switzerland|Rheinau]] (owned by [[Rheinau Abbey]]).\n\nIn the 18th century, the \"inner bailiwicks\" (''Innere Vogteien'') were under direct administration of city officials, while the \"outer bailiwicks\" (''\u00c4ussere Vogteien'') were ruled by the [[Landvogt|reeves]] of [[county of Kyburg|Kyburg]], [[Gr\u00fcningen]], [[Greifensee, Z\u00fcrich#History|Greifensee]], [[Eglisau]], [[Regensberg]], [[Andelfingen, Switzerland|Andelfingen]], [[W\u00e4denswil]], and [[Knonauer Amt|Knonau]]. The city of [[Winterthur]] was nominally subject to Z\u00fcrich but retained far-reaching autonomy.\n\n''Z\u00fcrichgau'', the name of the medieval ''pagus'', was in use for the territories of the city of Z\u00fcrich during the 15th and 16th century; the term ''canton'' (''Kanton'') gradually entered use in the 16th century, but ''Z\u00fcrichgau'' remained widely used well into the 19th century (becoming obsolescent after the formation of the modern canton in 1831).\n\nUnder the short-lived [[Helvetic Republic]] (1798\u20131803), the ''canton of Z\u00fcrich'' became a purely administrative division. In 1803, some former possessions of Z\u00fcrich to the west gained independence as part of the [[Canton of Aargau]].\nIn 1804 the [[Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich]] was established as ''Landj\u00e4ger-Corps des Kantons Z\u00fcrich''.<ref name=\"hds-polizei\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9638.php|title=Polizei|publisher=HDS|author=Christoph Ebn\u00f6ther|language=German|date=2010-09-28|accessdate=2015-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Modern canton===\nA cantonal constitution was drawn up in 1814 and replaced in 1831 by a [[Radicalism (historical)|radical-liberal]] constitution.\nThe [[Z\u00fcriputsch]], an armed uprising of the conservative rural population against the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|radical-liberal order]], led to the dissolution of the cantonal government, and a provisional conservative government was installed by colonel Paul Carl Eduard Ziegler.\nUnder the threat of intervention of the other radical-liberal cantons of the Confederacy, the provisional government declared that the 1831 constitution would remain in effect. In a tumultuous session on 9 September 1839, the cantonal parliament declared its dissolution \nIn the so-called ''Septemberregime'', the newly elected cantonal government replaced all cantonal officials with conservatives, but it was again ousted by a radical-liberal election victory in 1844.\n\n[[Alfred Escher]] was a member of the new cantonal parliament of 1844; he was elected to the cantonal government in 1848 and later in the same year into the first [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] under the new [[Swiss constitution|federal constitution]]. \nThe radical-liberal era of 1844\u20131868 was dominated by the so-called ''System Escher'', a network of liberal politicians and industrialists built by Alfred Escher. Escher governed the canton almost in monarchical fashion, and was popularly dubbed ''Alfred I.'' or ''Tsar of All Z\u00fcrich''. Escher controlled all cantonal institutions, at first with very little political opposition, expunging all trace of the conservative takeover of 1839. Under Escher, the city of Z\u00fcrich rose to the status of economic and financial center it still retains.\nOpposition against the dominance of ''Sytstem Escher'' increased after 1863. The cantonal government was accused to continue the system of aristocratic rule liberalism had claimed to abolish. The oppositional ''Democratic Movement'' was centered in [[Winterthur]], led by mayor Johann Jakob Sulzer and publicist Salomon Bleuler. They succeeded in imposing the introduction of the [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] instrument of the [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]] in 1865, which precipitated a revision of the cantonal constitution.\nIn April 1869, a new cantonal constitution was adopted by popular vote, introducing additional direct democratic elements and the popular election of both the cantonal government and the cantonal representatives in the federal [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]]. \nThe new constitution also abolished the [[death penalty]] (the last execution by hanging in Z\u00fcrich took place in 1810, the last public execution by guillotine in 1865), guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of association]] and introduced [[progressive tax]]es.\n\nThe [[Zurich Cantonal Bank|Cantonal Bank]] was established in 1870 to regulate cantonal loans at fixed interest rates to farms and businesses.\n\nA law of [[proportional representation]] was passed in 1916, favouring the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]]. \nA proposal for the introduction of female suffrage was rejected in 1920; female suffrage was introduced on the municipal level in 1969 and on the cantonal level in 1970, shortly before its imposition by federal law, passed in 1971.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 20th century. A first airport was built at [[D\u00fcbendorf]] in 1910, replaced by the [[Zurich Airport|international airport]] at [[Kloten]] in 1948. Rapid [[Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area|urbanisation]] expanded throughout the canton and beyond in the final decades of the 20th century, further accelerated by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] from 1990, with only a few municipalities in [[Z\u00fcrcher Weinland|Weinland]], [[Affoltern District|Knonaueramt]] and [[Z\u00fcrcher Oberland|Oberland]] remaining out of [[Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area|easy commuting distance]] to the city.\n\nThe current constitution replaced the one of 1869 in January 2006.\n\nThe [[Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Z\u00fcrich]] is an organization devoted to preserving the canton's history, the [[Staatsarchiv Z\u00fcrich]] houses the state archives.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Z\u00fcrichsee.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] and the island of [[Ufenau]], the largest in Switzerland]]\nThe canton of Z\u00fcrich is situated in the eastern part of the [[Swiss plateau]].

Here Davison was apprenticed to the printing trade, and first started writing.\n\nBetween 1909 and the beginning of World War I, he travelled widely in North America and the [[West Indies]]. However, with the beginning of the war, he went to England and enlisted, serving in France with the British cavalry. He met his wife Agnes (who was known as Kay) Ede in England while he was doing officer training at [[Aldershot]] and they married in 1915. They had a son and a daughter. Davison and his family came to Australia in 1919 after the war ended, and took up a [[Soldier settlement (Australia)|Soldier Settlement]] selection near [[Injune]], Queensland.

Here Davison was apprenticed to the printing trade, and first started writing.\n\nBetween 1909 and the beginning of World War I, he travelled widely in North America and the [[West Indies]]. However, with the beginning of the war, he went to England and enlisted, serving in France with the British cavalry. He met his wife Agnes (who was known as Kay) Ede in England while he was doing officer training at [[Aldershot]] and they married in 1915. They had a son and a daughter. Davison and his family came to Australia in 1919 after the war ended, and took up a [[Soldier settlement (Australia)|Soldier Settlement]] selection near [[Injune]], Queensland. However, the farm failed, and, in 1923, he and his family moved to Sydney where he worked in real estate and as an advertising manager for his father's magazines, the ''Australian'' and ''Australia''.<ref name = \"OCAL\"/><ref name = \"Ms\">''Papers of Frank Dalby Davison''</ref>\n\nHe had a romantic relationship with fellow writer, [[Marjorie Barnard]], through the late 1930s.<ref name = \"Modjeska\">Modjeska (1991) pp. 208\u2013210</ref> Barnard used an inversion of his name \"Knarf\" for the hero of her [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow''.\n\nDuring World War II, he worked in government departments in Sydney and Melbourne.<ref name = \"Smith 172\"/>\n\nHis marriage, which had been failing for some time, was dissolved, and in 1944 he married Edna Marie McNab.<ref name = \"Ms\"/> In 1951, they bought a farm called \"Folding Hills\" at Arthur's Creek (Victoria).<ref name = \"OCAL\"/> He wrote his last major work, ''The White Thorntree'' (1968), here.\n\nDavison died in Melbourne on 24 May 1970.\n\n==Writing career==\n\nDavison began writing full-time during the depression, adopting, at this time, the names Frank Dalby to distinguish himself from his father.<ref name = \"OCAL\" /> He won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for his novel ''Man-shy'' in 1931.\n\n''Man-shy'' is \"the story of a red heifer ... who learned to value freedom above everything\".<ref name = \"Smith 171\">Smith (1980) p. 171</ref> It was initially published in serial form in 1923\u201325 in his father's ''Australian'' magazine.<ref name = \"Smith 171\"/> Later, with the [[Great Depression|Depression]] impacting his earning ability, he tried to find a publisher. However, no-one was interested in a book \"about a cow\", so he published it himself. Angus & Robertson took it on after it won the Australian Literature Society's award.<ref name = \"Smith 171\"/>\n\nDuring the 1930s he worked as a real-estate agent and also as a special contributor to ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]''. He produced several stories and books, including the novel ''Children of the Dark People'' and the short story collection ''The Woman at the Mill''.<ref name = \"Smith 172\"/>\n\nWhile ''Man-shy'' took over 7 years to be published, his last book, ''The White Thorntree'', took over 22 years to write.<ref name = \"Smith 171\"/> Smith wrote in 1980 that it \"deals with human beings and their sexual expressions of themselves as no other Australian writer has done\".<ref name = \"Smith 171\"/> The first edition was published with a cover designed by artist and friend, [[Clifton Pugh]].<ref name = \"Smith 175\">Smith (1980) p. 175</ref>\n\nDavison was active in the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] and, through the 1930s, formed a close working relationship with [[Marjorie Barnard]] and [[Flora Eldershaw]]. Barnard, Eldershaw and Davison were known as the \"triumvirate\" for their work in developing progressive policies through the Fellowship on such issues as civil liberties and censorship.<ref name = \"OCAL\"/> In the Acknowledgment for ''Dusty'' (1946) he wrote:\n<blockquote>A few years ago I was granted a year's Fellowship by the Commonwealth Literary Fund to carry out certain work. This is the first opportunity I have had to make suitable acknowledgments. I am hoping this book will be accepted as completing the undertaking of which the volume of short stories, ''The Woman at The Mill'', was the first part. This is not the novel I had in mind \u2013 perhaps it is a better one! \u2013 but it accrues from that year in which I had free time to work and grow, and for which I am grateful to my fellow citizens and the community of letters.<ref>Davison (1946) ''Acknowledgment</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe was also a long-time friend of [[Vance Palmer|Vance]] and [[Nettie Palmer]]<ref name = \"Smith 173\"/> and [[John Morrison (writer)|John Morrison]].<ref>Morrison, pp.55-61.</ref>\n\nDavison wrote under several pseudonyms:  T Bone; The Roo; Davison, Fred D.; Fred Davison, Junr; Fred Junr; Davison, F.

He attended a number of primary schools in his childhood before attending and graduating from Miami State High School.  After leaving school McDermott worked blue collar or semi-skilled jobs including as a jackeroo in central Queensland and north-western NSW, a barman in the Whitsundays, and an office clerk in Brisbane.\n\nHe moved to Armidale, NSW, at 19, to attend The University of New England and studied for a BA in Politics and Economic History.  He became active in student politics, being elected as President of the UNE Students Association and Representative Council in 1989. He continued his study part-time while working full-time and moved to Sydney, where he became involved with the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party.\n\n== Military service ==\nMcDermott joined the Australian Defence Force (Army General Reserve) as a soldier, before being promoted as a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). He was at one time selected to attend the Army's Officer Cadet Training Program (Sydney University Regiment/Royal Military College Duntroon) and received a Probationary Commission (Reserve Forces - Infantry).  McDermott's military service included serving as a Forward Observer Signalman with 41 Battery, 5/11 Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery; an M113A1 Armoured Vehicle Driver and crew commander with A Squadron, 12/16 Hunter River Lancers, Royal Australian Armoured Corps; and as an NCO and Officer Cadet with the Sydney University Regiment, Royal Australian Infantry Corps. He also spent periods of time posted to full-time duty with the Australian Regular Army.  McDermott was awarded the Australian Defence Medal (ADM) for his military service.{{citation needed|reason=Previous reference was to LinkedIn which is not an independent source|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Activism within the Labour Movement ==\n\nMcDermott states that he holds a strong belief in Catholic social teachings.  He admires those who do not simply talk about their beliefs, but put those beliefs into pragmatic action and help their community.  As such he considered joining the priesthood. In his inaugural speech, McDermott spoke about his admiration for the example of Jesuits and religious members who stood up and were counted to help the vulnerable and fight oppression - especially their political opposition to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"McDermott inaugural\">{{cite Hansard |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/member/files/129/Hugh%20McDermott%20Inaugural%20Speech.pdf |title=Inaugural speech |speaker=Hugh McDermott |jurisdiction=NSW |house=Legislative Assembly |date=13 May 2015 |access-date=7 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nUpon moving to Sydney in 1992 McDermott took up a position with the Catholic Industrial Office within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney. It was there where he met [[John Ducker]], who had a profound effect on the path of his career and life. Ducker, Chairman of the Catholic Industrial Affairs Committee, was a former NSW Labour Council Secretary and Minister in the Wran Labor Government. He believed that to be a Catholic, and to believe in Catholic social teachings, one must put that belief into action.<ref name=\"McDermott inaugural\"/>\n\nDucker introduced  McDermott to Laurie Short, who became his role model as a great Labour leader.  Short was the former National Secretary of the [[Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia]] (FIA).  Short led the fight against Stalinist-communist factions that had infilrated the trade union movement and the Australia Labor Party.

He attended a number of primary schools in his childhood before attending and graduating from Miami State High School.  After leaving school McDermott worked blue collar or semi-skilled jobs including as a jackeroo in central Queensland and north-western NSW, a barman in the Whitsundays, and an office clerk in Brisbane.\n\nHe moved to Armidale, NSW, at 19, to attend The University of New England and studied for a BA in Politics and Economic History.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time.\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking 30 years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time.\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Pages 17 & 19.</ref> He was the third son of the couple's five children, the others being Russell (1911\u20132002), Ayde Geoffrey (1914\u2013 ), Lloyd (1918\u20132011), and Clive (1923\u20132009).<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 21, 24 & 26.</ref> When Brickhill was 11 the family moved to Sydney, where he was educated at [[North Sydney Boys High School]]. A classmate, and friend, was actor [[Peter Finch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/north-shore/his-great-escape-how-famous-author-paul-brickhill-ended-his-days-in-a-small-sydney-flat/news-story/8c2af4c28654cf56bc535d18b68ea3d0|title=Great Escape author\u2019s mystery life|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nBrickhill left school in 1931 as his father had been made redundant as a result of the Depression. While his other brothers continued with their education it was necessary for Brickhill, who was regarded as the least academic of the children, to get a job to assist his older brother Russell in bringing money into the family.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 37.</ref> He was sacked from his first two jobs due to his stutter. He then got a job as office boy and then lift boy at the Adelaide Steamship Company. That job did not last long, as Peter Finch, who was by now working as a copy boy, was able to convince a news editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]''  to interview Brickhill in 1932.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 39.</ref> Brickhill was hired as a copy boy, and within a year was promoted to cadet journalist. Within a few years he had worked his way up to journalist, and by 1940 was a sub-editor.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 47.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nBrickhill was initially unimpressed by war fever, until the shock of the invasion of France and subsequent withdrawal from Dunkirk, coupled with boredom with his deskbound sub-editor job, caused him to enlist on 6 January 1941 with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 49.</ref>\nHis flight training commenced in March 1941 at the Number 8 Elementary Flying Training School at Narrandera, New South Wales as undertaken in Australia \nUnder the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Brickhill undertook advanced training as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in Canada and the United Kingdom before being assigned to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]], a unit equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s and part of the [[Desert Air Force]] in North Africa. \n\nOn 17 March 1943, he was shot down over [[Tunisia]] and became a [[prisoner of war]].<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 1 to 12.</ref> He was flown to Italy on 23 March, then sent by train to Germany. After initially being held at the [[Dulag Luft]] at [[Oberursel (Taunus) | Oberursel]], a central receiving and interrogation station for captured enemy airman for the [[Luftwaffe]], he was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], in [[Lower Silesia]], 150 km southeast of Berlin, arriving there on 4 April 1943.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 84 to 85.</ref>\nBrickhill became involved with organizing the camp's escape, initially as a lookout or \"stoogie\", before volunteering to work as a digger on the \"Tom\" tunnel\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 102 to 105.</ref> He developed [[claustrophobia]], and as a result was eventually reassigned and put in charge of security for the forgers. Because of his claustrophobia and the risk that he would panic and block the escape of others behind him, he was not allowed to take part in the [[Stalag Luft III escape|mass escape attempt]], which is known as \"The Great Escape\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 124.</ref>\n\nFollowing the announcement of the murder of the escapees who had been recaptured following the Great Escape, Brickhill became determined to document the event. Discussing the subject with fellow prisoner Conrad Norton, they identified that many of their fellow prisoners had other tales of daring escapes, and that they could provide the possibility of publishing a book following the end of the war. As Brickhill had been involved in \"The Great Escape\", he concentrated on that story, while Norton collected individual tales.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 138.</ref> As prisoners were forbidden from writing anything other than letters and postcards, they collected every piece of paper they could find and, writing in as small a hand as possible, they collected stories and hid them from the guards. \n\nOn [[D-Day]], while still in captivity, Brickhill heard on German radio of two huge Allied armadas heading towards [[Cap d'Antifer]] and [[Calais]].  These were diversions created by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] to fool the Germans, however, a fact he learned months later.\n\n==Return to journalism==\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the terms of his enlistment with the RAAF had been that he had to serve for 12 months following the cessation of hostilities, Brickhill was granted six months' leave without pay. During his leave he returned to journalism, working as a London-based correspondent for [[Associated Newspapers]]. Meanwhile, outside of working hours he had typed up his and Norton's stories and selected David Higham as their literary agent.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 162.</ref> With Higham's help the manuscript was accepted by [[Faber & Faber]] and published as ''Escape to Danger'' in 1946.\n\nAfter working for Associated Newspapers for a period, Brickhill returned to Australia, taking a job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in Sydney, Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 194.</ref>\n\nBrickhill and Norton had agreed that each would retain the copyright to the chapters that they had written for ''Escape to Danger''. As a result, while awaiting for sufficient stocks of paper to be obtained to print the book, Brickhill was able to sell a condensed version of his chapter on the Great Escape to several newspapers in Australia.\n\n==The Great Escape and The Dam Busters==\nAfter the end of World War II, John Nerney, head of the [[Air Historical Branch]] of the [[British Air Ministry]] identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. While trying to find a suitable author he discussed the issue with [[John Pudney]], who was an editor at ''[[News Review]]''. Pudney had liked ''Escape to Danger'' and suggested that Brickhill be considered.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provide Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 197.</ref> In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None was interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.<ref name=Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n \nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher [[Evans Brothers]] as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198/>\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 199.</ref>\n\nOnce in England Brickhill asked the RAF about the status of the proposed history of 617 squadron, offering his services if they were still required. As the RAF had made no further progress in finding an alternative author, his offer was accepted.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 200.</ref>\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the proposed book on 617 Squadron, but they were not interested in providing any advance until they saw a manuscript.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 206.</ref> \nAlready working on ''The Great Escape'', Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on the 617 squadron history.\n\n''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]'' was published in 1950 and brought the incident to wide public attention. \n\nThe history of 617 Squadron and in particular its involvement in [[Operation Chastise|Operation ''Chastise'']] and the destruction of dams in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley was published in 1951 as ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', which sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 233.</ref><ref name= RamsdenP20 >Ramsden. Page 20.</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Dam Busters'' [[Robert Clark (film executive)|Robert Clark]] the head of production at [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] approached Brickhill about acquiring the screen rights to the book. The company's production manager was of the opinion that there were too many people and raids involved, and that they would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result, he requested that Brickhill provide a condensed film treatment. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the screen rights. To assist, Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's Director of Production.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 237.</ref>  Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on [[Operation Chastise]], and ignore the later raids.\n\nAssociated agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been \u20a45,000.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 241.</ref>\n\nThe subsequent film was released in 1954 as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.\n\n==''Reach for the Sky''==\nAfter reading ''The Dam Busters'', [[Battle of Britain]] ace [[Douglas Bader]] approached Brickhill in 1951 about collaborating on his biography.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 233 to 236.</ref> Brickhill agreed to undertake the project.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 239.</ref>\n\nAfter approaching several publishers about the proposed biography Brickhill's agent found that William Collins and Sons were prepared to offer the best terms, leading Brickhill to sign with them. However Brickhill felt guilty about not signing with John Pudney and Evans Brothers, who had previously been so supportive of him.  He consequently offered to write an anthology of escape stories for them, which they eventually published as ''Escape \u2013 Or Die''.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 240.</ref>\n\nThe resulting biography of Bader was published in 1954 as ''Reach for the Sky''. In the first few months alone, 172,000 copies were sold.<ref>Mackenzie. Page 164.</ref> The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain.\n\nThe book was subsequently adapted for the screen and released in 1956 as a [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|feature film]]. Starring [[Kenneth More]] as Bader, it topped the box office in Britain that year.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 303 to304.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBrickhill spent the rest of his life working on several unfinished film screenplays, novels and biographies, but was never able to repeat his successes of 1949 to 1954.\n\nIn 1969 he returned to live permanently in Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 355.</ref> Brickhill died in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] on 23 April 1991 aged 74.<ref name=ADB>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brickhill-paul-chester-14647 |title=Brickhill, Paul Chester (1916\u20131991) |first=Craig|last=Wilcox|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref> See also John Ramsland's update.<ref>John A Ramsland.

Pages 17 & 19.</ref> He was the third son of the couple's five children, the others being Russell (1911\u20132002), Ayde Geoffrey (1914\u2013 ), Lloyd (1918\u20132011), and Clive (1923\u20132009).<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 21, 24 & 26.</ref> When Brickhill was 11 the family moved to Sydney where he was educated at [[North Sydney Boys High School]]. A classmate, and friend, was actor [[Peter Finch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/north-shore/his-great-escape-how-famous-author-paul-brickhill-ended-his-days-in-a-small-sydney-flat/news-story/8c2af4c28654cf56bc535d18b68ea3d0|title=Great Escape author\u2019s mystery life|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nBrickhill left school in 1931 as his father had been made redundant as a result of the Depression. While his other brothers continued with their education it was necessary for Brickhill, who was regarded as the least academic of the children, to get a job to assist his older brother Russell in bringing money into the family.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 37.</ref> He was sacked from his first two jobs due to his stutter. He then got a job as office boy and then lift boy at the Adelaide Steamship Company. That job did not last long, as Peter Finch, who was by now working as a copy boy, was able to convince a news editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]''  to interview Brickhill in 1932.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 39.</ref> Brickhill was hired as a copy boy, and within a year was promoted to cadet journalist. Within a few years he had worked his way up to journalist, and by 1940 was a sub-editor.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 47.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nBrickhill was initially unimpressed by war fever, until the shock of the invasion of France and subsequent withdrawal from Dunkirk, coupled with boredom with his deskbound sub-editor job, caused him to enlist on 6 January 1941 with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 49.</ref>\nHis flight training commenced in March 1941 at the Number 8 Elementary Flying Training School at Narrandera, New South Wales as undertaken in Australia \nUnder the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Brickhill undertook advanced training as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in Canada and the United Kingdom before being assigned to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]], a unit equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s and part of the [[Desert Air Force]] in North Africa. \n\nOn 17 March 1943, he was shot down over [[Tunisia]] and became a [[prisoner of war]].<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 1 to 12.</ref> He was flown to Italy on 23 March, then sent by train to Germany. After initially being held at the [[Dulag Luft]] at [[Oberursel (Taunus) | Oberursel]], a central receiving and interrogation station for captured enemy airman for the [[Luftwaffe]], he was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], in [[Lower Silesia]], 150 km southeast of Berlin, arriving there on 4 April 1943.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 84 to 85.</ref>\nBrickhill became involved with organizing the camp's escape, initially as a lookout or \"stoogie\", before volunteering to work as a digger on the \"Tom\" tunnel\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 102 to 105.</ref> He developed [[claustrophobia]], and as a result was eventually reassigned and put in charge of security for the forgers. Because of his claustrophobia and the risk that he would panic and block the escape of others behind him, he was not allowed to take part in the [[Stalag Luft III escape|mass escape attempt]], which is known as \"The Great Escape\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 124.</ref>\n\nFollowing the announcement of the murder of the escapees who had been recaptured following the Great Escape, Brickhill became determined to document the event. Discussing the subject with fellow prisoner Conrad Norton, they identified that many of their fellow prisoners had other tales of daring escapes, and that they could provide the possibility of publishing a book following the end of the war. As Brickhill had been involved in \"The Great Escape\", he concentrated on that story, while Norton collected individual tales.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 138.</ref> As prisoners were forbidden from writing anything other than letters and postcards, they collected every piece of paper they could find and, writing in as small a hand as possible, they collected stories and hid them from the guards. \n\nOn [[D-Day]], while still in captivity, Brickhill heard on German radio of two huge Allied armadas heading towards [[Cap d'Antifer]] and [[Calais]].  These were diversions created by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] to fool the Germans, however, a fact he learned months later.\n\n==Return to journalism==\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the terms of his enlistment with the RAAF had been that he had to serve for 12 months following the cessation of hostilities, Brickhill was granted six months' leave without pay. During his leave he returned to journalism, working as a London-based correspondent for [[Associated Newspapers]]. Meanwhile outside of working hours he had typed up his and Norton's stories and selected David Higham as their literary agent.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 162.</ref> With Higham's help the manuscript was accepted by [[Faber & Faber]] and published as ''Escape to Danger'' in 1946.\n\nAfter working for Associated Newspapers for a period, Brickhill returned to Australia, taking a job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in Sydney, Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 194.</ref>\n\nBrickhill and Norton had agreed that each would retain the copyright to the chapters that they had written for ''Escape to Danger''. As a result while awaiting for sufficient stocks of paper to be obtained to print the book, Brickhill was able to sell a condensed version of his chapter on the Great Escape to several newspapers in Australia.\n\n==The Great Escape and The Dam Busters==\nAfter the end of World War II, John Nerney, head of the [[Air Historical Branch]] of the [[British Air Ministry]] identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. While trying to find a suitable author he discussed the issue with [[John Pudney]], who was an editor at ''[[News Review]]''. Pudney had liked ''Escape to Danger'' and suggested that Brickhill be considered.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provide Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 197.</ref> In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None was interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.<ref name=Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n \nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher [[Evans Brothers]] as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198/>\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 199.</ref>\n\nOnce in England Brickhill asked the RAF about the status of the proposed history of 617 squadron, offering his services if they were still required. As the RAF had made no further progress in finding an alternative author, his offer was accepted.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 200.</ref>\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the proposed book on 617 Squadron, but they were not interested in providing any advance until they saw a manuscript.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 206.</ref> \nAlready working on ''The Great Escape'', Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on the 617 squadron history.\n\n''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]'' was published in 1950 and brought the incident to wide public attention. \n\nThe history of 617 Squadron and in particular its involvement in [[Operation Chastise|Operation ''Chastise'']] and the destruction of dams in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley was published in 1951 as ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', which sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 233.</ref><ref name= RamsdenP20 >Ramsden. Page 20.</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Dam Busters'' [[Robert Clark (film executive)|Robert Clark]] the head of production at [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] approached Brickhill about acquiring the screen rights to the book. The company's production manager was of the opinion that there were too many people and raids involved, and that they would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result he requested that Brickhill provide a condensed film treatment. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the screen rights. To assist , Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's Director of Production.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 237.</ref>  Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on [[Operation Chastise]], and ignore the later raids.\n\nAssociated agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been \u20a45,000.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 241.</ref>\n\nThe subsequent film was released in 1954 as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.\n\n==''Reach for the Sky''==\nAfter reading ''The Dam Busters'', [[Battle of Britain]] ace [[Douglas Bader]] approached Brickhill in 1951 about collaborating on his biography.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 233 to 236.</ref> Brickhill agreed to undertake the project.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 239.</ref>\n\nAfter approaching several publishers about the proposed biography Brickhill's agent found that William Collins and Sons were prepared to offer the best terms, leading Brickhill to sign with them. However Brickhill felt guilty about not signing with John Pudney and Evans Brothers, who had previously been so supportive of him.  He consequently offered to write an anthology of escape stories for them, which they eventually published as ''Escape \u2013 Or Die''.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 240.</ref>\n\nThe resulting biography of Bader was published in 1954 as ''Reach for the Sky''. In the first few months alone, 172,000 copies were sold.<ref>Mackenzie. Page 164.</ref> The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain.\n\nThe book was subsequently adapted for the screen and released in 1956 as a [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|feature film]]. Starring [[Kenneth More]] as Bader, it topped the box office in Britain that year.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 303 to304.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBrickhill spent the rest of his life working on several unfinished film screenplays, novels and biographies, but was never able to repeat his successes of 1949 to 1954.\n\nIn 1969 he returned to live permanently in Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 355.</ref> Brickhill died in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] on 23 April 1991 aged 74.<ref name=ADB>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brickhill-paul-chester-14647 |title=Brickhill, Paul Chester (1916\u20131991) |first=Craig|last=Wilcox|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref> See also John Ramsland's update.<ref>John A Ramsland.

Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist\n|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/conservatives-0\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallup Poll\">{{cite web|title=In U.S., Nearly Half Identify as Economically Conservative|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/154889/Nearly-Half-Identify-Economically-Conservative.aspx\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F.

Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9\u201311, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

Many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose [[affirmative action]] policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \"[[reverse discrimination]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nConservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.\n\n=== Social issues ===\nOn social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles.

Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value.

They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V.

Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, \"U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\n<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.<ref>Herman Schwartz, \"The Supreme Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives.\" The ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 574.1 (2001): 119\u2013131.

Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated.

He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K.

The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order.

They are committed, says [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], to the belief in America's \"superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly status-bound system of European society.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEl91MbLiO0C&pg=PA44|year=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=44\u201345|isbn=9780739115169}}</ref>\n\n=== Ideology and political philosophy ===\nIn terms of governmental economic policies, American conservatives have been heavily influenced by the [[classical liberal]] or [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] tradition as expressed by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] and a major source of influence has been the [[Chicago school of economics]]. They have been strongly opposed to [[Keynesian economics]].<ref>George H.

Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs.

They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref>Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F. Hayward, ''The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980\u20131989'' (2009), p. 477.</ref> Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9\u201311, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

Although, the study does show some distinction between the concentration of moderates and conservatives or liberals between the Republican and Democratic parties. Among Democrats, 44% are self-identified liberals, 19% as conservatives, and 36% as moderates. For Republicans 70% self-identified as conservative, 24% as moderate, and 5% as liberal.\n\nConservatism appears to be growing stronger at the state level. The trend is most pronounced among the \"least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states.\" according to ''Atlantic'' writer [[Richard Florida]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |year=2012 |title=Why America Keeps Getting More Conservative |journal=The Atlantic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/why-america-keeps-getting-more-conservative/252995/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |year=2011 |title=The Conservative States of America |journal=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/the-conservative-states-of-america/71827/ }}</ref>\n\nConservatives generally believe that government action is not the solution to problems such as poverty and inequality. Many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose [[affirmative action]] policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \"[[reverse discrimination]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nConservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.\n\n=== Social issues ===\nOn social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles. They oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, civil unions, and anti-discrimination laws against homosexuals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Stanford|title=Homophobia in the Black Church: How Faith, Politics, and Fear Divide the Black Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu4aIFxQ7VwC&pg=PA101|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=101|isbn=9780313398698}}</ref> The libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues, instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy.

Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], and libertarian intellectuals such as [[David Boaz]] describe libertarianism as being \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"<ref name=Moseley>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Daniel|title=What is Libertarianism?|journal=Basic Income Studies|date=June 25, 2011|volume=6|issue=2|page=2|ssrn=1872578|accessdate=|doi=10.1515/1932-0183.1215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boaz|first=David|title=The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-vote-age-obama|work=Policy Analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 24, 2012|author2=David Kirby|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support [[protectionism]] instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V. Tushnet, ''A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future of Constitutional Law'' (2005) p. 338.</ref>\n\n==== Originalism ====\n{{main|Originalism}}\nA more recent variant that emerged in the 1980s is [[originalism]], the assertion that the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted. Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages.

Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated.

He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K.
