The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European theater of operations.\" The Group was first formed in December, 1943 and deactivated in December, 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C, |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Briquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was there that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Briquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189.}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using floats to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] recognized that the Treadway bridge was an essential piece of equipment to the campaign, easy to transport, quickly installed, and capable of sustaining heavy military loads.<ref name=\"Crusade in Europe\">{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Crusade in Europe |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=080185668X |page=380 |edition=1948 First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944]]\n\nOn August 17, 1944, the 1139th meet stiff resistance as they were trying to enter Chartres, France, requiring the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to take on their infantry role. They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreaux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot foot-bridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944 the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944\" |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.  The bridge building units worked under constant heavy mortar and artillery fire at these crossings, but were aided by the 161st Chemical Smoke Generating Company laying down a heavy smoke screen from hundreds of smoke generators and pots.  The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]]. In spite of the pressure of the continued rapid advance of the Group, morale among the troops remained at a high level.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944\" |page=9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rapid bridge-launching vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rapid bridge-launching vehicle, designed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group.]]\n\n[[File:730 foot Heavy Ponton Bridge built at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, Nov 17 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heavy Ponton Bridge built across the Moselle River at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, November 17, 1944]]\n\nDuring the month of October, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group grew to one of the largest tactical engineer groups in the United States Army.  Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.  (While functional, this vehicle was unfortunately found to be so heavy that it was not practical to move for any real distance).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cattennom France bridge lost under fire November 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cattennom, France, bridge lost under fire, November 1944]]\n\nThe month of November, 1944, was of extreme importance to the XX Corps because the crossing of the Moselle River and advancement eastward depended upon the success by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group in bridging the River.<ref name='=\"Headquarters Unit History, November 1\u201330, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; November 1-30, 1944 |date=January 4, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>  A total of eight bridges were constructed across the Moselle River by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group during the month; two Treadway M2s of 350 and 396 feet in length, one 630 foot Treadway M1, two Floating Baileys of 530 and 440 feet in length, one Baily DS, and two Heavy Ponton bridges of 730 and 675 feet in length.  These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most cases the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944\" |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to assist in overcoming the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944\" |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944\" |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December, 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.  On December 6, 1944,  the 90th Infantry Division, located near Wallerfangen, France, was ready to make the assault crossing. The 20th Engineer Combat Battalion commenced ferrying operations in [[Assault boat|Assault and storm boats]].  They ferried across two Battalions and part of a third battalion of the 38th Infantry Regiment, while the 179th Engineer Combat Battalion ferried the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 357th Infantry Regiment.  Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no let up in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.  The incoming fire was so heavy that power boats could not be brought down to the river for launching.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1\u201331, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, December 1 - 31, 1944 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, a ferry was constructed on December 8, 1944 for ferrying vehicles, anti-tank guns and tanks across the river at Wallerfangen, with additional ferries at Pachten-Dillingen and Rehlingen-Siersburg, France, which made it possible to ferry all the vehicles and tanks of the 90th Infantry as rapidly as they were needed to secure a beachhead on the eastern shore.  This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When he learned of the attack, General Patton quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, road blocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944\" |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.

This, in turn, allowed a 286-foot Heavy Ponton bridge and a 336-foot Treadway bridge to be built across the Sarr at Niederleuken and Schoden, Germany, so that both Infantry and Armor could cross and reduce the enemy on the eastern side of the Saar.  On March 6, 1945, an additional 336-foot Treadway M2 C1 bridge was then established at Konz Karthaus, Germany by the 179th and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.\n\nDuring the first part of March 1945, the Group was engaged in engineering work necessary for the rapid advancement of the XX Corps from the Saar to the Rhine Rivers.  In addition to construction of numerous Bailey Bridges and small fixed bridges, the Group was tasked with supervising civilian labor on road work, preparing gun emplacements for artillery pieces, constructing camouflage screens and anti-mine booms at bridges, removing dead animals from minefields, hauling prisoners, demolishing buildings to widen roads, painting town signs, and destroying enemy tanks and artillery pieces.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History March 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; March 1 - 31, 1945 |date=May 26, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonel Jackson and Colonel Niles at Rhine River Mainz, Germany, April 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Colonel Jackson (CO 160th) and Colonel Niles (CO 1139th) at Rhine River, Mainz, Germany, April 1945]]\n\nIn quick secession the American Armies were converging on the enemy in the Rhine-Moselle triangle; the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] from the North, the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th]] and [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th]] Armored Divisions from the South, and the [[United States Army Central|3rd]] and the [[Seventh United States Army|7th]] Armies from various locations.

Extensive studies were made by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to determine the best site for crossing.  Study of all available maps and photos determined that the downtown area of Mainz, Germany, was the best site, even though the Rhine was wider at that point.  Profiles were prepared for the entire area, indicating which terrain areas had to be captured or neutralized by artillery fire, and hydraulic data and river bed materials were studied to understand the types and sizes of anchors necessary for the bridge.  Finally site reconnaissance at the river's edge by Group personnel determined the exact location for the bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, March 1 - 31, 1945\" |page=2}}</ref>  This crossing required two assault operations lead by the 80th Infantry Division with support from the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion.<ref name=\"Builders and Fighters\">{{cite book |last1=Fowle |first1=Barry W. |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |location=Fort Belvoir, Virginia |isbn=9781410221773 |page=470 |edition=First Edition Revised 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe first infantry crossing (using assault boats) incurred a high causality rate, so the two battalions were then crossed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported Navel units.  Once the infantry was ashore, ferrying operations were carried on by Navy operated boats, using 6 [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] and 6 [[LCVP (United States)|Higgens Boats]].  During the launching there was heavy artillery fire, 20mm and small arms fire on the site, knocking out a bulldozer and killing a naval officer.  However the 997th Engineer Treadway Company with assistance from the 160th Engineer Combat Battalion was able to construct a Treadway M2 Bridge across the Rhine 1,896 feet long; ''the Longest Tactical Bridge built in the European theater of operations''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |page=471}}</ref><ref>The 1370 foot long ponton bridge built by the [[107th Engineer Battalion]] was the longest tactical floating bridge as of March 22, 1945.</ref>  This bridge served the entire XX Corps in crossing the Rhine, and marked the end of assault phase of the Rhein in the Third Army area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=113.

On March 31, 1945 the Third Army started it's run towards Berlin, from Mainz, Germany, traveling north-east through Frankfurt to Friedberg, to Alsfeld, then, crossing the Fulda River with a 312-foot Treadway M2 Bridge, on to Reichensachen, Germany.  Then traveling eastward they next bridged the Werra River and traveled to Langensalza, Germany, and after bridging the Helme River on April 11, 1945, they traveled along the [[Autobahn]] for two days constructing Bailey Bridges where needed to repair sections of the highway that had been destroyed by allied bombardment.  While traveling the Autobahn, they came across an area where the median strip had been paved as a landing airstrip and painted green, and on it sat an unusual looking plane with no propeller.  It turned out to be one of the German Jet planes that had been abandoned during the rapid retreat of the German Army.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Michael, SSGT, 1139th Engineer Combat Group |title=Personal Interview, July, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VE Day Passing out Champagne to 1139th troops.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops celebrating VE Day with Champagne, near Lambach, Austria, May 8, 1945]]\n\nThe 1139th stopped in Weimar, Germany on April 13, 1945.  Here they were situated in the most luxurious barracks that they had stayed in; formerly used by German Anti-aircraft troops.  However, it was also here that they saw their most horrible of all sights; the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald Concentration Camp]].  The Third Army had liberated the camp just two days earlier.  At the urging of General Patton, many of the 1139th troops visited the camp and saw the walking skeletons, stacks of withered corpses, and incompletely burned bodies, pits of lime covered bodies, and all saw emaciated inmates from the camp walking along the road towards Weimer, and heard firsthand accounts about the horrors from a former Captain of the Dutch army, who was taken in from the camp to act as an interpreter.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=26}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 1945, the Third army continued moving eastward until it arrived just outside of Chemnitz, Germany.  At this point, they were only 135 miles from Berlin.  However, with the threat of a [[National redoubt|National Redoubt]] (potential reorganization and resistance by the remainder of the German army), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] ordered Patton's army southward toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand there by Nazi German forces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=397}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Soldier's Story |page=536}}</ref> The XX Corps raced southwestward to Lichtenfels, Germany; bridging the Saale and the Weisse rivers, arriving April 18, 1945.

On April 27, 1945, they traveled to Regensburg where they stopped to develop plans for crossing the Danube River.

This coal was key to allowing Germany to rebuild its industries and in turn to feed its own population.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=442}}</ref>\n\nColonel Niles and the 1139th Engineer Combat Group were given this duty. The 1139th was assigned to get the Bavarian and Saar coal mines back in operation.  This included clearing and preparing the mine sites for return to operations, and because there were few returning coal miners, the 1139th's Engineers were also required to providing training and education to the surviving populous on running the mine.  The 1139th worked on the mine projects for many months.  During these activities the 1139th was experiencing a slow reduction in troop size as the GIs with 45 VE Day points or more were discharged and returned home to the states.<ref name=\"Interview\" />\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group was disbanded in December, 1946, with the last of the troops returning to the states.\n\n= Tables and Documents =\n\n== Table 1: Divisions and Regiments that were supported by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group ==\n{|class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European theater of operations.\" The Group was first formed in December, 1943 and deactivated in December, 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C, |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Briquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was there that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Briquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189.}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using floats to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] recognized that the Treadway bridge was an essential piece of equipment to the campaign, easy to transport, quickly installed, and capable of sustaining heavy military loads.<ref name=\"Crusade in Europe\">{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Crusade in Europe |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=080185668X |page=380 |edition=1948 First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944]]\n\nOn August 17, 1944, the 1139th meet stiff resistance as they were trying to enter Chartres, France, requiring the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to take on their infantry role. They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreaux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot foot-bridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944 the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.

This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most cases the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.

Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no let up in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.

This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When he learned of the attack, General Patton quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, road blocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944\" |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.

Rubato is an expressive shaping of music that is a part of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924021632256#page/n138/mode/1up/search/rubato Phrasing and Rubato] \u2013 The musiclover's handbook, containing (1) a pronouncing dictionary of musical terms and (2) biographical dictionary of musicians (1911) by John Clifford</ref>\n\nWhile rubato is often loosely taken to mean playing with expressive and rhythmic freedom,  it was traditionally used specifically in the context of expression as speeding up and then slowing down the tempo. In the past, expressive and free playing (beyond only rubato) was often associated with the terms \"ad libitum\". Rubato, even when not notated, is often used liberally by musicians, e.g. singers frequently use it intuitively to let the tempo of the melody expressively shift slightly and freely above that of the [[accompaniment]]. This intuitive shifting leads to rubato's main effect: making music sound expressive and natural. Nineteenth century composer-pianist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] is often mentioned in the context of rubato (see [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin#Technique and performance style|Chopin's technique and performance style]]).\n\nThe term ''rubato'' existed even before the romantic era. In the 18th century, rubato meant expressing rhythm spontaneously, with freedom.<ref>Rosenblum, Sandra P., \"The Uses of Rubato in Music, Eighteenth to Twentieth Centuries\", ''Performance Practice Review'' Volume 7, no. 1, Article 3, 1994, p. 33</ref> In many cases, it was achieved by playing uneven notes. This idea was used, among others, by Ernst Wilhelm Wolf and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]].<ref name=\":4\">Rosenblum, p. 35</ref>  In addition to that, Leopold Mozart claimed that the accompaniment should remain strict in tempo.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the meaning of Rubato began to change gradually. People were using the term as being able to move notes freely back and forth. [[Johann Friedrich Agricola]] interpreted rubato as \"stealing the time\".<ref>Rosenblum, p. 37</ref>\n\nAs time moves on to the 19th century, people recognized rubato yet slightly differently. In Chopin's music rubato functioned as a way to make a melody more emotional through changing the tempo by, for instance, accelerando, ritenuto and syncopations. Chopin \"often played with the melody subtly lingering or passionately anticipating the beat while the accompaniment stayed at least relatively, if not strictly, in time\".<ref>Rosenblum, p. 41</ref> In this case, rubato is used as a concept of flexibility of tempo for a more expressive melody.\n\n==Types==\nOne can distinguish two types of rubato: in one the tempo of the melody is flexible, while the accompaniment is kept in typical regular pulse (yet not rigidly in mechanical fashion; but adjusting to the melody as necessary\u2014[[Tempo rubato#\"Accompaniment yields/adjusts to melody\"|see below]]). Another type affects melody and accompaniment. While it is often associated with music of the [[Romantic music|Romantic Period]], classical performers frequently use rubato for emotional expressiveness in all kinds of works.\n\n{{quote|multiline=y|''Tempo rubato'' (or ''a tempo rubato'') means literally ''in robbed time'', i.e., duration taken from one measure or beat and given to another, but in modern practice the term is quite generally applied to any irregularity of rhythm or tempo not definitely indicated in the score.<br />The terms ''ad libitum'', (''ad lib.''), ''a piacere'', and ''a capriccio'', also indicate a modification of the tempo at the will of the performer. ''Ad libitum'' means at liberty; ''a piacere'', at pleasure; and ''a capriccio'', at the caprice (of the performer).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/musicnotationter00gehruoft#page/n69/mode/1up/search/robbed Tempo Rubato]; Music notation and terminology (1921) by Karl Wilson Gehrkens</ref>|''Music notation and terminology'' (1921) by Karl Wilson Gehrkens}}\n\n{{quote|multiline=y|''A tempo rubato''. Lit. \"in robbed time\", i. e. time in which, while every bar is of its proper time value, one portion of it may be played faster or slower at the expense of the remaining portion, so that, if the first half be somewhat slackened, the second half is somewhat quickened, and ''vice versa''. With indifferent performers, this indication is too often confounded with some expression signifying ''ad libitum''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryoffore00wottrich#page/5/mode/1up/search/rubato Tempo Rubato]; A dictionary of foreign musical terms and handbook of orchestral instruments (1907) by Tom S. Wotton</ref>|''A dictionary of foreign musical terms and handbook of orchestral instruments'' (1907) by Tom S. Wotton}}\n\nThe opinion given by Tom S. Wotton, that \"every bar has its proper time value\" may be regarded as an inaccurate description: Karl Wilson Gehrkens mentions \"duration taken from one measure [...] and given to another\" which implies bars of differing duration. Rubato relates to [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]; and since phrases often go over multiple bars; it is often impossible (and also not desired) for each bar to be identically long.\n\n=== Early twentieth century ===\nEarly twentieth-century rubato seems to be very eventful. Robert Philip in his in his book ''Early recordings and musical style: Changing tastes in instrumental performance, 1900-1950'' specifies three types of rubato used at that time: accelerando and rallentando, tenuto and agogic accents, and melodic rubato.<ref name=\":0\">Philip, Robert, ''Early Recordings and Musical Style: Changing Tastes In Instrumental Performance, 1900-1950.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992</ref>\n\n'''Accelerando and rallentando'''\n\nLate 19th century dictionaries of musical terms defined tempo rubato as \u201crobbed or stolen time.\u201d This effect can be achieved by a slight quickening of speed in ascending passages, for instance, and calando on descending phrases. [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] says that tempo rubato relies on \u201cmore or less important slackening or quickening of the time or rate of the movement.\u201d<ref>Philip, p. 38</ref> Many theoreticians and performers claimed at that time that the \u201crobbed\u201d time must be eventually \u201cpaid back\u201d later within the same measure, so that the change of tempo would not affect the length of the measure.<ref name=\":1\">Philip, p. 40</ref> However, the balance theory caused controversy, as many theoreticians dismissed the assumption that the \u201cstolen\u201d time should necessarily be \u201cpaid back.\u201d In the third edition of ''Grove's Dictionary'' we read: \u201cThe rule has been given and repeated indiscriminately that the \u201crobbed\u201d time must be \u201cpaid back\u201d within the bar. That is absurd, because the bar line is a notational, not a musical, matter. But there is no necessity to pay back even within the phrase: it is the metaphor that is wrong.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPaderewski also discarded this theory saying: \u201c(...) the value of notes diminished in one period through an ''accelerando,'' cannot always be restored in another through a ''ritardando.'' What is lost is lost.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome theoreticians, however, rejected even the idea that rubato relies on accelerando and ritardando. They were not recommending that a performance should be strictly metronomic, but they came up with a theory saying that rubato should consist of tenuto and shortened notes.<ref name=\":2\">Philip, p. 41</ref>\n\n'''Tenuto and agogic accents'''\n\nThe first writer who extended the theory of \u201cagogics\u201d was [[Hugo Riemann]] in his book ''Musikalische Dynamik und Agogic'' (1984).<ref name=\":2\" /> The theory was based on the idea of using small changes of rhythm and tempo for expression. Riemann used the term \u201cagogic accent\u201d, by which he meant accentuation achieved by lengthening of a note.\n\nThe theory found many supporters. J. Alfred Johnstone called the idea of agogic accents \u201cquasi tempo rubato.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> He also expressed his appreciation for this theory saying that \u201cmodern editors are coming to recognize it as one of the important principles of expressive interpretation.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> In his illustration of agogic accents in the Mendelssohn's ''Andante and Rondo Capriccioso'' op. 14, Johnstone explains, that even though the rhythm consists of equal quarter notes, they should not be played the same length; the highest note of the phrase ought to be the longest while other notes shortened proportionally.<ref name=\":2\" /> One of the musicians known for using agogic accents in their playing was the violinist Joseph Joachim.\n\nSome writers compared this type of rubato to declamation in speech.<ref name=\":3\">Philip, p. 42</ref> This idea was widely developed by singers. According to Gordon Heller:\u201cIf groups of notes happen to occur, which have to be sung to one word, the student must be careful to make the first note very slightly longer \u2013 though only very slightly \u2013 than the rest of the group. Should a triplet be written by the composer, care must be taken here to make the first note of the three a trifle longer than the rest, and thus give a musicianly rendering of it. To hurry the time in such a pace would spoil the rhythm...\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Melodic rubato'''\n\nBoth of the theories described above had their opponents and supporters. There was one question, though, that emerged in reference to both. Regardless if a melody is released from strict note values by accelerando and ritardando or agogic accents, should the accompaniment follow the melody or remain strict in time? The latter means that the melody would be either behind or ahead of the accompaniment for a moment. Eventually, in spite of doubts of some, it has become a tradition that the accompaniment did not follow the flexibility of the melody. As Franklin Taylor writes: \u201cIt should be observed that any independent accompaniment to a rubato phrase must always keep strict time, and it is, therefore, quite possible that no note of a rubato melody will fall exactly with its corresponding note in the accompaniment, except, perhaps, the first note in the bar.\"<ref>Philip, p. 43</ref>\n\nRobert Philip's further research shows that these three components (accelerando and rallentando, tenuto and agogic accents, and melodic rubato) were most often used together, as each performer could combine all of them and give the melody flexibility in their own specific way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Chopin ==\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Frederic Chopin]] (1810\u20131849) wrote the term ''rubato'' in fourteen different works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Performance Practice: A Dictionary-Guide for Musicians|last=Jackson|first=Roland|publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=88}}</ref> All of the spots marked rubato in his fourteen compositions have a flowing melody in the right hand and several accompanying notes in the left hand. Thus, Chopin's rubato can be approached with delaying or anticipating those melody notes. According to descriptions of Chopin's playing, he played with the melody slightly delaying or excitedly anticipating the beat while the left-hand accompaniment went on playing in time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Sandra P.|date=1994|title=The Uses of Rubato in Music, Eighteenth to Twentieth Centuries|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/ppr/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=Performance Practice Review|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41\u201342|doi=10.5642/perfpr.199407.01.03|via=}}</ref>\n\nUsually, his usage of the term ''rubato'' in a score suggested a brief effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000024039|title=Rubato {{!}} Grove Music|website=www.oxfordmusiconline.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.24039|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> However, when the term ''[[sempre]] rubato'' was marked, it indicated a rubato that continued for about two measures. Interestingly, Chopin never marked ''a tempo'' following ''rubato.'' This leaves the length of the \u201cmomentary effect\u201d up to the interpretation of the performer. Therefore, the performer must understand the purpose of why rubato is indicated from the composer.\n\nThere are three purposes why Chopin marks the word ''rubato'' in his compositions: to articulate a repetition, to emphasize an expressive high point or [[appoggiatura]] and to set a particular mood at the beginning of a piece.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Stolen Time: the History of Tempo Rubato|last=Hudson|first=Richard|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=230\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nThe first main purpose for which Chopin marks rubato is to articulate the repetition of a unit of music. For example, the rubato marked in bar 9 in Mazurka Op. 6 No. 1 points out the beginning of the repetition after the first eight-measure unit. Another example of this usage of rubato occurs in the Mazurka Op. 7 No. 3. In this piece, the theme begins at measure 9 and repeats at measure 17, which is where the rubato is marked. From this, the performer is given the cue to approach the repeated material differently the second time it occurs.                                   \n[[File:Mazurka_Op._6_No._1.png|alt=|thumb|F.

For example, in the Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2, bar 26 has an intensely singing moment where the melody leaps up to an E-flat. However, this E-flat is not the highest point of the phrase. Therefore, Chopin marked ''poco rubato'' to signify to the player that they can emphasize the intensely expressive moment, but to also hold back for the actual climax occurring one measure later.<ref name=\":5\" /> A second example of rubato used at a singing moment is in his Second Piano Concerto. In a similar situation, the melody leaps up to three A-flat played consecutively and the rubato marked tells the player to perform them in a singing quality.   \n[[File:Nocturne_Op._9_No._2_bar_26-27.png|thumb|F. Chopin, Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2, S\u00e4mtliche Pianoforte-Werke, Band I, C.F.Peters, 1905, image form imslp.]]\nChopin primarily marks rubato to emphasize expressive melodic lines or repetition. However, in some cases, he also uses rubato to establish a certain mood at the beginning of a piece. The Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3 is one of the examples of rubato being used for setting up a mood. In the Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3, Chopin marked ''Languido e rubato'' in the first bar, as a general suggestion of the work's comprehensive way of delivery.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD8rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=Chopin+Nocturne+Op.+9+No.+2+poco+rubato+sing&source=bl&ots=-Z8aEHQLzK&sig=ACfU3U2sNr0eNgxrzcrKmVGcA_4jjkLWzg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibubO8i_DkAhWsTt8KHUlsANgQ6AEwFnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Chopin%20Nocturne%20Op.%209%20No.%202%20poco%20rubato%20sing&f=false|title=Reading Musical Interpretation: Case Studies in Solo Piano Performance|last=Hellaby|first=Julian|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351552196|location=|pages=44|language=en}}</ref> The rubato in a languid manner would affect the tempo, tone color, touch, and dynamics, which influence performers to set the mood at the beginning of the piece.<ref name=\":5\" />  \n[[File:Nocturne_Op._15_No._3.png|thumb|F.Chopin, Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3, Klavierwerke.

Rubato is an expressive shaping of music that is a part of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924021632256#page/n138/mode/1up/search/rubato Phrasing and Rubato] \u2013 The musiclover's handbook, containing (1) a pronouncing dictionary of musical terms and (2) biographical dictionary of musicians (1911) by John Clifford</ref>\n\nWhile rubato is often loosely taken to mean playing with expressive and rhythmic freedom,  it was traditionally used specifically in the context of expression as speeding up and then slowing down the tempo. In the past, expressive and free playing (beyond only rubato) was often associated with the terms \"ad libitum\". Rubato, even when not notated, is often used liberally by musicians, e.g. singers frequently use it intuitively to let the tempo of the melody expressively shift slightly and freely above that of the [[accompaniment]]. This intuitive shifting leads to rubato's main effect: making music sound expressive and natural. Nineteenth century composer-pianist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] is often mentioned in the context of rubato (see [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin#Technique and performance style|Chopin's technique and performance style]]).\n\nThe term ''rubato'' existed even before the romantic era. In the 18th century, rubato meant expressing rhythm spontaneously, with freedom. <ref>Rosenblum, Sandra P., \"The Uses of Rubato in Music, Eighteenth to Twentieth Centuries\", ''Performance Practice Review'' Volume 7, no. 1, Article 3, 1994, p. 33</ref> In many cases, it was achieved by playing uneven notes. This idea was used, among others, by Ernst Wilhelm Wolf and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]].<ref name=\":4\">Rosenblum, p. 35</ref>  In addition to that, Leopold Mozart claimed that the accompaniment should remain strict in tempo.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the meaning of Rubato began to change gradually. People were using the term as being able to move notes freely back and forth. [[Johann Friedrich Agricola]] interpreted rubato as \"stealing the time\".<ref>Rosenblum, p. 37</ref> \n\nAs time moves on to the 19th century, people recognized rubato yet slightly differently. In Chopin's music rubato functioned as a way to make a melody more emotional through changing the tempo by, for instance, accelerando, ritenuto and syncopations. Chopin \"often played with the melody subtly lingering or passionately anticipating the beat while the accompaniment stayed at least relatively, if not strictly, in time\".<ref>Rosenblum, p. 41</ref> In this case, rubato is used as a concept of flexibility of tempo for a more expressive melody.\n\n==Types==\nOne can distinguish two types of rubato: in one the tempo of the melody is flexible, while the accompaniment is kept in typical regular pulse (yet not rigidly in mechanical fashion; but adjusting to the melody as necessary\u2014[[Tempo rubato#\"Accompaniment yields/adjusts to melody\"|see below]]). Another type affects melody and accompaniment. While it is often associated with music of the [[Romantic music|Romantic Period]], classical performers frequently use rubato for emotional expressiveness in all kinds of works.\n\n{{quote|multiline=y|''Tempo rubato'' (or ''a tempo rubato'') means literally ''in robbed time'', i.e., duration taken from one measure or beat and given to another, but in modern practice the term is quite generally applied to any irregularity of rhythm or tempo not definitely indicated in the score.<br />The terms ''ad libitum'', (''ad lib.''), ''a piacere'', and ''a capriccio'', also indicate a modification of the tempo at the will of the performer. ''Ad libitum'' means at liberty; ''a piacere'', at pleasure; and ''a capriccio'', at the caprice (of the performer).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/musicnotationter00gehruoft#page/n69/mode/1up/search/robbed Tempo Rubato]; Music notation and terminology (1921) by Karl Wilson Gehrkens</ref>|''Music notation and terminology'' (1921) by Karl Wilson Gehrkens}}\n\n{{quote|multiline=y|''A tempo rubato''. Lit. \"in robbed time\", i. e. time in which, while every bar is of its proper time value, one portion of it may be played faster or slower at the expense of the remaining portion, so that, if the first half be somewhat slackened, the second half is somewhat quickened, and ''vice versa''. With indifferent performers, this indication is too often confounded with some expression signifying ''ad libitum''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryoffore00wottrich#page/5/mode/1up/search/rubato Tempo Rubato]; A dictionary of foreign musical terms and handbook of orchestral instruments (1907) by Tom S.

Wotton, that \"every bar has its proper time value\" may be regarded as an inaccurate description: Karl Wilson Gehrkens mentions \"duration taken from one measure [...] and given to another\" which implies bars of differing duration. Rubato relates to [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]; and since phrases often go over multiple bars; it is often impossible (and also not desired) for each bar to be identically long.\n=== Early twentieth century ===\nEarly twentieth-century rubato seems to be very eventful. Robert Philip in his in his book ''Early recordings and musical style: Changing tastes in instrumental performance, 1900-1950'' specifies three types of rubato used at that time: accelerando and rallentando, tenuto and agogic accents, and melodic rubato.<ref name=\":0\">Philip, Robert, ''Early Recordings and Musical Style: Changing Tastes In Instrumental Performance, 1900-1950.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992</ref>\n\n'''Accelerando and rallentando'''\n\nLate 19<sup>th</sup> century dictionaries of musical terms defined tempo rubato as \u201crobbed or stolen time.\u201d This effect can be achieved by a slight quickening of speed in ascending passages, for instance, and calando on descending phrases. [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] says that tempo rubato relies on \u201cmore or less important slackening or quickening of the time or rate of the movement.\u201d<ref>Philip, p. 38</ref> Many theoreticians and performers claimed at that time that the \u201crobbed\u201d time must be eventually \u201cpaid back\u201d later within the same measure, so that the change of tempo would not affect the length of the measure.<ref name=\":1\">Philip, p. 40</ref> However, the balance theory caused controversy, as many theoreticians dismissed the assumption that the \u201cstolen\u201d time should necessarily be \u201cpaid back.\u201d In the third edition of ''Grove's Dictionary'' we read: \u201cThe rule has been given and repeated indiscriminately that the \u201crobbed\u201d time must be \u201cpaid back\u201d within the bar. That is absurd, because the bar line is a notational, not a musical, matter. But there is no necessity to pay back even within the phrase: it is the metaphor that is wrong.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPaderewski also discarded this theory saying: \u201c(...) the value of notes diminished in one period through an ''accelerando,'' cannot always be restored in another through a ''ritardando.'' What is lost is lost.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome theoreticians, however, rejected even the idea that rubato relies on accelerando and ritardando. They were not recommending that a performance should be strictly metronomic, but they came up with a theory saying that rubato should consist of tenuto and shortened notes.<ref name=\":2\">Philip, p. 41</ref>\n\n'''Tenuto and agogic accents'''\n\nThe first writer who extended the theory of \u201cagogics\u201d was [[Hugo Riemann]] in his book ''Musikalische Dynamik und Agogic'' (1984)<ref name=\":2\" />. The theory was based on the idea of using small changes of rhythm and tempo for expression. Riemann used the term \u201cagogic accent\u201d, by which he meant accentuation achieved by lengthening of a note.\n\nThe theory found many supporters. J. Alfred Johnstone called the idea of agogic accents \u201cquasi tempo rubato.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> He also expressed his appreciation for this theory saying that \u201cmodern editors are coming to recognize it as one of the important principles of expressive interpretation.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> In his illustration of agogic accents in the Mendelssohn's ''Andante and Rondo Capriccioso'' op. 14, Johnstone explains, that even though the rhythm consists of equal quarter notes, they should not be played the same length; the highest note of the phrase ought to be the longest while other notes shortened proportionally.<ref name=\":2\" /> One of the musicians known for using agogic accents in their playing was the violinist Joseph Joachim.\n\nSome writers compared this type of rubato to declamation in speech.<ref name=\":3\">Philip, p. 42</ref> This idea was widely developed by singers. According to Gordon Heller:\u201cIf groups of notes happen to occur, which have to be sung to one word, the student must be careful to make the first note very slightly longer \u2013 though only very slightly \u2013 than the rest of the group. Should a triplet be written by the composer, care must be taken here to make the first note of the three a trifle longer than the rest, and thus give a musicianly rendering of it. To hurry the time in such a pace would spoil the rhythm...\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Melodic rubato'''\n\nBoth of the theories described above had their opponents and supporters. There was one question, though, that emerged in reference to both. Regardless if a melody is released from strict note values by accelerando and ritardando or agogic accents, should the accompaniment follow the melody or remain strict in time? The latter means that the melody would be either behind or ahead of the accompaniment for a moment. Eventually, in spite of doubts of some, it has become a tradition that the accompaniment did not follow the flexibility of the melody. As Franklin Taylor writes: \u201cIt should be observed that any independent accompaniment to a rubato phrase must always keep strict time, and it is, therefore, quite possible that no note of a rubato melody will fall exactly with its corresponding note in the accompaniment, except, perhaps, the first note in the bar.\"<ref>Philip, p. 43</ref>\n\nRobert Philip's further research shows that these three components (accelerando and rallentando, tenuto and agogic accents, and melodic rubato) were most often used together, as each performer could combine all of them and give the melody flexibility in their own specific way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Chopin ==\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Frederic Chopin]] (1810-1849) wrote the term ''rubato'' in fourteen different works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Performance Practice: A Dictionary-Guide for Musicians|last=Jackson|first=Roland|publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=88}}</ref> All of the spots marked rubato in his fourteen compositions have a flowing melody in the right hand and several accompanying notes in the left hand. Thus, Chopin\u2019s rubato can be approached with delaying or anticipating those melody notes. According to descriptions of Chopin\u2019s playing, he played with the melody slightly delaying or excitedly anticipating the beat while the left-hand accompaniment went on playing in time. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Sandra P.|date=1994|title=The Uses of Rubato in Music, Eighteenth to Twentieth Centuries|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/ppr/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=Performance Practice Review|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41-42|doi=10.5642/perfpr.199407.01.03|via=}}</ref>\n\nUsually, his usage of the term ''rubato'' in a score suggested a brief effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000024039|title=Rubato {{!}} Grove Music|website=www.oxfordmusiconline.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.24039|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> However, when the term ''[[sempre]] rubato'' was marked, it indicated a rubato that continued for about two measures. Interestingly, Chopin never marked ''a tempo'' following ''rubato.'' This leaves the length of the \u201cmomentary effect\u201d up to the interpretation of the performer. Therefore, the performer must understand the purpose of why rubato is indicated from the composer.\n\nThere are three purposes why Chopin marks the word ''rubato'' in his compositions: to articulate a repetition, to emphasize an expressive high point or [[appoggiatura]] and to set a particular mood at the beginning of a piece. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Stolen Time: the History of Tempo Rubato|last=Hudson|first=Richard|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=230-231}}</ref>\n\nThe first main purpose for which Chopin marks rubato is to articulate the repetition of a unit of music. For example, the rubato marked in bar 9 in Mazurka Op. 6 No. 1 points out the beginning of the repetition after the first eight-measure unit. Another example of this usage of rubato occurs in the Mazurka Op. 7 No. 3. In this piece, the theme begins at measure 9 and repeats at measure 17, which is where the rubato is marked. From this, the performer is given the cue to approach the repeated material differently the second time it occurs.                                   \n[[File:Mazurka_Op._6_No._1.png|alt=|thumb|F.

For example, in the Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2, bar 26 has an intensely singing moment where the melody leaps up to an E-flat. However, this E-flat is not the highest point of the phrase. Therefore, Chopin marked ''poco rubato'' to signify to the player that they can emphasize the intensely expressive moment, but to also hold back for the actual climax occurring one measure later.<ref name=\":5\" /> A second example of rubato used at a singing moment is in his Second Piano Concerto. In a similar situation, the melody leaps up to three A-flat played consecutively and the rubato marked tells the player to perform them in a singing quality.   \n[[File:Nocturne_Op._9_No._2_bar_26-27.png|thumb|F. Chopin, Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2, S\u00e4mtliche Pianoforte-Werke, Band I , C.F.Peters, 1905, image form imslp.]]\nChopin primarily marks rubato to emphasize expressive melodic lines or repetition. However, in some cases, he also uses rubato to establish a certain mood at the beginning of a piece. The Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3 is one of the examples of rubato being used for setting up a mood. In the Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3, Chopin marked ''Languido e rubato'' in the first bar, as a general suggestion of the work's comprehensive way of delivery.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD8rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=Chopin+Nocturne+Op.+9+No.+2+poco+rubato+sing&source=bl&ots=-Z8aEHQLzK&sig=ACfU3U2sNr0eNgxrzcrKmVGcA_4jjkLWzg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibubO8i_DkAhWsTt8KHUlsANgQ6AEwFnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Chopin%20Nocturne%20Op.%209%20No.%202%20poco%20rubato%20sing&f=false|title=Reading Musical Interpretation: Case Studies in Solo Piano Performance|last=Hellaby|first=Julian|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351552196|location=|pages=44|language=en}}</ref> The rubato in a languid manner would affect the tempo, tone color, touch, and dynamics, which influence performers to set the mood at the beginning of the piece.<ref name=\":5\" />  \n[[File:Nocturne_Op._15_No._3.png|thumb|F.Chopin, Nocturne Op. 15 No. 3, Klavierwerke.

Pushkin wrote the story in autumn 1833 in [[Boldino]],<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 424.</ref> and it was first published in the literary magazine {{transl|ru|Biblioteka dlya chteniya}} in March [[1834 in literature|1834]].<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nThe story was the basis of the operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1890) by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], {{lang|fr|La dame de pique}} (1850) by [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy]] and {{lang|de|[[Pique Dame (Supp\u00e9)|Pique Dame]]}} (1864) by [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]]<ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2005/10/the_operatic_pu.php The Operatic Pushkin].</ref> (the overture to the Supp\u00e9 work is all that remains in today's repertoire). It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]] who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage|title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated)|last=Pushkin|first=Alexander|date=2013-11-17|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=9781908909688|language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text.

These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances.

It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]] who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage|title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated)|last=Pushkin|first=Alexander|date=2013-11-17|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=9781908909688|language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details\u2014May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast.

One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details\u2014May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

The digital translator, which signed on the air in 2009, is a conversion of a former [[analog television|analog]] translator, W58AM, which broadcast at the same location.<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?call=W44CR-D FCC TV query for W44CR-D]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Wneo Weao.PNG|115px|thumb|left|WNEO/WEAO's former logo as \"PBS 45 & 49\".]]\n[[File:Wneo weao wr.png|115px|thumb|left|First WNEO/WEAO logo as \"Western Reserve PBS\"; used until November 4, 2019.]]\nWNEO first signed on the air on May 30, 1973. It was originally intended to serve all of northeast Ohio from Youngstown to Cleveland. Its city of license, Alliance, is split between both major markets in the region. Most of the city is in [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]], which is in the Cleveland market; a small portion is in [[Mahoning County, Ohio|Mahoning County]], home to Youngstown. However, it was later decided to reorient WNEO to serve Youngstown and sign on a satellite station to serve Akron and Cleveland. That station, WEAO, signed on the air more than two years later on September 21, 1975. Prior to WEAO's sign-on, the channel 49 allocation in the Cleveland/Akron market was occupied by Akron-based WAKR-TV from 1953 to 1967, when that station moved to UHF channel 23 (WAKR now operates as [[Ion Television]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WVPX-TV]]).\n\nUntil October 1, 2008, WEAO and WNEO were jointly branded as \"PBS 45 & 49\". On October 1, 2008 at 5:30&nbsp;a.m., WNEO and WEAO changed their on-air branding to \"[[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] PBS\", as part of the parent organization's overall branding change to Western Reserve Public Media.<ref>[http://www.westernreservepbs.org/news/newname08.htm PBS 45 & 49 to Change Name to Western Reserve Public Media]</ref> The rebranding was done to make the station's identity better reflect the viewing area, and due to the fact that the combined WNEO/WEAO operations are broadcast on different cable, satellite and [[UHF]] antenna channels in their respective service areas.<ref>[http://www.westernreservepbs.org/newname.htm PBS 45 & 49 Announces New Name and Stakes Its Claim in the Western Reserve]</ref>\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe stations' digital signals are [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The digital translator, which signed on the air in 2009, is a conversion of a former [[analog television|analog]] translator, W58AM, which broadcast at the same location.<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?call=W44CR-D FCC TV query for W44CR-D]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Wneo Weao.PNG|115px|thumb|left|WNEO/WEAO's former logo as \"PBS 45 & 49\".]]\n[[File:Wneo weao wr.png|115px|thumb|left|First WNEO/WEAO logo as \"Western Reserve PBS\"; used until November 4, 2019.]]\nWNEO first signed on the air on May 30, 1973. It was originally intended to serve all of northeast Ohio from Youngstown to Cleveland. Its city of license, Alliance, is split between both major markets in the region. Most of the city is in [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]], which is in the Cleveland market; a small portion is in [[Mahoning County, Ohio|Mahoning County]], home to Youngstown. However, it was later decided to reorient WNEO to serve Youngstown and sign on a satellite station to serve Akron and Cleveland. That station, WEAO, signed on the air more than two years later on September 21, 1975. Prior to WEAO's sign-on, the channel 49 allocation in the Cleveland/Akron market was occupied by Akron-based WAKR-TV from 1953 to 1967, when that station moved to UHF channel 23 (WAKR now operates as [[Ion Television]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WVPX-TV]]).\n\nUntil October 1, 2008, WEAO and WNEO were jointly branded as \"PBS 45 & 49\". On October 1, 2008 at 5:30&nbsp;a.m., WNEO and WEAO changed their on-air branding to \"[[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] PBS\", as part of the parent organization's overall branding change to Western Reserve Public Media.<ref>[http://www.westernreservepbs.org/news/newname08.htm PBS 45 & 49 to Change Name to Western Reserve Public Media]</ref> The rebranding was done to make the station's identity better reflect the viewing area, and due to the fact that the combined WNEO/WEAO operations are broadcast on different cable, satellite and [[UHF]] antenna channels in their respective service areas.<ref>[http://www.westernreservepbs.org/newname.htm PBS 45 & 49 Announces New Name and Stakes Its Claim in the Western Reserve]</ref>\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe stations' digital signals are [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
