In the 19th century, much of the area economy (especially the cultivation of tobacco and hemp) depended on enslaved labor. After Reconstruction, racial violence increased in this area, when whites worked to ensure dominance.<!-- Cited examples are given in body of article below, as well as for the noted lynchings --> As the county seat, Franklin was the site of several [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African-American men]] in this period. Franklin was a trading and judicial center for Williamson County, which was primarily rural in land use into the late 20th century, with an economy based on traditional commodity crops and purebred livestock.\n\nSince 1980, the northern part of the county has been developed for residential and related businesses, in addition to modern service industries. The population has increased rapidly, with growth stimulated by that of the Nashville metropolitan area. Despite recent growth and development, Franklin is noted for its many historic buildings and neighborhoods, which are protected by city ordinances.<ref>[https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2017/11/05/franklin-tennessee-preservation-heritage-foundation-carnton-plantation/764919001/ How Franklin has preserved history for 50 years] (''USA Today'')</ref>\n\nSince 2017, its two historic plantations have begun to provide extended tours including the antebellum history of enslaved workers at those sites. In 2018, as a result of multi-racial leadership, the city installed the first of five historic plaques in the courthouse square as part of the \"Fuller Story\", the first acknowledgement of the 220-year history of African Americans in the city. In 2019 a memorial statue of a soldier of the [[United States Colored Troops]] will be installed to join the Confederate memorial statue in the square.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Confederate Monument, Franklin, Tennessee.jpg|thumb|right|[[Confederate monument (Franklin, Tennessee)|Confederate monument, known as \"Chip\"]], dedicated in 1899]]\n\n===18th century===\nThe European-American community of Franklin was founded October 26, 1799, by Abram Maury, Jr. (1766\u20131825).

Cameron was an immigrant, born February 23, 1768, in Bogallan, [[Ferintosh, Black Isle|Ferintosh]], [[Scotland]]. He immigrated to [[Virginia]] in 1785 and traveled into Tennessee along with other migrants after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. They displaced the indigenous tribes that had historically occupied this region. Cameron died on February 28, 1846, after living 48 years in the same house. He and his second wife, Mary, were buried in the old City Cemetery. Some of his descendants continue to live in Franklin.\n\n===19th century===\nThis area is part of [[Middle Tennessee]], and white planters prospered in the antebellum years, with cultivation of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and raising of purebred livestock. Many migrants came from central Kentucky, where they had raised these crops and livestock. Through the antebellum years, white farmers depended on numerous enslaved African Americans as workers.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Tennessee was occupied by Union troops from 1862. Franklin was the site of a major battle in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]]. The [[Second Battle of Franklin]] was fought on November 30, 1864, resulting in almost 10,000 casualties (killed, wounded, captured, and missing). Forty-four buildings were temporarily converted to use as [[field hospital]]s. The Carter, Carnton, and the [[Lotz House|Lotz]]<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref> plantation houses from this era are still standing and are among the city's numerous examples of historic architecture.\n\nAfter the war, there was considerable violence in this area as whites attempted to dominate the majority-black population of [[freedmen]] and assert [[white supremacy]].<ref name=\"nyt\"/> In 1866 the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a secret organization of insurgent white Confederate veterans, was founded in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]]. Soon it had chapters in many towns, including Franklin, as well as chapters in other Southern states.\n\nAfter Tennessee authorized African Americans to vote in February 1867, well before the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, most freedmen and formerly [[free people of color]] joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. White Democrats struggled to suppress their voting. For instance, on July 6, 1867, a political rally of [[Union League]] black Republicans in Franklin was disrupted by Conservatives, who were mostly white but included some blacks. Later that evening, what became known as the \"Franklin Riot\" broke out. Black Union League men were ambushed by whites at the town square and returned fire. An estimated 25 to 39 men were wounded, most of them black. One white man was killed outright, and at least three black people died of wounds soon after the confrontation.<ref name=\"memphisappeal\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"Riot at Franklin, Tennessee\"], ''Memphis Daily Appeal'', 9 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"nashville\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"Conservative Conciliation/The Ballot to be Controlled by the Bullet\"], ''Nashville Daily Press and Times'', July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"nyt\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"A Riot in Tennessee\"], ''New York Times'', 8 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref>\n\nOn August 15, 1868, in Franklin, [[Samuel Bierfield]] became the first Jewish man to be [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in the United States.

Five African Americans were lynched in Williamson County from 1877 to 1950, most during the decades around the turn of the century, a time of high social tensions and legal racial oppression in the South.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/Summary by County (3rd edition)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, p. 9, Equal Justice Initiative, 2017, Montgomery, Alabama</ref> Some of these murders took place in Franklin, when men were taken from the courthouse or county jail before trial.\n\nFor example, on August 10, 1888, [[Lynching of Amos Miller|Amos Miller]], a 23-year-old African American, was lynched before his trial.

Franklin's population has increased more than fivefold since 1980, when its population was 12,407.

The regional economy has also expanded, with considerable growth in businesses and jobs in Franklin and Williamson County.\n\nThe city's enhancement and preservation of its historic assets has helped attract new residents and tourists. This work in the historic preservation movement was catalyzed by passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966. City residents have worked to identify and preserve its most significant historic assets. Five [[historic districts]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as are many individual buildings.\n\nIn the early 21st century, leaders of historic preservation and city churches have worked to recognize the lives and contributions of African Americans to Franklin and the area. Since the 2015 [[Charleston church shooting]] in South Carolina and the 2017 [[Charlottesville car attack]] at a protest in Virginia, four local leaders developed a proposal for the \"Fuller Story\" as a project of Franklin public history. This is a series of historical plaques to be placed at the courthouse square to enlarge the history represented there. For instance, the square is known by many as the site of a former slave market in the antebellum years, when slavery was central to Middle Tennessee society, but there has been no official acknowledgement of this past.\n\nA Confederate memorial was installed in the early 20th century by conservative whites, who have largely controlled the local memorialization of the [[American Civil War]]. As part of the \"Fuller Story,\" a statue of a soldier of the [[United States Colored Troops]], to mark the contributions of African Americans in ending the war, reuniting the Union, and gaining their emancipation and franchise, is to be erected in 2019 in front of the old courthouse. This project was approved by the mayor and city council. In 2018 the first of the historic plaques was installed; these will mark the history of slavery, the [[Reconstruction era]] and [[Jim Crow]], and civil rights.<ref name=\"west\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2019/01/17/franklin-tn-confederate-statue-group-shares-slavery-civil-rights-history/2536980002/|title=National tragedies inspired group to tell history of slavery, civil rights in Franklin|last=West|first=Emily R.|work=The Tennessean|date=17 January 2019|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|107.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|106.8|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.6|sqkm|order=flip|1}}, or 0.52%, are covered by water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 1552\n|1880= 1632\n|1890= 2250\n|1900= 2180\n|1910= 2924\n|1920= 3123\n|1930= 3377\n|1940= 4120\n|1950= 5475\n|1960= 6977\n|1970= 9497\n|1980= 12407\n|1990= 20098\n|2000= 41842\n|2010= 62487\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80914\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|date=June 27, 2019|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR9\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-03-04|title=Census of Population and Housing: Decennial Censuses}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince the late 20th century, the city has grown rapidly in population, attracting many businesses.

All electoral offices are for four-year terms, with the ward alderman elected in one cycle, and the mayor and at-large aldermen elected two years later. The city's policies and procedures are decided by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.\n\nResolutions, municipal ordinances, and the municipal code are carried out by the city's various departments. These are: Administration, Building and Neighborhood Services, Engineering, Finance, Fire, Human Resources, Information Technology, Law, Planning and Sustainability, Parks, Police, Sanitation and Environmental Services, Streets, and Water Management.

In the 19th century, much of the area economy (especially the cultivation of tobacco and hemp) depended on enslaved labor. After Reconstruction, racial violence increased in this area, when whites worked to ensure dominance.<!-- Cited examples are given in body of article below, as well as for the noted lynchings --> As the county seat, Franklin was the site of several [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African-American men]] in this period. Franklin was a trading and judicial center for Williamson County, which was primarily rural in land use into the late 20th century, with an economy based on traditional commodity crops and purebred livestock.\n\nSince 1980, the northern part of the county has been developed for residential and related businesses, in addition to modern service industries. The population has increased rapidly, with growth stimulated by that of the Nashville metropolitan area. Despite recent growth and development, Franklin is noted for its many historic buildings and neighborhoods, which are protected by city ordinances.<ref>[https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2017/11/05/franklin-tennessee-preservation-heritage-foundation-carnton-plantation/764919001/ How Franklin has preserved history for 50 years] (''USA Today'')</ref>\n\nSince 2017, its two historic plantations have begun to provide extended tours including the antebellum history of enslaved workers at those sites.

Cameron was an immigrant, born February 23, 1768, in Bogallan, [[Ferintosh, Black Isle|Ferintosh]], [[Scotland]]. He immigrated to [[Virginia]] in 1785 and traveled into Tennessee along with other migrants after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. They displaced the indigenous tribes that had historically occupied this region. Cameron died on February 28, 1846, after living 48 years in the same house. He and his second wife, Mary, were buried in the old City Cemetery. Some of his descendants continue to live in Franklin.\n\n===19th century===\nThis area is part of [[Middle Tennessee]], and white planters prospered in the antebellum years, with cultivation of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and raising of purebred livestock. Many migrants came from central Kentucky, where they had raised these crops and livestock. Through the antebellum years, white farmers depended on numerous enslaved African Americans as workers.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Tennessee was occupied by Union troops from 1862. Franklin was the site of a major battle in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]]. The [[Second Battle of Franklin]] was fought on November 30, 1864, resulting in almost 10,000 casualties (killed, wounded, captured, and missing). Forty-four buildings were temporarily converted to use as [[field hospital]]s. The Carter, Carnton, and the [[Lotz House|Lotz]]<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref> plantation houses from this era are still standing and are among the city's numerous examples of historic architecture.\n\nAfter the war, there was considerable violence in this area as whites attempted to dominate the majority-black population of [[freedmen]] and assert [[white supremacy]].<ref name=\"nyt\"/> In 1866 the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a secret organization of insurgent white Confederate veterans, was founded in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]]. Soon it had chapters in many towns, including Franklin, as well as chapters in other Southern states.\n\nAfter Tennessee authorized African Americans to vote in February 1867, well before the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, most freedmen and formerly [[free people of color]] joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. White Democrats struggled to suppress their voting. For instance, on July 6, 1867, a political rally of [[Union League]] black Republicans in Franklin was disrupted by Conservatives, who were mostly white but included some blacks. Later that evening, what became known as the \"Franklin Riot\" broke out. Black Union League men were ambushed by whites at the town square and returned fire. An estimated 25 to 39 men were wounded, most of them black. One white man was killed outright, and at least three black people died of wounds soon after the confrontation.<ref name=\"memphisappeal\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"Riot at Franklin, Tennessee\"], ''Memphis Daily Appeal'', 9 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"nashville\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"Conservative Conciliation/The Ballot to be Controlled by the Bullet\"], ''Nashville Daily Press and Times'', July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"nyt\">[http://www.sitemason.com/files/gojWne/Frankin%20Reconstruction%20Teachers%20Guide.pdf \"A Riot in Tennessee\"], ''New York Times'', 8 July 1867; accessed 18 May 2018</ref>\n\nOn August 15, 1868, in Franklin, [[Samuel Bierfield]] became the first Jewish man to be [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in the United States.

Five African Americans were lynched in Williamson County from 1877 to 1950, most during the decades around the turn of the century, a time of high social tensions and legal racial oppression in the South.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America''/Summary by County (3rd edition)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063004/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |date=2017-10-23 }}, p. 9, Equal Justice Initiative, 2017, Montgomery, Alabama</ref> Some of these murders took place in Franklin, when men were taken from the courthouse or county jail before trial.\n\nFor example, on August 10, 1888, [[Lynching of Amos Miller|Amos Miller]], a 23-year-old African American, was lynched before his trial.

Franklin's population has increased more than fivefold since 1980, when its population was 12,407.

The regional economy has also expanded, with considerable growth in businesses and jobs in Franklin and Williamson County.\n\nThe city's enhancement and preservation of its historic assets has helped attract new residents and tourists. This work in the historic preservation movement was catalyzed by passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966. City residents have worked to identify and preserve its most significant historic assets. Five [[historic districts]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as are many individual buildings.\n\nIn the early 21st century, leaders of historic preservation and city churches have worked to recognize the lives and contributions of African Americans to Franklin and the area. Since the 2015 [[Charleston church shooting]] in South Carolina and the 2017 [[Charlottesville car attack]] at a protest in Virginia, four local leaders developed a proposal for the \"Fuller Story\" as a project of Franklin public history. This is a series of historical plaques to be placed at the courthouse square to enlarge the history represented there. For instance, the square is known by many as the site of a former slave market in the antebellum years, when slavery was central to Middle Tennessee society, but there has been no official acknowledgement of this past.\n\nA Confederate memorial was installed in the early 20th century by conservative whites, who have largely controlled the local memorialization of the [[American Civil War]]. As part of the \"Fuller Story,\" a statue of a soldier of the [[United States Colored Troops]], to mark the contributions of African Americans in ending the war, reuniting the Union, and gaining their emancipation and franchise, is to be erected in 2019 in front of the old courthouse. This project was approved by the mayor and city council. In 2018 the first of the historic plaques was installed; these will mark the history of slavery, the [[Reconstruction era]] and [[Jim Crow]], and civil rights.<ref name=\"west\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2019/01/17/franklin-tn-confederate-statue-group-shares-slavery-civil-rights-history/2536980002/|title=National tragedies inspired group to tell history of slavery, civil rights in Franklin|last=West|first=Emily R.|work=The Tennessean|date=17 January 2019|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|107.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|106.8|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.6|sqkm|order=flip|1}}, or 0.52%, are covered by water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 1552\n|1880= 1632\n|1890= 2250\n|1900= 2180\n|1910= 2924\n|1920= 3123\n|1930= 3377\n|1940= 4120\n|1950= 5475\n|1960= 6977\n|1970= 9497\n|1980= 12407\n|1990= 20098\n|2000= 41842\n|2010= 62487\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80914\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|date=June 27, 2019|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR9\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-03-04|title=Census of Population and Housing: Decennial Censuses}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince the late 20th century, the city has grown rapidly in population, attracting many businesses.

In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Violence against women : an EU-wide survey : main results|others=European Union.

Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the \"lady\", the \"flirt\", and the \"tomboy\".\nThe \"ladies\" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the \"ladies\" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\">{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe \"flirts\" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments.

They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a \"thick skin\". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/>\n\nThe findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/> For example, after an anti-groping device allowing victims to mark their assailants with an invisible ink stamp has been released in Japan, some experts claimed it is wrong to put the onus on the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|title=Anti-groping stamp lets victims mark assailants|last=|first=|date=29 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902031332/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|archive-date=2 September 2019|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Common effects on the victims===\n{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}\n\nCommon psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:\n* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people \"evaluate\" the victim to establish if he or she is \"worth\" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)\n* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip\n* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions;

This law, consisting of ten sections, provides for a clear definition of work, education or training-related sexual harassment and specifies the acts constituting sexual harassment. It likewise provides for the duties and liabilities of the employer in cases of sexual harassment, and sets penalties for violations of its provisions. A victim of sexual harassment is not barred from filing a separate and independent action for damages and other relief aside from filing the charge for sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |title = Republic Act No. 7877 Anti Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 |website = Filipiniana.net |access-date=2012-10-07 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120713063240/http://filipiniana.net/read_content.jsp?filename=L00000000018 |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===United States===\n\n====Evolution of sexual harassment law====\n\n=====Workplace=====\n{{main|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}\n\nIn the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[color]], [[national origin]] or [[religion]]. Initially intended to only combat sexual harassment of women, {42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2} the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers men and women. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n''[[Barnes v.

Saxbe]]'' established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v.

The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name=\"eeoc\"/> In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,\n# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or\n# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\n1. and 2. are called \"[[quid pro quo]]\" (Latin for \"this for that\" or \"something for something\"). They are essentially \"sexual bribery\", or promising of benefits, and \"sexual coercion\".\n\nType 3. known as \"[[hostile work environment]]\", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name=\"webcom\" />\n\n'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a \"right to sue\" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====\n[[File:Stop \u00e0 la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]\n\nQuid pro quo means \"this for that\". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|archive-date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both \"serious\" and \"frequent.\" Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802171805/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|archive-date=August 2, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThe line between \"[[quid pro quo]]\" and \"hostile environment\" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|title=Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=19 March 1990|website=|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910004803/https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|archive-date=10 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Hostile environment\" harassment may acquire characteristics of \"quid pro quo\" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred.\"</blockquote>\n\n=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814110642/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those \"with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender\", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.\n\n=====Retaliation=====\nRetaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment\u2014any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \"reasonable worker\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.\n\n=====New Jersey=====\nNew Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct.

In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Violence against women : an EU-wide survey : main results|others=European Union.

Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the \"lady\", the \"flirt\", and the \"tomboy\".\nThe \"ladies\" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the \"ladies\" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\">{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe \"flirts\" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments. Consequently, they became perceived as the \"embodiment of the female stereotype,...as particularly lacking in potential and were given the fewest opportunities to develop job skills and to establish social and self-identities as miners.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Landrine|first=Hope|title=Discrimination against women : prevalence, consequences, remedies|last2=Klonoff|first2=Elizabeth|date=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-0954-0|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=|oclc=36548828}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe \"tomboys\" were generally single women, but were older than the \"flirts\". They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a \"thick skin\". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/>\n\nThe findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/> For example, after an anti-groping device allowing victims to mark their assailants with an invisible ink stamp has been released in Japan, some experts claimed it is wrong to put the onus on the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|title=Anti-groping stamp lets victims mark assailants|last=|first=|date=29 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902031332/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|archive-date=2 September 2019|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Common effects on the victims===\n{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}\n\nCommon psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:\n* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people \"evaluate\" the victim to establish if he or she is \"worth\" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)\n* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip\n* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions;

The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name=\"eeoc\"/> In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,\n# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or\n# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\n1. and 2. are called \"[[quid pro quo]]\" (Latin for \"this for that\" or \"something for something\"). They are essentially \"sexual bribery\", or promising of benefits, and \"sexual coercion\".\n\nType 3. known as \"[[hostile work environment]]\", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name=\"webcom\" />\n\n'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a \"right to sue\" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====\n[[File:Stop \u00e0 la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]\n\nQuid pro quo means \"this for that\". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|archive-date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=|website=Sexual Harassment Support|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402083730/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|archivedate=2 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====\n{{Main|Hostile work environment}}\n\nThis occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both \"serious\" and \"frequent.\" Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802171805/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|archive-date=August 2, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThe line between \"[[quid pro quo]]\" and \"hostile environment\" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|title=Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=19 March 1990|website=|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910004803/https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|archive-date=10 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Hostile environment\" harassment may acquire characteristics of \"quid pro quo\" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred.\"</blockquote>\n\n=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814110642/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those \"with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender\", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.\n\n=====Retaliation=====\nRetaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment\u2014any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \"reasonable worker\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php|title=Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.\n\n=====New Jersey=====\nNew Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct. The Company would not be liable if they investigate the matter and take some remedial measures to make sure that the harassment stops. The Company only becomes liable if the activity occurs again.

Using [[Liu Hui's \u03c0 algorithm#Later developments|Liu Hui's algorithm]] (which is based on the areas of regular polygons approximating a circle), Zu famously computed {{pi}} to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 and gave two rational approximations of {{pi}}, {{sfrac|22|7}} and {{sfrac|355|113}}, naming them respectively Yuel\u00fc \u7ea6\u7387 (approximate ratio) and Mil\u00fc.\n\n{{sfrac|355|113}} is the best [[rational number|rational]] approximation of {{pi}} with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to 6 decimal places. It is within 0.000009% of the value of {{pi}}, or in terms of common fractions overestimates {{pi}} by less than {{sfrac|1|{{val|3748629}}}}. The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of {{pi}} is {{sfrac|{{val|52163}}|{{val|16604}}}}, still only correct to 6 decimal places and hardly closer to {{pi}} than {{sfrac|355|113}}. To be accurate to 7 decimal places, one needs to go as far as {{sfrac|{{val|86953}}|{{val|27678}}}}. For 8, {{sfrac|{{val|102928}}|{{val|32763}}}} is needed.\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\\pi & \\approx 3.141\\ 592\\ 653\\ 5\\dots \\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{355}{113} & \\approx 3.141\\ 592\\ 920\\ 3\\dots \\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{52163}{16604} & \\approx 3.141\\ 592\\ 387\\ 4\\dots \\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{86953}{27678} & \\approx 3.141\\ 592\\ 600\\ 6\\dots\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe accuracy of Mil\u00fc to the true value of {{Pi}} can be explained using the [[Continued fraction#Continued fraction expansions of .CF.80|continued fraction expansion of {{Pi}}]], the first few terms of which are <math>[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, ...]</math>.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

It was the first film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[57th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. [[All-High Stadium]], also in Buffalo, stood in for [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] in a key scene.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s Nebraska, young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father, who suffers an early fatal heart attack near an oak tree. When lightning strikes that same tree, splintering it, Hobbs makes a baseball bat from the wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name \u201cWonderboy\u201d into the barrel.\n\nNow 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the [[Chicago Cubs]], leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. En route on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer the \u201cWhammer\u201d and sportswriter Max Mercy. On a stopover at a carnival, Hobbs wins a bet to strike out Whammer on three pitches. The feat catches the attention of Harriet Bird, a mysterious woman also traveling on the train who was previously fawning over Whammer.\n\nIn Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. She asks if Hobbs's claim that he can be \u201cthe best there ever was,\u201d is true, and he confidently avers it is. Harriet aims a handgun at Hobbs and shoots him in the abdomen. It is learned that Harriet, who commits suicide, previously targeted other top athletes.\n\nIn 1939, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the New York Knights, a struggling ball club sitting in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was recruited, believing him too old. He initially refuses to play Hobbs but finally relents. At his first batting practice, Hobbs amazes the entire team with his powerful hitting. The following game, Pop benches star outfielder Bump Bailey after a reckless play. Pop [[pinch hit]]s with Hobbs, who literally knocks the baseball's cover off. Shortly after, Bailey tragically dies crashing through an outfield wall, resulting in Hobbs being made starting outfielder. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights\u2019 fortunes turn around. Mercy finds Hobbs to be familiar but fails to recognize him as the pitcher who once struck out the Whammer.\n\nAssistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, then his Knight's ownership share will revert to the team's majority owner, the Judge. Pop will permanently be out of the sport. Hobbs privately meets with the Judge who offers him $5,000 to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe.\n\nMercy introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie whom Hobbs learns places large bets against him. He also meets Pop's niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding relationship results in a distracted Hobbs\u2019 game slumping. Pop privately cautions Hobbs about Memo, who appears to be working for the Judge, though Hobbs dismisses his concerns.\n\nHobbs' slump continues until a game against the Cubs at [[Wrigley Field]], during which a woman in white stands up in the bleachers, catching Hobbs\u2019 attention. He then hits a home run, shattering the clock on the scoreboard. He realizes the woman is Iris, and the two later meet at a diner. They discuss their respective lives, though Hobbs avoids mentioning what happened to him. When they meet the next day, Hobbs tells Iris the truth. Iris, who is unmarried and works in [[Chicago]], shares that she has a son whose father lives in [[New York City]]. The reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. During a practice session, Mercy watches Hobbs pitching and suddenly remembers him.\n  \nAt a team party, Hobbs collapses in pain and awakens in a hospital. A silver bullet removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage that could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball. He learns the Knights have since lost three games in a row, which sets up a one-game playoff against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Memo visits Hobbs in the hospital and urges him to accept the Judge's bribe, which has been quadrupled, and to walk away. The Judge tells Hobbs to consider his offer and threatens to publicly expose Hobbs' past and reveals that another team member is being bribed. Hobbs again rejects the Judge's offer. When Iris visits Hobbs, she assures him he has not wasted his potential and is a great ballplayer.\n\nHobbs, still recovering, returns to the team wanting to play. Pop tells Hobbs that he is the best player he has ever seen and says to suit up. As the game progresses, Hobbs realizes that Knights pitcher Al Fowler is the bribed player. Hobbs confronts Fowler on the field, warning him not to throw the game. Fowler starts pitching competitively and the Knights stay in the game. Watching from the stands with her son, Iris begs an usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout, telling him that she has brought their son to watch him play.\n\nIn the ninth inning, the Knights trail the Pirates when the latter brings in a young, hard-throwing pitcher. Seeing that Hobbs is hampered by his old wound, the pitcher throws inside trying to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul but has struck the ball so hard that his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. Hobbs asks Bobby the bat boy to pick a replacement. Bobby brings him his own bat, the \u201cSavoy Special\u201d, that Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, hits the ball, smashing it into the stadium lights, winning the game and the National League pennant. The Knights advance to the World Series, though the outcome is not revealed. \n\nThe victory secures Pop's share of the team and his place on it. At the end, Hobbs is seen playing catch with his son in the same field that he and his father played in many years earlier, while Iris looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Roy Hobbs\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Max Mercy\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Iris Gaines\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Memo Paris\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Pop Fisher\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Harriet Bird\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as The Judge\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Red Blow\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as \"The Whammer\"\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Gus Sands (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey\n* [[John P.

It was the first film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[57th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. [[All-High Stadium]], also in Buffalo, stood in for [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] in a key scene.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s Nebraska, young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father, who suffers an early fatal heart attack near an oak tree. When lightning strikes that same tree, splintering it, Hobbs makes a baseball bat from the wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name \u201cWonderboy\u201d into the barrel.\n\nNow 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the [[Chicago Cubs]], leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. En route on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer the \u201cWhammer\u201d and sportswriter Max Mercy. On a stopover at a carnival, Hobbs wins a bet to strike out Whammer on three pitches. The feat catches the attention of Harriet Bird, a mysterious woman also traveling on the train who was previously fawning over Whammer.\n\nIn Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. She asks if Hobbs's claim that he can be \u201cthe best there ever was,\u201d is true, and he confidently avers it is. Harriet aims a handgun at Hobbs and shoots him in the abdomen. It is learned that Harriet, who commits suicide, previously targeted other top athletes.\n\nIn 1939, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the New York Knights, a struggling ball club sitting in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was recruited, believing him too old. He initially refuses to play Hobbs but finally relents. At his first batting practice, Hobbs amazes the entire team with his powerful hitting. The following game, Pop benches star outfielder Bump Bailey after a reckless play. Pop [[pinch hit]]s with Hobbs, who literally knocks the baseball's cover off. Shortly after, Bailey tragically dies crashing through an outfield wall, resulting in Hobbs being made starting outfielder. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights\u2019 fortunes turn around. Mercy finds Hobbs to be familiar but fails to recognize him as the pitcher who once struck out the Whammer.\n\nAssistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, then his Knight's ownership share will revert to the team's majority owner, the Judge. Pop will permanently be out of the sport. Hobbs privately meets with the Judge who offers him $5,000 to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe.\n\nMercy introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie whom Hobbs learns places large bets against him. He also meets Pop's niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding relationship results in a distracted Hobbs\u2019 game slumping. Pop privately cautions Hobbs about Memo, who appears to be working for the Judge, though Hobbs dismisses his concerns.\n\nHobbs' slump continues until a game against the Cubs at [[Wrigley Field]], during which a woman in white stands up in the bleachers, catching Hobbs\u2019 attention. He then hits a home run, shattering the clock on the scoreboard. He realizes the woman is Iris, and the two later meet at a diner. They discuss their respective lives, though Hobbs avoids mentioning what happened to him. When they meet the next day, Hobbs tells Iris the truth. Iris, who is unmarried and works in [[Chicago]], shares that she has a son whose father lives in [[New York City]]. The reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. During a practice session, Mercy watches Hobbs pitching and suddenly remembers him.\n  \nAt a team party, Hobbs collapses in pain and awakens in a hospital. A silver bullet removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage that could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball. He learns the Knights have since lost three games in a row, which sets up a one-game playoff against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Memo visits Hobbs in the hospital and urges him to accept the Judge's bribe, which has been quadrupled, and to walk away. The Judge tells Hobbs to consider his offer and threatens to publicly expose Hobbs' past and reveals that another team member is being bribed. Hobbs again rejects the Judge's offer. When Iris visits Hobbs, she assures him he has not wasted his potential and is a great ballplayer.\n\nHobbs, still recovering, returns to the team wanting to play. Pop tells Hobbs that he is the best player he has ever seen and says to suit up. As the game progresses, Hobbs realizes that Knights pitcher Al Fowler is the bribed player. Hobbs confronts Fowler on the field, warning him not to throw the game. Fowler starts pitching competitively and the Knights stay in the game. Watching from the stands with her son, Iris begs an usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout, telling him that she has brought their son to watch him play.\n\nIn the ninth inning, the Knights trail the Pirates when the latter brings in a young, hard-throwing pitcher. Seeing that Hobbs is hampered by his old wound, the pitcher throws inside trying to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul but has struck the ball so hard that his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. Hobbs asks Bobby the bat boy to pick a replacement. Bobby brings him his own bat, the \u201cSavoy Special\u201d, that Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, hits the ball, smashing it into the stadium lights, winning the game and the National League pennant. The Knights advance to the World Series, though the outcome is not revealed. \n\nThe victory secures Pop's share of the team and his place on it. At the end, Hobbs is seen playing catch with his son in the same field that he and his father played in many years earlier, while Iris looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Roy Hobbs\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Max Mercy\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Iris Gaines\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Memo Paris\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Pop Fisher\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Harriet Bird\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as The Judge\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Red Blow\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as \"The Whammer\"\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Gus Sands (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey\n* [[John P.
