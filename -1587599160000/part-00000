Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is\ndeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\"/> The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of\ncreating ''head-of-hollow-fills'', or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029154012/http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archivedate=2005-10-29|title=Mountain Justice Summer \u2013 What is Mountain Top Removal Mining?|date=29 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Philadelphia, PA (2005). [http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/eis2005.htm \"Mountaintop mining/valley fills in Appalachia: Final programmatic environmental impact statement.\"]</ref>\n\nSpoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (''see'' [[retreat mining]]).<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\">{{cite web|title=Coal Mining.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels {{convert|150|to|200|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} wide and more than a half-mile (1&nbsp;km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Retreat mining]] is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980\u20132012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]\n[[File:Coal mine in Inner Mongolia 002.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[China]]]]\n[[File:Loy Yang open cut brown coal mine and dredgers.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[Australia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Major coal producing regions}}\nCoal is mined commercially in over 50 countries.

A lower cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs.\n\nNoise exposures vary depending on the method of extraction. For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88\u2013112 dBA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=ER|date=April 2004|title=Worker exposure and equipment noise in large surface coal mines.|url=|journal=Min Eng|volume=56|pages=49\u201354|via=}}</ref> Within longwall sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures.  Auxiliary fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within continuous mining sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1107.html|title=Summary of Longwall and Continuous Miner Section Noise Studies in Underground Coal Mines|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to adverse effects on workers' hearing. The use of [[administrative controls]] and [[engineering controls]] can be used to reduce noise exposures.\n\n===Dangers from mining waste===\nIn the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster]] in Wales, a colliery [[spoil tip]] collapsed, engulfing a school and killing 116 children and 28 adults. Other accidents involving coal waste include the [[Martin County coal slurry spill]] (USA, 2000) and the [[Obed Mountain coal mine spill]] (Canada, 2013).\n\n===Safety Improvements===\n[[File:Make it Safer with Roof Screen.webm|thumb|A video on the use of roof screens in underground coal mines]]\nImprovements in mining methods (e.g. longwall mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as [[safety-lamp]]s or more modern electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|electrical equipment]], and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with [[gas engines]].<ref>[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/coal-gas/ Coal Gas Utilisation], www.clarke-energy.com</ref> Another innovation in recent years is the use of [[Self-contained self-rescue device|closed circuit escape respirator]]s, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/07/super-workplace/ |title = The Importance of Occupational Safety and Health: Making for a \"Super\" Workplace |date = 7 August 2013 |accessdate = 15 January 2015 |first1 = Jaclyn |last1 = Krah |first2 = Richard L. |last2 = Unger |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds.

An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html \"Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood.\"] ''Time'', 2 March 2007.</ref> Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is\ndeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\"/> The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of\ncreating ''head-of-hollow-fills'', or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029154012/http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archivedate=2005-10-29|title=Mountain Justice Summer \u2013 What is Mountain Top Removal Mining?|date=29 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Philadelphia, PA (2005). [http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/eis2005.htm \"Mountaintop mining/valley fills in Appalachia: Final programmatic environmental impact statement.\"]</ref>\n\nSpoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels {{convert|150|to|200|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} wide and more than a half-mile (1&nbsp;km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Retreat mining]] is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980\u20132012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]\n[[File:Coal mine in Inner Mongolia 002.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[China]]]]\n[[File:Loy Yang open cut brown coal mine and dredgers.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[Australia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Major coal producing regions}}\nCoal is mined commercially in over 50 countries.

An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html \"Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood.\"] ''Time'', 2 March 2007.</ref> Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

The Maple Leafs would win the best-of-seven series four games to three to win the [[Stanley Cup]], their third-straight championship.  As of 2019, this was the last time the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] had ended before the month of May. There would not be another game seven at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] for [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs|almost three decades]].\n\n==Paths to the Finals==\nToronto defeated the [[Montreal Canadiens]] 4\u20133 to advance to the finals and Detroit defeated the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] 4\u20133.\n\n==Game summaries==\nThis series is famous for the courageous play of [[Bobby Baun|Bob Baun]]. In game six of the Final, he took a [[Gordie Howe]] slapshot on his ankle and had to leave play. He returned in overtime and scored the winning goal. He also played in game seven despite the pain and only after the series was over, was it revealed that he had broken the ankle.\n\nUntil 2008\u201309 finals, [[John MacMillan]] was the only player to play in back-to-back finals with different teams in successive series that pitted the same teams against each other.  MacMillan won the Cup with the 1963 Toronto Maple Leafs in a five-game decision over Detroit, and then lost the 1964 Cup final to the Leafs as a member of the Red Wings.\n\n{{NHLPlayoffs\n|team1=Detroit Red Wings\n|team2=Toronto Maple Leafs\n|stadium1=[[Maple Leaf Gardens]]\n|stadium2=[[Olympia Stadium]]\n\n|date1       =April 11\n|home1       =1\n|score1      =2\u20133\n|won1        =2\n|recap1      =www.nhl.com/gamecenter/det-vs-tor/1964/04/11/1963030211#game=1963030211,game_state=final\n|1-1-1       =[[Bruce MacGregor]] (3) -

It is the second main entry in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and introduced [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], controllable by a second player. In the story, Sonic and Tails must stop series antagonist [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]] from stealing the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to power his [[space station]], the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991. The game was developed by both Japanese and American staff at [[Sega Technical Institute]]. The game was directed by Masaharu Yoshii and produced by [[Shinobu Toyoda]], with game design led by [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] and music composed by [[Masato Nakamura]]. Art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the new 3D special stages based on a [[tech demo]] created by [[Yuji Naka]]. The staff increased the speed of ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' in comparison to its predecessor.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' sold over six million copies, making it the second-bestselling Genesis game behind the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], it received acclaim for its level design, visuals and music, although its multiplayer mode was criticized. It has been rereleased on various platforms; a remastered version developed using the [[Retro Engine]] released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2013. Two direct sequels, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', were released in 1994.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Aquatic Ruins from Sonic 2 for Mega Drive.png|thumb|left|Sonic and Tails hopping across pillars in the third stage, Aquatic Ruin Zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGNWiiRev\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review |title=''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' Review |accessdate=January 28, 2019 |date=June 11, 2007 |first=Thomas |last=Lucas M. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref> The game stars [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], who is described as having idolized Sonic as a child and wanting to keep up with him.<ref name=\"m3\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3.</ref> At the game's start, the player can select to either play as Sonic, Tails, or both.

A second player can join in at any time and control Tails separately.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 7.</ref> The game takes place over a series of levels, each divided into one, two, or three acts with a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the last act. Certain levels have features that are unique to them; for example, Emerald Hill has corkscrew-like loops, and Chemical Plant has boost pads that instantly put Sonic at his top speed.<ref name=\"m3\"/> The character can jump on enemies to defeat them; the game also introduces a new move, the \"spin dash\" or \"Super Dash Attack\", by which the player curls in a ball and spins while stationary, resulting in a speed boost.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 6.</ref> When the player is attacked by an enemy without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the start of the act or from the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]].<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 9.</ref> Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]].<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sonic 2 SpecialStage.gif|thumb|right|The game's special stages, in which the player collects rings in hopes of obtaining a Chaos Emerald, are presented in 3D, unlike the rest of the game.]]\n\nWhen the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can warp to a \"special stage\".<ref name=stages>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Jared|title=A Guide to 'Sonic The Hedgehog' Version 2.0's Hidden Level-select, Debug Mode, and Many More Secrets|url=http://toucharcade.com/2013/05/27/a-guide-to-sonic-the-hedgehog-version-2-0s-hidden-level-select-debug-mode-and-many-more-secrets/|website=TouchArcade|publisher=[[Arnold Kim]]|accessdate=2014-11-16}}</ref> In these stages, the player runs through a pseudo-[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[half-pipe]] course, collecting rings and dodging bombs. A set amount of rings must be collected to pass through each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself. If Sonic collides with a bomb, he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily. The stages rise in difficulty, and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one. After finishing, the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage, with their ring-count reset to zero.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 17.</ref> When all Emeralds have been collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic by collecting 50 rings and jumping.<ref name=gameplay>{{cite web|last1=Creegan|first1=Dermot|title=Casual Monday: Sonic the Hedgehog 2|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/10/27/casual-monday-sonic-the-hedgehog-2/114175/|website=Hardcore Gamer|publisher=Disqus|accessdate=2014-11-16}}</ref><ref name=stages/> Super Sonic is invincible to attacks, runs faster, and jumps further; however, he loses one ring per second and reverts to regular Sonic when his rings are depleted.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\nThe game also has a competitive mode, where two players compete against each other to the finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held at the end of the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent will automatically win.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\n===''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2''===\n{{See also|Sonic &amp; Knuckles}}\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was released in 1994, two years after ''Sonic 2''. The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' [[ROM cartridge|game cartridge]] features a special \"lock-on\" port into which the player can insert other Genesis cartridges. Attaching ''Sonic 2'' unlocks ''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', a variation of ''Sonic 2'' whereby the player plays as [[Knuckles the Echidna]], a character introduced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and not playable until ''Sonic & Knuckles''.<ref name=lockon>{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=James|title=Sonic & Knuckles \"lock-on\" review|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/02/sonic_and_knuckles_virtual_console|website=NintendoLife|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2014-11-14}}</ref> Though the game is largely identical to ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Knuckles is able to glide and climb walls, allowing him access to areas previously inaccessible to Sonic or Tails. However, he cannot jump as high, making some parts of the game, such as certain boss fights, more difficult. In addition, Knuckles restarts with the amount of rings he collected at checkpoints (if he loses a life), the options are unavailable, the special stages have slightly fewer rings required to collect than before (for example, ten rings fewer than in the special stages with Sonic and Tails), and the two-player mode is removed.<ref name=lockon/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's premise is similar to that of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Sonic's nemesis, [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]], is planning world domination through the power of the [[Chaos Emeralds]] and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (an homage to the [[Death Star]]), also for the means of world domination.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe events of the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and eventually up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. The plane is damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant [[mech]]. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic falls to the ground and is saved by Tails in the Tornado. If the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic, in his [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] form, flies alongside it.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the release of the original ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', creator [[Yuji Naka]] quit [[Sega]] due to disagreements over corporate policy.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\">{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/06/developers-den-sega-technical-institute/|title=Developer's Den: Sega Technical Institute|work=Sega-16|date=2007-06-11|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref><ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|title=The Essential 50 Part 28 - Sonic the Hedgehog|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523204203/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|archivedate=May 23, 2011|accessdate=2014-07-21|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Mark Cerny]], who had recently founded [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI) in California, met with Naka in Japan and offered him a higher salary and more creative freedom if he joined STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Naka agreed, and [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]], the lead level designer of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', also decided to move to STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Yasuhara had been assigned to help Cerny establish STI in 1990, but the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]] delayed his move to the United States by three months, during which he joined [[Sonic Team]] and became part of the original ''Sonic'' project.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\">{{cite magazine|title=Sonic's Architect: GI Interviews Hirokazu Yasuhara|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=124|volume=13|date=August 2003|pages=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|title=Birth of a Hedgehog|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=211|volume=20|date=January 2007|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|page=72}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic 2'' began in November 1991, two months later than Cerny had intended, as Sega of America initially felt it was too soon for a sequel.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\" /> STI handled development;<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"gibehind\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=The Behind-The-Scenes Story Of How Sonic 2 Became Sega\u2019s Ace In The Hole|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/11/21/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-how-sonic-2-became-sega-ace-in-the-hole.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wrong\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=Where Sonic Went Wrong|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/11/09/where-sonic-went-wrong.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 14, 2006}}</ref> both American and Japanese staff contributed, although, according to team member Tim Skelly, \"Everyone attached to ''Sonic 2'' ultimately worked for Yuji Naka.

developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] console, released worldwide in November 1992. It is the second main entry in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and introduced [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], controllable by a second player. In the story, Sonic and Tails must stop series antagonist [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]] from stealing the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to power his [[space station]], the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991. The game was developed by both Japanese and American staff at [[Sega Technical Institute]]. The game was directed by Masaharu Yoshii and produced by [[Shinobu Toyoda]], with game design led by [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] and music composed by [[Masato Nakamura]]. Art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the new 3D special stages based on a [[tech demo]] created by [[Yuji Naka]]. The staff increased the speed of ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' in comparison to its predecessor.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' sold over six million copies, making it the second-bestselling Genesis game behind the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], it received acclaim for its level design, visuals and music, although its multiplayer mode was criticized. It has been rereleased on various platforms; a remastered version developed using the [[Retro Engine]] released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2013. Two direct sequels, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', were released in 1994.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Aquatic Ruins from Sonic 2 for Mega Drive.png|thumb|left|Sonic and Tails hopping across pillars in the third stage, Aquatic Ruin Zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGNWiiRev\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review |title=''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' Review |accessdate=January 28, 2019 |date=June 11, 2007 |first=Thomas |last=Lucas M. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=Ziff Davis}}</ref> The game stars [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his sidekick, [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], who is described as having idolized Sonic as a child and wanting to keep up with him.<ref name=\"m3\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3.</ref> At the game's start, the player can select to either play as Sonic, Tails, or both.

A set amount of rings must be collected to pass through each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself. If Sonic collides with a bomb, he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily. The stages rise in difficulty, and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one. After finishing, the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage, with their ring-count reset to zero.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 17.</ref> When all Emeralds have been collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic by collecting 50 rings and jumping.<ref name=gameplay>{{cite web|last1=Creegan|first1=Dermot|title=Casual Monday: Sonic the Hedgehog 2|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/10/27/casual-monday-sonic-the-hedgehog-2/114175/|website=Hardcore Gamer|publisher=Disqus|accessdate=2014-11-16}}</ref><ref name=stages/> Super Sonic is invincible to attacks, runs faster, and jumps further; however, he loses one ring per second and reverts to regular Sonic when his rings are depleted.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\nThe game also has a competitive mode, where two players compete against each other to the finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held at the end of the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent will automatically win.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\n===''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2''===\n{{See also|Sonic &amp; Knuckles}}\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was released in 1994, two years after ''Sonic 2''. The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' [[ROM cartridge|game cartridge]] features a special \"lock-on\" port into which the player can insert other Genesis cartridges. Attaching ''Sonic 2'' unlocks ''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', a variation of ''Sonic 2'' whereby the player plays as [[Knuckles the Echidna]], a character introduced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' and not playable until ''Sonic & Knuckles''.<ref name=lockon>{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=James|title=Sonic & Knuckles \"lock-on\" review|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/02/sonic_and_knuckles_virtual_console|website=NintendoLife|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2014-11-14}}</ref> Though the game is largely identical to ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Knuckles is able to glide and climb walls, allowing him access to areas previously inaccessible to Sonic or Tails. However, he cannot jump as high, making some parts of the game, such as certain boss fights, more difficult. In addition, Knuckles restarts with the amount of rings he collected at checkpoints (if he loses a life), the options are unavailable, the special stages have slightly fewer rings required to collect than before (for example, ten rings fewer than in the special stages with Sonic and Tails), and the two-player mode is removed.<ref name=lockon/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's premise is similar to that of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Sonic's nemesis, [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]], is planning world domination through the power of the [[Chaos Emeralds]] and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (an homage to the [[Death Star]]), also for the means of world domination.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe events of the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and eventually up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. The plane is damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant [[mech]]. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic falls to the ground and is saved by Tails in the Tornado. If the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic, in his [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] form, flies alongside it.<ref name=gameplay/>\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the release of the original ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', creator [[Yuji Naka]] quit [[Sega]] due to disagreements over corporate policy.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\">{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/06/developers-den-sega-technical-institute/|title=Developer's Den: Sega Technical Institute|work=Sega-16|date=2007-06-11|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref><ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|title=The Essential 50 Part 28 - Sonic the Hedgehog|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523204203/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-sonic|archivedate=May 23, 2011|accessdate=2014-07-21|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Mark Cerny]], who had recently founded [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI) in California, met with Naka in Japan and offered him a higher salary and more creative freedom if he joined STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Naka agreed, and [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]], the lead level designer of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', also decided to move to STI.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Yasuhara had been assigned to help Cerny establish STI in 1990, but the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]] delayed his move to the United States by three months, during which he joined [[Sonic Team]] and became part of the original ''Sonic'' project.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\">{{cite magazine|title=Sonic's Architect: GI Interviews Hirokazu Yasuhara|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=124|volume=13|date=August 2003|pages=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|title=Birth of a Hedgehog|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=211|volume=20|date=January 2007|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|page=72}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic 2'' began in November 1991, two months later than Cerny had intended, as Sega of America initially felt it was too soon for a sequel.<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\" /> STI handled development;<ref name=\"Sega-16 STI\"/><ref name=\"gibehind\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=The Behind-The-Scenes Story Of How Sonic 2 Became Sega\u2019s Ace In The Hole|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/11/21/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-how-sonic-2-became-sega-ace-in-the-hole.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wrong\">{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Brian|title=Where Sonic Went Wrong|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/11/09/where-sonic-went-wrong.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=November 14, 2006}}</ref> both American and Japanese staff contributed, although, according to team member Tim Skelly, \"Everyone attached to ''Sonic 2'' ultimately worked for Yuji Naka.

It all started with her desire to create a non-traditional, out of the box yet has social relevance, truthful, emotional and with \"real\" characters stories. The idea for the series was conceived when Doctolero began thinking about the question: \"What would you do if you find out that you husband is cheating on you... with another man?\" Although the idea is not-an-easy-story-to-tell because of its controversial theme which touches on the sensitive issue of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] relationships, Doctolero explained that \"the show is not all about the queerness of the characters but more of a love story and a family drama. When Doctolero presented the idea to [[GMA Network]], the management said \"yes\" easily because they found the concept interesting and \"it was based on the relatability of the masses to the topic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ph.omg.yahoo.com/news/gay-themed-tv-series-my-husbands-lover-gma-network-101705251.html|title=Is the Philippines ready for a gay-themed daily series?|publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

The purpose and function of the part in question depend on the instrument.\n\nOn instruments equipped with tuning machines such as [[guitar]]s or [[mandolin]]s, a key is part of a [[tuning machine]]. It is a worm gear with a key shaped end used to turn a cog, which, in turn, is attached to a post which winds the string. The key is used to make pitch adjustments to a string.\n\nWith other instruments, [[zither]]s and [[drum]]s, for example, a key is essentially a small wrench used to turn a tuning machine or lug.\n\nOn [[woodwind]] instruments such as a [[flute]] or [[saxophone]], keys are finger operated levers used to open or close [[tone hole]]s, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a [[pipe organ]] also open and close various valves, but the airflow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an [[accordion]] direct the air flow from  manually operated [[bellows]] across various tuned vibrating reeds.\n\nOn other [[keyboard instrument]]s, a key may be a lever which mechanically triggers a hammer to strike a group of strings, as on a [[piano]], or an [[electric switch]] which energizes an [[audio oscillator]] as on an [[electronic organ]] or a [[synthesizer]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Musical keyboard]]\n*[[Piano key frequencies]]\n\n{{Musical keyboards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Key (Instrument)}}\n[[Category:Human\u2013machine interaction]]\n[[Category:Musical instrument parts and accessories]]\n\n\n{{Musical-instrument-stub}}\n", "name_user": "2601:582:4800:4870:b11a:1077:575f:6294", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(instrument)"}
