A varying current in any one coil of the transformer produces a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core, which induces a varying [[electromotive force]] across any other coils wound around the same core.\nElectrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. [[Faraday's law of induction]], discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\n\nTransformers are most commonly used for increasing low [[Alternating current|AC]] voltages at high current (a step-up transformer) or decreasing high AC voltages at low current (a step-down transformer) in electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing circuits. Transformers can also be used for isolation, where the voltage in equals the voltage out, with separate coils not electrically bonded to one another.\n\nSince the invention of the first [[constant-potential transformer]] in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electric power.<ref name=\"Bedell (1942)\">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456|year=1942}}</ref> A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.

This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF, voltage) in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction and the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\n\nAccording to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of windings.

In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\">{{harvnb|McLaren|1984|pp=68\u201374}}</ref> Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\"/> Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\n\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.<ref name=\"calvert2001\">{{cite web| last = Calvert| first = James| title = Inside Transformers| publisher = University of Denver| year = 2001| url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| accessdate = May 19, 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509111407/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] vapor lamps and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>{{rp|485}}\n\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}</ref> A [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\n\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel.

This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.\n\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]], [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\n\n===Transformer EMF equation===\n{{anchor|Transformer universal EMF equation}}\nIf the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E''<sub>rms</sub> of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m<sup>2</sup> and peak magnetic flux density ''B''<sub>peak</sub> in Wb/m<sup>2</sup> or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>\n\n<math> E_\\text{rms} = {\\frac {2 \\pi f N a B_\\text{peak}} {\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx 4.44 f N a B_\\text{peak}</math>\n\n===Polarity===\nA [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a [[phasor]] diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\n\n===Effect of frequency===\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.<ref>{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}</ref> Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&nbsp;Hz and 25&nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\n\n[[File:Power Transformer Over-Excitation.gif|thumb|Power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core's magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).]]\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require [[protective relay]]s to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\n\nOne example is in traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&nbsp;kV).\n\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\n\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\n\n===Energy losses===\nTransformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses.

The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost.

These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-9\"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\n\n====Toroidal cores====\n[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-1\">{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|p=3-1}}</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> {{rp|485}} The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers.

An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.<ref>{{cite web| first = Reuben| last = Lee| title = Air-Core Transformers| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> Air cores are also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\n\n===Windings===\n[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]\n[[Image:transformer min stray field geometry.svg|thumb|left|Cut view through transformer windings.\nLegend: <br>\n'''White''': Air, liquid or other insulating medium <br>\n'''Green spiral''': [[Electrical steel|Grain oriented silicon steel]]<br>\n'''Black''': Primary winding <br>\n'''Red''': Secondary winding\n]]\nThe electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from [[enameled wire|enamelled magnet wire]]. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of [[Transformerboard|pressboard]].<ref name=\"CEGB1982\">{{harvnb|CEGB|1982||}}</ref>\n\nHigh-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided [[Litz wire]] to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.<ref name=\"dixon\">{{Cite conference | first = Lloyd| last = Dixon| book-title = Magnetics Design Handbook| title = Power Transformer Design| url = http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/slup126/slup126.pdf| year=2001| publisher = Texas Instruments}}</ref> Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/> Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/>\n\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\n\nPower-frequency transformers may have ''taps'' at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]]. Modulation transformers in [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] transmitters are very similar.\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Image:Drehstromtransformater im Schnitt Hochspannung.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cutaway view of liquid-immersed transformer.

Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\n\n===First alternating current transformers===\nBy the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.<ref name=maglab>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=Jan 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.

Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=Uppenborn1889/>\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[war of the currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name=\"Coltman1988\">{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan 1988|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Trafo1885.jpg|thumb|Shell form transformer.

A varying current in any one coil of the transformer produces a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core, which induces a varying [[electromotive force]] across any other coils wound around the same core.\nElectrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. [[Faraday's law of induction]], discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\n\nTransformers are most commonly used for increasing low [[Alternating current|AC]] voltages at high current (a step-up transformer) or decreasing high AC voltages at low current (a step-down transformer) in electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing circuits. Transformers can also be used for isolation, where the voltage in equals the voltage out, with separate coils not electrically bonded to one another.\n\nSince the invention of the first [[constant-potential transformer]] in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electric power.<ref name=\"Bedell (1942)\">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456|year=1942}}</ref> A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.

This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF, voltage) in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction and the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\n\nAccording to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of windings.

In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\">{{harvnb|McLaren|1984|pp=68\u201374}}</ref> Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\"/> Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\n\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.<ref name=\"calvert2001\">{{cite web| last = Calvert| first = James| title = Inside Transformers| publisher = University of Denver| year = 2001| url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| accessdate = May 19, 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509111407/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] vapor lamps and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>{{rp|485}}\n\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}</ref> A [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\n\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel.

This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.\n\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]], [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\n\n===Transformer EMF equation===\n{{anchor|Transformer universal EMF equation}}\nIf the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E''<sub>rms</sub> of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m<sup>2</sup> and peak magnetic flux density ''B''<sub>peak</sub> in Wb/m<sup>2</sup> or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>\n\n<math> E_\\text{rms} = {\\frac {2 \\pi f N a B_\\text{peak}} {\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx 4.44 f N a B_\\text{peak}</math>\n\n===Polarity===\nA [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a [[phasor]] diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\n\n===Effect of frequency===\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.<ref>{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}</ref> Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&nbsp;Hz and 25&nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\n\n[[File:Power Transformer Over-Excitation.gif|thumb|Power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core's magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).]]\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require [[protective relay]]s to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\n\nOne example is in traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&nbsp;kV).\n\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\n\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\n\n===Energy losses===\nTransformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses.

The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost.

These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-9\"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\n\n====Toroidal cores====\n[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-1\">{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|p=3-1}}</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> {{rp|485}} The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers.

An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.<ref>{{cite web| first = Reuben| last = Lee| title = Air-Core Transformers| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> Air cores are also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\n\n===Windings===\n[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]\n[[Image:transformer min stray field geometry.svg|thumb|left|Cut view through transformer windings.\nLegend: <br>\n'''White''': Air, liquid or other insulating medium <br>\n'''Green spiral''': [[Electrical steel|Grain oriented silicon steel]]<br>\n'''Black''': Primary winding <br>\n'''Red''': Secondary winding\n]]\nThe electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from [[enameled wire|enamelled magnet wire]]. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of [[Transformerboard|pressboard]].<ref name=\"CEGB1982\">{{harvnb|CEGB|1982||}}</ref>\n\nHigh-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided [[Litz wire]] to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.<ref name=\"dixon\">{{Cite conference | first = Lloyd| last = Dixon| book-title = Magnetics Design Handbook| title = Power Transformer Design| url = http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/slup126/slup126.pdf| year=2001| publisher = Texas Instruments}}</ref> Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/> Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/>\n\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\n\nPower-frequency transformers may have ''taps'' at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]]. Modulation transformers in [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] transmitters are very similar.\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Image:Drehstromtransformater im Schnitt Hochspannung.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cutaway view of liquid-immersed transformer.

Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\n\n===First alternating current transformers===\nBy the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.<ref name=maglab>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=Jan 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.

Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=Uppenborn1889/>\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[war of the currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name=\"Coltman1988\">{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan 1988|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Trafo1885.jpg|thumb|Shell form transformer.
