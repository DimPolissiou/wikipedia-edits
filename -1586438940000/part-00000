If a leader cannot sense fear in people around him, if a leader feels good when people around him are frightened into pretending, there is a problem. Power flows towards the leader or, rather, boss rather than towards the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/aT7rhh2W2zluIuWr5xJjdK/Devdutt-Pattanaiks-business-lessons-from-mythology.html|title=Devdutt Pattanaik's business lessons from mythology|first=Pooja|last=Singh|date=29 May 2016|website=Mint}}</ref>\n\nIn his book, '' ''Business Sutra: An Indian Approach to Management''<ref name=\"Devdutt\">{{Cite book|title=Business sutra : a very Indian approach to management|last=Devdutt|first=Pattanaik|isbn=9788192328072|location=New Delhi|oclc=859199033|year = 2013}}</ref>'', \"the central theme \u2026 is that when individual beliefs come into conflict with corporate beliefs, problems surface in organisations.

He notes that mythological fiction is very popular as it is fantasy rooted in familiar traditional tales. Mythology itself is about figuring out world views of cultures, essentially how people think in a particular cultural ethos. \"Most writers I know focus on mythological fiction. Study of mythology still remains rather academic\", Pattanaik told IANS in an interview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/mythological-fiction-and-mythology-are-different-devdutt-pattanaik-4791044/|title=Mythological fiction and mythology are different: Devdutt Pattanaik|date=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Performing Arts ===\nFocusing on Natyashastra, a Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts written by Bharata Muni, Devdutt has answered questions on the origins of the text and why it was referred to as the Panchama Veda. \"By dancing, Hindu Gods differentiated Hindu faith, they drew attention to time, space, rhythm, vibration and body\", explains Pattanaik.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/unwind/a-spin-on-mythology/articleshow/63871991.cms|title=A spin on mythology|website=Pune Mirror}}</ref>\n\nHe notices dance as part of religion. He speaks of how, over the years, the general gaze of looking at dance and dancers has changed. He states, \"Calling someone naachnewali or naachnewala has become a way of putting them down. We need to understand that dance is about seduction. For me, the story of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Mohini and dancing to seduce Bhasmasura is one of the most powerful stories. We don\u2019t understand that the story of Natraj also relates to seduction. But somehow, the word seduction has taken a negative connotation now. Through dance, we can understand a lot about Indian culture, history, geography and more. It\u2019s about time we did that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/pune/dance-is-about-seduction-devdutt-pattanaik/articleshow/63953021.cms|title=Dance is about seduction: Devdutt Pattanaik \u2013 Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\n=== Political Stance ===\nDevdutt is known to avoid partisan views and points to the strengths and weaknesses of the Left and the Right, the secular as well as religious, the capitalists and the communists, the patriarchs and the feminists, as indicated on his many articles on beef ban, vegetarianism, and Ramayana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devdutt.com/articles/hiss-of-the-pio-bharat-tyagi/|title=Hiss of the PIO Bharat Tyagi|date=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devdutt.com/articles/symbols-for-the-secular-tribe/|title=Symbols for the secular tribe|date=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-symbols-for-the-secular-tribe/17142156|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Symbols for the secular tribe|date=17 April 2016|website=mid-day}}</ref> He is wary of the influence of  'white saviours' on liberals as well as religious radicals.

If a leader cannot sense fear in people around him, if a leader feels good when people around him are frightened into pretending, there is a problem.

He notes that mythological fiction is very popular as it is fantasy rooted in familiar traditional tales. Mythology itself is about figuring out world views of cultures, essentially how people think in a particular cultural ethos. \"Most writers I know focus on mythological fiction. Study of mythology still remains rather academic\", Pattanaik told IANS in an interview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/mythological-fiction-and-mythology-are-different-devdutt-pattanaik-4791044/|title=Mythological fiction and mythology are different: Devdutt Pattanaik|date=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Performing Arts ===\nFocusing on Natyashastra, a Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts written by Bharata Muni, Devdutt has answered questions on the origins of the text and why it was referred to as the Panchama Veda. \"By dancing, Hindu Gods differentiated Hindu faith, they drew attention to time, space, rhythm, vibration and body\", explains Pattanaik.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/unwind/a-spin-on-mythology/articleshow/63871991.cms|title=A spin on mythology|website=Pune Mirror}}</ref>\n\nHe notices dance as part of religion. He speaks of how, over the years, the general gaze of looking at dance and dancers has changed. He states, \"Calling someone naachnewali or naachnewala has become a way of putting them down. We need to understand that dance is about seduction. For me, the story of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Mohini and dancing to seduce Bhasmasura is one of the most powerful stories. We don\u2019t understand that the story of Natraj also relates to seduction. But somehow, the word seduction has taken a negative connotation now. Through dance, we can understand a lot about Indian culture, history, geography and more. It\u2019s about time we did that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/pune/dance-is-about-seduction-devdutt-pattanaik/articleshow/63953021.cms|title=Dance is about seduction: Devdutt Pattanaik \u2013 Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\n=== Political Stance ===\nDevdutt is known to avoid partisan views and points to the strengths and weaknesses of the Left and the Right, the secular as well as religious, the capitalists and the communists, the patriarchs and the feminists, as indicated on his many articles on beef ban, vegetarianism, and Ramayana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devdutt.com/articles/hiss-of-the-pio-bharat-tyagi/|title=Hiss of the PIO Bharat Tyagi|date=2 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devdutt.com/articles/symbols-for-the-secular-tribe/|title=Symbols for the secular tribe|date=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-symbols-for-the-secular-tribe/17142156|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Symbols for the secular tribe|date=17 April 2016|website=mid-day}}</ref> He is wary of the influence of  'white saviours' on liberals as well as religious radicals.

It was released on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional, [[Volcano Entertainment]], and [[RCA Records]]. It is the band's first album in 13 years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since the release of ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''. The album was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers generally agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established sound. The album topped the US [[Billboard 200]] albums chart, their third album in a row to do so, selling over 270,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s. The album topped five other national album charts in its opening week as well. Two songs off the album received [[Grammy Nomination]]s, first single \"[[Fear Inoculum (song)|Fear Inoculum]]\", for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]], and album closer \"[[7empest]]\" (pronounced \"tempest\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/features/its-not-good-when-its-done-its-done-when-its-good-tool-on-the-13-year-wait-for-fear-inoculum/|title=\"It\u2019s Not Good When It\u2019s Done, It\u2019s Done When It\u2019s Good\": Tool On The 13 Year Wait For \u2018Fear Inoculum\u2019|date=2019-08-30|website=Music Feeds|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>, for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]. \u201c7empest\u201d would go on to win the [[Grammy Award]].\n\n==Background==\n===Writing===\nIn 2006, [[Tool (band)|Tool]] released their fourth studio album, ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''.<ref name=\"Billboard2006\"/> It topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], indicating more than one million units sold, a month later.<ref name=\"Billboard2006\">{{cite web |title=Hard Work Pays Off for Tool's 'Days' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58388/hard-work-pays-off-for-tools-days |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616020500/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58388/hard-work-pays-off-for-tools-days |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"plat1\">{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 Tool |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=tool#search_section |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref> The band toured heavily in support of the album, playing more than 200 shows through 2007.<ref name=\"LW1\">{{cite web |last1=Hartmann |first1=Graham |title=Why Has Tool's New Album Taken 13 Years to Make?

It was released on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional, [[Volcano Entertainment]], and [[RCA Records]]. It is the band's first album in 13 years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since the release of ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''. The album was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers generally agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established sound. The album topped the US [[Billboard 200]] albums chart, their third album in a row to do so, selling over 270,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s. The album topped five other national album charts in its opening week as well. Two songs off the album received [[Grammy Nomination]]s, first single \"[[Fear Inoculum (song)|Fear Inoculum]]\", for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]], and album closer \"[[7empest]]\" (pronounced \"tempest\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/features/its-not-good-when-its-done-its-done-when-its-good-tool-on-the-13-year-wait-for-fear-inoculum/|title=\"It\u2019s Not Good When It\u2019s Done, It\u2019s Done When It\u2019s Good\": Tool On The 13 Year Wait For \u2018Fear Inoculum\u2019|date=2019-08-30|website=Music Feeds|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>, for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]. \u201c7empest\u201d would go on to win the [[Grammy Award]].\n\n==Background==\n===Writing===\nIn 2006, [[Tool (band)|Tool]] released their fourth studio album, ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''.<ref name=\"Billboard2006\"/> It topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], indicating more than one million units sold, a month later.<ref name=\"Billboard2006\">{{cite web |title=Hard Work Pays Off for Tool's 'Days' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58388/hard-work-pays-off-for-tools-days |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616020500/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58388/hard-work-pays-off-for-tools-days |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"plat1\">{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 Tool |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=tool#search_section |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref> The band toured heavily in support of the album, playing more than 200 shows through 2007.<ref name=\"LW1\">{{cite web |last1=Hartmann |first1=Graham |title=Why Has Tool's New Album Taken 13 Years to Make?

I had to starve. Had no money. Marriage broke up. But I had to do what I'd wanted to do since I was 6... write music.\" Upon his return from Jerusalem, he contracted with lyricist Creed to work on the song and wrote it right from the heart.

To finish the EP, the fourth track was \"The Greatest Love of All\" by [[George Benson]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year<br /> Recording\n!Side\n!Song\n!Interpreter\n!Writer/Composer\n!Producer\n!Original Album\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[1977 in music|1977]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[A-side and B-side|A-side 1]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\"[[Float On (The Floaters song)|Float On]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[The Floaters]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Marvin Willis,<br /> James Mitchell, <br /> Arnold Ingram\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Marvin Willis,<br /> James Mitchell\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''[[Floaters (album)|Floaters]]''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[1977 in music|1977]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[A-side and B-side|A-side 2]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\"We Never Danced To a Love Song\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[The Manhattans]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Gerald Alston]],<br />Edward 'Sonny' Bivins\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[The Manhattans]],<br /> [[Bobby Martin (producer)|Bobby Martin]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''It Feels So Good''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[1977 in music|1977]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[A-side and B-side|B-side 1]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\"[[Strawberry Letter 23]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[The Brothers Johnson]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Shuggie Otis]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Quincy Jones]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''[[Right on Time (The Brothers Johnson album)|Right on Time]]''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[1977 in music|1977]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[A-side and B-side|B-side 2]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\"The Greatest Love of All\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[George Benson]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Michael Masser]], <br />[[Linda Creed]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Michael Masser]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[The Greatest (1977 soundtrack)|''The Greatest'' soundtrack]]\n|}\n\n==Whitney Houston version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Greatest Love of All\n| cover      = Whitney Houston \u2013 The Greatest Love of All.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Whitney Houston]]\n| album      = [[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]]\n| B-side     = [[Thinking About You (Whitney Houston song)|Thinking About You]]\n| released   = March 18, 1986\n| format     = {{flatlist|\n* [[Gramophone record|7\"]]\n* [[12-inch single|12\"]]\n* [[CD single|CD]]\n* [[Cassette single|cassette]]\n}}\n| recorded   = December 1984\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = {{flatlist|\n* [[Soul music|Soul]]\n* [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n}}\n| length     = 4:56 <small>(album version)</small><br />4:48 <small>(single version)</small>\n| label      = [[Arista Records|Arista]]\n| writer     = {{flatlist|\n* [[Michael Masser]]\n* [[Linda Creed]]\n}}\n| producer   = Michael Masser\n| prev_title = [[How Will I Know]]\n| prev_year  = 1985\n| next_title = [[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]\n| next_year  = 1987\n| misc       = \n}}\n\nThe song was further popularized by American singer [[Whitney Houston]] under the title '''\"Greatest Love of All,\"''' without the \"The\". In the Whitney Houston version of this song, the [[Yamaha DX7]] \"Electric Piano 1\" internal patch was heard. The song was recorded in December 1984 for her 1985 [[Whitney Houston (album)|self-titled]] debut studio [[album]]. The song became a major hit, topping the charts in Australia, Canada and the US, while reaching the top 20 in most countries, including Italy, Sweden and the UK. It remains her third biggest US hit, after \"[[I Will Always Love You#Whitney Houston version|I Will Always Love You]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/506203/whitney-houstons-biggest-billboard-hits-a-look-at-her-legendary-chart-career |title=Whitney Houston's Biggest Hits |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death in 2012, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431329/whitney+houston/chart |title=Whitney Houston - Chart history |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2017-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Clive Davis]], founder of Houston's label [[Arista Records]], was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]],'' but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the [[B-side]] to the single \"[[You Give Good Love]],\" a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song, eventually released as a single in its own right, on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in May of that year.<ref>[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003). ''The Billboard Book of No. 1 Hits'', 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 636.</ref>\n\nHouston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album and international releases.\n\nHer live performance in 1990 in ''[[That's What Friends Are For#1990 benefit concert|the 15th anniversary of Arista Records]]'' concert in [[Radio City Music Hall]] was included in the 25th anniversary deluxe edition of ''Whitney Houston'' and the 2014 CD/DVD release, ''[[Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances]].''<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-her-greatest-performances-mw0002759110 |title=Live: Her Greatest Performances - Whitney Houston &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\nWhitney Houston was still an unknown hopeful when the then-president of [[Arista Records]], [[Clive Davis]], and Masser heard her sing \"Greatest Love\" in a New York club on Amsterdam Avenue at about 68th St. a few years before her debut. Davis later described the first time he heard Houston sing:\n\n<blockquote>I went down there [Sweetwater's club] instead of having her audition in a studio; I was seeing her before an audience. She did backup singing and you could see she was a beautiful young girl. But then she stepped out and she did two solo numbers, one of which was the song \"The Greatest Love of All.\" Whitney sang the song with such fervor, with such a natural vocal gift, with such passion, that I was stunned. I knew really right then and there that this was a special talent and I was blown away by her. As I reflect back on this, I can relive the experience for the very first time. There was no hesitation. I wanted to sign Whitney.</blockquote>\n\nMasser said, \"When I first met Whitney, she was about 19 and unknown. I went into Sweetwater's, and I thought I must be totally out of it\u2014I said, 'I must be going crazy, I think I'm hearing one of my songs.' She was singing 'The Greatest Love of All' just as I walked in, and that meant something to me. Two and a half years later when I was doing [[Teddy Pendergrass]] there was a duet and everybody wanted me to use this or that known person. Only because I had heard Whitney singing 'The Greatest Love of All'. I chose her.\"<ref name=\"gloaocala\"/> (The eventual duet between Pendergrass and Houston to which Masser referred, which served as Houston's debut single, was titled \"[[Hold Me (Teddy Pendergrass & Whitney Houston song)|Hold Me in Your Arms]]\".)\n\n===Music video===\nHouston's music video was filmed at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City. In the video, she is a successful singer who is about to perform in front of an audience. She reminisces about the time when she was a child performing in a talent competition and receiving encouragement from her mother. The video features Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] playing herself, supporting a young Whitney, as well as hugging present Whitney at the end of the video. It was directed by Peter Israelson, filmed with James Contner as DP and Steadicam operator Robin Buerki shooting 35mm film. On February 2020, the music video was upscaled to [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref>[http://www.vevo.com/watch/whitney-houston/Greatest-Love-Of-All/USAV70000013 Whitney Houston - \"Greatest Love of All\"] on Vevo</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical reception====\nMany critics called the song the centerpiece of Houston's debut album. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"Houston sings it with a forceful directness that gives its message of self-worth an astounding resonance and conviction\" and called the song a compelling assertion of spiritual devotion, black pride, and family loyalty, all at once.<ref>Holden, Stephen. \"Whitney Houston \u2013 Pop's New Queen\". NY Times. March 18, 1986. Pg A18.</ref> Don Shewey of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that as the song builds, Houston \"slowly pours on the soul, slips in some churchy phrasing, holds notes a little longer and shows off her glorious voice.\"<ref>Shewey, Don.

It was a moderate pop hit, making the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Hyatt\">Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of number 1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications), page 306.</ref> Houston's version reached number one on the Hot 100 chart for three weeks in 1986. The single was the fourth hit (and third number 1) from her debut album. To date, this song was her second longest stay atop this chart, behind 1992's \"[[I Will Always Love You]].\" The song also reached number one on both component charts, the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] and the [[Hot 100 Airplay]], her second consecutive release to do so, and stayed for 14 weeks inside the top 40. On other ''Billboard'' charts, Houston also performed well, reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs|R&B chart]]. The song topped the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]] for five weeks, Houston's longest stay at the top of that chart at the time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/> The song ranked No. 11 on ''Billboard's'' year end pop singles chart.<ref>Top 20 Pop Singles for 1986. ''Newsday''. December 28, 1986. Pg 19.</ref> Houston's single fared well globally as well, reaching No. 8 in the United Kingdom and the top ten or No. 1 in several other European countries.

The song was written and recorded to be the main theme of the 1977 film ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]],'' a biopic of the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], and is performed during the opening credits.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KKedih-Ns ''The Greatest Love Of All'' by George Benson from the movie ''The Greatest'' (1977) on Youtube]</ref> Eight years after Benson's original recording, the song became even more well known for a version by [[Whitney Houston]], whose 1985 cover (with the slightly amended title \"Greatest Love of All\") eventually topped the charts, peaking at number one in the United States, Australia, Canada and on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in early 1986.\n\nThe original recording by Benson was released in 1977 in the United States, Japan, France, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Thailand, on an [[extended play]] (EP).<ref name=\"Floating Gold\">{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/tkr501 |accessdate=July 1, 2018 |title=Floating Gold - Various Artists (1977) |author=45cat}}</ref> He officially recorded the song four times; in addition to the studio single, Benson also recorded three live versions,<ref name=\"weekend\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weekend-in-la-mw0000652034 |accessdate=July 1, 2018 |title=George Benson \u2013 Weekend In L.A.

That's all. Ali hadn't believed in the war in Vietnam and had refused to fight in it. He won that battle through the legal system. Still, he lost everything\u2014including his title.

I had to starve. Had no money. Marriage broke up. But I had to do what I'd wanted to do since I was 6... write music.\" Upon his return from Jerusalem, he contracted with lyricist Creed to work on the song and wrote it right from the heart. Then Masser had George Benson perform the song for the soundtrack. He said, \"The record came out and the song became an underground theme for black people.\"<ref name=\"gloalatimes\"/><ref name=\"gloaocala\"/> He was later accused by [[Gordon Lightfoot]] of plagiarizing 24 bars of his 1971 hit \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\", but Lightfoot eventually dropped the suit out of respect for singer [[Whitney Houston]].\n\n==The George Benson version, 1977==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = The Greatest Love of All\n| cover      = Greatest love of all george benson vinyl.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = One of A-side track labels of the U.S. vinyl release\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[George Benson]]\n| album      = [[The Greatest (1977 soundtrack)|The Greatest {{no italic|soundtrack}}]]\n| B-side     = Ali's Theme\n| released   = June 1977\n| format     = [[7-inch single|7\" single]]\n| recorded   = 1977\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Smooth jazz]]|[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]|[[soul music|soul]]}}\n| length     = 5:32 (Album full version) <br />3:29 (Single edited version)\n| label      = [[Arista Records|Arista]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Michael Masser]]|[[Linda Creed]]}}\n| producer   = [[Michael Masser]]\n| prev_title = Gonna Love You More\n| prev_year  = 1977\n| next_title = [[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\n| next_year  = 1978\n| misc       = \n}}\n\nThe original version of \"The Greatest Love of All\" was recorded in 1977 by Benson and originally released on the [[The Greatest (1977 soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] for ''The Greatest.''

The song, eventually released as a single in its own right, on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in May of that year.<ref>[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003).

Davis later described the first time he heard Houston sing:\n\n<blockquote>I went down there [Sweetwater's club] instead of having her audition in a studio; I was seeing her before an audience. She did backup singing and you could see she was a beautiful young girl. But then she stepped out and she did two solo numbers, one of which was the song \"The Greatest Love of All.\" Whitney sang the song with such fervor, with such a natural vocal gift, with such passion, that I was stunned. I knew really right then and there that this was a special talent and I was blown away by her. As I reflect back on this, I can relive the experience for the very first time. There was no hesitation. I wanted to sign Whitney.</blockquote>\n\nMasser said, \"When I first met Whitney, she was about 19 and unknown. I went into Sweetwater's, and I thought I must be totally out of it\u2014I said, 'I must be going crazy, I think I'm hearing one of my songs.' She was singing 'The Greatest Love of All' just as I walked in, and that meant something to me. Two and a half years later when I was doing [[Teddy Pendergrass]] there was a duet and everybody wanted me to use this or that known person. Only because I had heard Whitney singing 'The Greatest Love of All'. I chose her.\"<ref name=\"gloaocala\"/> (The eventual duet between Pendergrass and Houston to which Masser referred, which served as Houston's debut single, was titled \"[[Hold Me (Teddy Pendergrass & Whitney Houston song)|Hold Me in Your Arms]]\".)\n\n===Music video===\nHouston's music video was filmed at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City. In the video, she is a successful singer who is about to perform in front of an audience. She reminisces about the time when she was a child performing in a talent competition and receiving encouragement from her mother. The video features Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] playing herself, supporting a young Whitney, as well as hugging present Whitney at the end of the video. It was directed by Peter Israelson, filmed with James Contner as DP and Steadicam operator Robin Buerki shooting 35mm film. On February 2020, the music video was upscaled to [[4K resolution|4K]]. <ref>[http://www.vevo.com/watch/whitney-houston/Greatest-Love-Of-All/USAV70000013 Whitney Houston - \"Greatest Love of All\"] on Vevo</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical reception====\nMany critics called the song the centerpiece of Houston's debut album. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"Houston sings it with a forceful directness that gives its message of self-worth an astounding resonance and conviction\" and called the song a compelling assertion of spiritual devotion, black pride, and family loyalty, all at once.<ref>Holden, Stephen. \"Whitney Houston \u2013 Pop's New Queen\". NY Times. March 18, 1986.

''The Billboard Book of number 1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications), page 306.</ref> Houston's version reached number one on the Hot 100 chart for three weeks in 1986. The single was the fourth hit (and third number 1) from her debut album. To date, this song was her second longest stay atop this chart, behind 1992's \"[[I Will Always Love You]].\" The song also reached number one on both component charts, the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] and the [[Hot 100 Airplay]], her second consecutive release to do so, and stayed for 14 weeks inside the top 40. On other ''Billboard'' charts, Houston also performed well, reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs|R&B chart]]. The song topped the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]] for five weeks, Houston's longest stay at the top of that chart at the time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/> The song ranked No. 11 on ''Billboard's'' year end pop singles chart.<ref>Top 20 Pop Singles for 1986.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.
