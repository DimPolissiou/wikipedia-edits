The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,<ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2002|p=16}}.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,<ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2002|p=16}}.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

The first step in the process was to remove the head and internal organs of the fish, which was then dried on a rack outside before being taken inside and smoked in the hearth. Trout (''{{lang|ain|icaniw}}'') and Japanese char (''{{lang|ain|tuksis}}'') caught in summer were dried over a fire to prevent flies damaging the fish. These dried fish were eaten as is by pulling off the meat, or by rehydrating in water and eating as ingredients in soup or as a final cooked item itself. Salmon that was dried after the fish had laid eggs lost much of its flavor, so it was often stewed with added fish fats to improve the taste.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|79-85}}\n\nMilt (''{{lang|ain|up}}'') and salmon roe (''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'') obtained when slicing open the fish were also dried and preserved then later used in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' or to make stock for ''{{lang|ain|ohaw}}''.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|157-158}}\n\nWhile it was common to eat everything of a bear raw while it was still fresh, including its meat and its internal organs, the Ainu would also preserve some of the meat for consumption during the off season. Meat from deer (''{{lang|ain|yuk}}'') and brown bears (''{{lang|ain|kimun kamuy}}'') was cut into narrow strips and simmered in a large pot.

Grind until a sticky paste is formed using the head of a hatchet as a pestle. Pour large quantities of water into the bucket and let sit for about two days.\n# Fine fibers and skins will float to the surface of the water forming a scum after a few days have passed and the starch will settle to the bottom. The fibrous scum is removed and set aside for use in on turep. The starch collected on the bottom of the bucket is divided into two types of starch: the semi-liquid secondary starch and the powdered primary starch.\n\nThese two types of starch were dried and preserved, but before that, they were also used to make fresh foods. The primary starch was mixed with water and poured into the hollow of plant stems from the Japanese knotweed (''{{lang|ain|kuttar}}'') or ''[[Parasenecio hastatus]]'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and placed into the ashes of a fire to cook into a thin noodle-like shape. The secondary starch was formed into round dumplings, wrapped in the leaves of the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or magnolia (''{{lang|ain|pusni}}''), then placed in the ashes of a fire to bake. They were then eaten with salmon roe or animal fats.\n\nThe secondary starch was the one which was used on a daily basis once it had been dried for preservation. It was often formed into dumplings and added to ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''. The primary starch was rarely eaten, instead being reserved for gifts or used as medicine.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|188}}\n\nIt was considered taboo to speak of alcohol or love affairs while working on any part of the starch making process.

It was made using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|201}}\n\n# An ''{{lang|ain|icari}}'' (sieve) is used to gather the fiber and skins that float in or on the water after the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' bulbs have been crushed and soaked in water.\n# The water is thoroughly wrung from the fiber, then it is wrapped in leaves from the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or ''Parasenecio hastatus'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and left to ferment for three to ten days.

Once pounded, it is kneaded, formed into donut-like shapes, and dried.\n# A cord is passed through the center and the ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' is stored hung from a rack above the hearth.\n\nThe ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' was eaten by smashing and rehydrating it to form into dumplings and placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''.\n\n===''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}'' is a preserved potato food also known as ''{{lang|ain|penekoshoi-imo}}'' or ''{{lang|ain|munini-imo}}''. The process involved uses the extreme cold of Hokkaid\u014d in a fashion similar to the production of [[chu\u00f1o]] in South America.\n\nOnce potatoes were harvested in the fall, the poorly shaped and small potatoes were left outside. The winter\u2019s cold would soon come and freeze the potatoes, which would thaw again in spring. This process of freezing and thawing would break down the structure of the potatoes, turning them soft. Once in that state, the potatoes were soaked in water and thawed completely.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"ainunorekishi2007\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{expand Japanese|\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6599\u7406|date=March 2013}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n{{cleanup lang|date=May 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:Ainu ohaw.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ohaw]], traditional Ainu soup]]\n'''Ainu cuisine''' is the [[cuisine]] of the ethnic [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in [[Japan]].

Beans are boiled until soft, then angelica is added and further boiled. Finally, it is seasoned with animal and fish fats.\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Kabocha rataskep}}'''''\n\n:Beans are boiled until soft. Dried strips of pumpkin (''{{lang|ain|kabocha}}'') are rehydrated in water then boiled along with the beans. Once the pumpkin begins to break apart, the ''{{lang|ain|rataskep}}'' is seasoned with fish fats and salt and topped with berries from the Amur corktree (''{{lang|ain|sikerpe}}'').\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Cipor rataskep}}'''''\n\n:Also called ''{{lang|ain|cipor imo}}''. Potatoes (''{{lang|ain|imo}}'') are boiled with skin on. Salmon roe (''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'') is placed in a separate pot and cooked over low heat until it starts to break down. The skin is removed from the cooked potatoes and they are sliced thickly before placing into the pot with the salmon roe. Salt is added and everything is mixed well.\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Nisew rataskep}}'''''\n\n:The hull is removed from acorns (''{{lang|ain|nisew}}'') which are then boiled and drained multiple times with the seed coat on to remove the bitter taste. They are then placed in water with beans and boiled together. The resulting broth is discarded. The water is replaced and the mixture is boiled further until soft, at which point corn flour is added. It is cooked to the desired consistency. Rice flour is added, the mixture is kneaded, and salt and animal fats are added for seasoning.\n\n==={{lang|ain|Sayo}}===\n\nA thin porridge made from boiling Japanese millet or rice. Generally, the grains are boiled alone, but occasionally gathered vegetables are added. Unlike other porridges in agricultural societies, ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' is not a staple food. Rather, Ainu would fill up on fatty soups and grilled meats then drink it like tea as a palate cleanser.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\"/>{{rp|37\u201339}} For that reason, ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' was made in a small dedicated pot so as to avoid mixing oils in from other dishes. Care was also taken to avoid mixing flavors when serving by using a separate ladle specifically for serving ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' (''{{lang|ain|sayo kasup}}''), rather than the usual ladle for serving soup (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'').<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406\u2013420}} As the porridge used very little grains to make, a month's supply for one person was approximately 1.8 liters. 108 liters would provide plenty for a family of five for a year.<ref name=\"ainuonoukou1969\">{{cite book |last1=\u6797\u559c |first1=\u8302 |title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u8fb2\u8015\u6587\u5316 |date=1969 |publisher=\u6176\u53cb\u793e |asin=B000J9W90Q}}</ref>{{rp|158}}\n\nThe following are examples of {{lang|ain|sayo}} varieties.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\"/>{{rp|37\u201339}}\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Turep sayo}}'''''\n\n:''{{lang|ain|Sayo}}'' which contains ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'', the fermented remains from the process of making ''cardiocrinum cordatum'' (''{{lang|ain|turep}}'') starch. The hard dried ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' is first ground with mortar and pestle, then rehydrated in water. The sediment is removed from the water then formed into dumplings approximately three centimeters in diameter, and cooked in the ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''. ''{{lang|ain|Sayo}}'' which contains the ''cardiocrinum cordatum'' bulbs themselves is also called ''{{lang|ain|turep sayo}}''.\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Irup sayo}}'''''\n\n:The starch from ''cardiocrinum cordatum'' bulbs is made into dumplings (''{{lang|ain|sito}}'') and placed in the ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''.\n\n'''''{{lang|ain|Ento sayo}}'''''\n\n:''{{lang|ain|Sayo}}'' which contains ''[[elsholtzia ciliata]]'' (''{{lang|ain|ento}}''), a mountain plant.

Over the years, other ingredients were added such as pumpkin (''{{lang|ain|kabocha}}''), and potato (''{{lang|ain|imo}}''). Similar to the Japanese ''[[kusamochi]]'', the Ainu also made ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' which mixed in Japanese mugwort (''{{lang|ain|noya}}'').

The Ainu first came in contact with Japanese style mochi after the [[Edo period]] when more ethnic Japanese moved to live in the same areas as the Ainu under the land contract system.<ref name=\"ainuonoukou1969\"/>{{rp|171}}\n\n== Preserved Foods ==\n\n=== Dried meat and fish ===\n[[File:Saketoba.JPG|alt=Strips of dried salmon meat.|thumb|Saketoba, a famous local delicacy from Hokkaid\u014d, said to have developed from Ainu preserved foods.]]\nThe Ainu word for dried meat is ''{{lang|ain|satkam}}'' while dried fish is called ''{{lang|ain|satcep}}'', ''{{lang|ain|nikeruy}}'', or ''{{lang|ain|atat}}''.\n\nSalmon was fished in quantities greater than what could be eaten immediately, especially in fall, and processed into preserved food so it could last up to six months. The first step in the process was to remove the head and internal organs of the fish, which was then dried on a rack outside before being taken inside and smoked in the hearth. Trout (''{{lang|ain|icaniw}}'') and Japanese char (''{{lang|ain|tuksis}}'') caught in summer were dried over a fire to prevent flies damaging the fish. These dried fish were eaten as is by pulling off the meat, or by rehydrating in water and eating as ingredients in soup or as a final cooked item itself. Salmon that was dried after the fish had laid eggs lost much of its flavor, so it was often stewed with added fish fats to improve the taste.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|79-85}}\n\nMilt (''{{lang|ain|up}}'') and salmon roe (''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'') obtained when slicing open the fish were also dried and preserved then later used in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' or to make stock for ''{{lang|ain|ohaw}}''.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|157-158}}\n\nWhile it was common to eat everything of a bear raw while it was still fresh, including its meat and its internal organs, the Ainu would also preserve some of the meat for consumption during the off season. Meat from deer (''{{lang|ain|yuk}}'') and brown bears (''{{lang|ain|kimun kamuy}}'') was cut into narrow strips and simmered in a large pot. Once the juices were removed, the meat was hung over the fire inside to dry and smoke. This ''{{lang|ain|satkam}}'' would be eaten as is, or boiled again to create a soup.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|95}}\n\n=== ''Cardiocrinum cordatum'' starch ===\nThe starch obtained from ''Cardiocrinum cordatum'' bulbs (''{{lang|ain|turep}}'') held a more important position in the Ainu diet than grains.\n[[File:Cardiocrinum cordatum (bud).jpg|link=link=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ja/thumb/a/a3/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%82%A6%E3%83%90%E3%83%A6%E3%83%AA%E8%91%89.JPG/1200px-%E3%82%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%82%A6%E3%83%90%E3%83%A6%E3%83%AA%E8%91%89.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|''[[Cardiocrinum cordatum]]'' plant.]]\nThe Ainu word for the fourth month of the lunar calendar is ''{{lang|ain|mo kiwtacup}}'', which translates to \u201csoon to be time to dig up ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' month\u201d, while the fifth month is ''{{lang|ain|si kiwtacup}}'', or \u201cdigging up ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' month\u201d.<ref name=\"ainurekishi1968\" />{{rp|129}}  This was the time when Ainu women would take their sacks (''{{lang|ain|saranip}}'') and digging sticks (''{{lang|ain|itani}}'') and head into the mountains to gather the bulbs. The gathered bulbs were processed into starch using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|196-201}}\n\n# Remove leaves and roots from the bulb, peel the scales off one by one, and rinse in water.\n# Place the scales in a large bucket. Grind until a sticky paste is formed using the head of a hatchet as a pestle. Pour large quantities of water into the bucket and let sit for about two days.\n# Fine fibers and skins will float to the surface of the water forming a scum after a few days have passed and the starch will settle to the bottom. The fibrous scum is removed and set aside for use in on turep. The starch collected on the bottom of the bucket is divided into two types of starch: the semi-liquid secondary starch and the powdered primary starch.\n\nThese two types of starch were dried and preserved, but before that, they were also used to make fresh foods. The primary starch was mixed with water and poured into the hollow of plant stems from the Japanese knotweed (''{{lang|ain|kuttar}}'') or ''[[Parasenecio hastatus]]'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and placed into the ashes of a fire to cook into a thin noodle-like shape. The secondary starch was formed into round dumplings, wrapped in the leaves of the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or magnolia (''{{lang|ain|pusni}}''), then placed in the ashes of a fire to bake. They were then eaten with salmon roe or animal fats.\n\nThe secondary starch was the one which was used on a daily basis once it had been dried for preservation. It was often formed into dumplings and added to ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''. The primary starch was rarely eaten, instead being reserved for gifts or used as medicine.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|188}}\n\nIt was considered taboo to speak of alcohol or love affairs while working on any part of the starch making process. It was said such discussions would agitate the starch and it would fail to settle properly.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|200}}\n\n===''{{lang|ain|On turep}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|On turep}}'' translates as \u201cfermented ''{{lang|ain|turep}}''\u201d. It is a preserved food fermented from the fiber and skin byproduct of the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' starch extraction process. It was made using the following method.<ref name=\"ainunoshokuji1992\" />{{rp|201}}\n\n# An ''{{lang|ain|icari}}'' (sieve) is used to gather the fiber and skins that float in or on the water after the ''{{lang|ain|turep}}'' bulbs have been crushed and soaked in water.\n# The water is thoroughly wrung from the fiber, then it is wrapped in leaves from the Japanese butterbur (''{{lang|ain|korkoni}}'') or ''Parasenecio hastatus'' (''{{lang|ain|wakkakutu}}'') and left to ferment for three to ten days. This fermenting process is called \u201c''{{lang|ain|on}}''\u201d.\n# The fermented product is ground thoroughly with a mortar and pestle. Once pounded, it is kneaded, formed into donut-like shapes, and dried.\n# A cord is passed through the center and the ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' is stored hung from a rack above the hearth.\n\nThe ''{{lang|ain|on turep}}'' was eaten by smashing and rehydrating it to form into dumplings and placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}''.\n\n===''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}''===\n''{{lang|ain|Pocche-imo}}'' is a preserved potato food also known as ''{{lang|ain|penekoshoi-imo}}'' or ''{{lang|ain|munini-imo}}''. The process involved uses the extreme cold of Hokkaid\u014d in a fashion similar to the production of [[chu\u00f1o]] in South America.\n\nOnce potatoes were harvested in the fall, the poorly shaped and small potatoes were left outside. The winter\u2019s cold would soon come and freeze the potatoes, which would thaw again in spring. This process of freezing and thawing would break down the structure of the potatoes, turning them soft. Once in that state, the potatoes were soaked in water and thawed completely. The starch that settled to the bottom of the water was collected, formed into spheres, and arranged in a warm place to ferment. This resulted in a fine textured potato flour. The flour was formed into cakes and baked in the ashes of the fire, then bear fat or ''{{lang|ain|cipor}}'' (salmon roe) was added and together placed in ''{{lang|ain|sayo}}'' to eat.<ref name=\"ainusaijiki2000\">{{cite book |last1=Kayano |first1=Shigeru |title=Ainu saijiki : Nibutani no kurashi to kokoro |date=2000 |publisher=Heibonsha |isbn=4582850545 |page=50 |edition=Shohan}}</ref> In modern times with the influence of ethnic Japanese culture, it became more common to flavor ''{{lang|ain|pocche-imo}}'' with artificial flavorings such as [[saccharin]] then deep fry them.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "name_user": "Erynamrod", "label": "safe", "comment": "Romanized references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_cuisine"}
