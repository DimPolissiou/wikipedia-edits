Some album covers (including those of ''[[Les merveilles du pass\u00e9]]'' and ''[[Zekete Zekete]]'') report the first word as Zaiko, while others use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (i.e., \"Za\u00efko\"). The official [[web site]] of the band has both variants. \"Langa Langa\" is sometimes written \"Langa-Langa\" (for example on the cover of ''[[Le beau temps]]'', ''[[Zaire-Ghana]]'', ''[[Pacha Labaran]]'' and the ''[[Le meilleurs souvenirs vol. 1|Le meilleurs souvenirs]]'' series). As was common with soukous recordings, many album covers report modified versions of the band name with leading [[epithet]]s such as \"Tout-Choc\" or \"Anti-Choc\" (or both: \"Tout-Choc Anti-Choc Zaiko Langa Langa\").</ref> is a popular [[Contemporary]] band from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]. Their music and creativity has greatly influenced Congolese and African popular culture like no other band has done.

The word \"Zaiko\" is a [[portmanteau]] for the [[lingala language|lingala]] phrase ''Zaire ya bankoko'', meaning \"Zaire of our ancestors\", where \"Zaire\" must be read as a reference to the river by that name, now called [[Congo River|Congo]]. The meaning of the phrase \"Langa Langa\" is controversial; according to the band's [[website]], it means \"marvelous\" or \"almighty\".<ref>Stewart, in ''Rumba on the River'' (p. 158), claims that \"Langa Langa\" means \"to get drunk\" in lingala (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKEHO1z413EC&pg=PA158&lpg=PA159&dq=%22Zaiko+Langa+Langa%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html]).

This large group of related bands is sometimes referred to as \"Clan Langa Langa\" (i.e., \"the Langa Langa family\").\n\nIn 2000, Zaiko Langa Langa were awarded by the [[Congolese Media Association]] as the best Congolese musical group of the 20th century.<ref>See the \"Palma Res\" section of  [http://www.zaikolangalanga.com Zaiko Langa Langa's official site].</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1969-1974 Early years and the invention of Cavacha===\nThe band was formed on December 24, 1969<ref name=\"Eshar\">https://web.archive.org/web/20090101165302/https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/24067</ref> with the provisional name \"Orchestra Zaiko\". The original lineup was composed of [[Papa Wemba]], [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Evoloko Lay Lay]], [[Teddy Sukami]], [[Oncle Bapius]], [[Zamuangana le meneur]] and [[Manuaku Waku]] (also known as P\u00e9p\u00e9 Fely) and [[N'Yoka Longo]].<ref name=\"Longo\">See ''N'Yoka Longo: The Charismatic Leader of Zaiko Langa Langa''</ref> The band also had a pop section, which was playing before the [[soukous]] section, with [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Mbuta Matima]] and [[Mashakado Mbuta]]. Moanda, Mongombe, Marcelin, Waku, Longo and Bita were all from a former band called [[Bel Guide National]].<ref>See ''Origines of Zaiko'', on the band's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621234632/http://zaikolangalanga.com/EngZaikoOrigine.htm official site]</ref> They were mostly students of Angolans refugees descent coming from upper-class families of [[Kinshasa]].\n\nThe sound of Zaiko Langa Langa was revolutionary with respect to the soukous tradition. They adopted a more up-tempo beat, abandoned wind instruments and emphasized [[snare drum]]s and lead [[electric guitar]]s (and eventually also [[synthesizer]]s). The percussion rhythms were adapted from traditional Congolese music and the [[sebene]] became more prominent.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4azzvK4AudYC&pg=PA70&dq=%22Zaiko+Langa+Langa%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Nuttall, ''Beautiful Ugly'', p.70]</ref> Their vocal lines made a large use of the [[call and response]] schemes. Their frenetic stage shows featured a frontline of four singers.\n\nBecause of these innovations, they are sometimes referred to as the founders of the \"third school\" of Congolese soukous.<ref name=\"Longo\"/> The \"first school\" is probably that of soukous bands of the 1940s, such as [[Wendo Kolosoy]] ans [[Adou Elenga]] while the \"second school\" could be that of [[Le Grand Kall\u00e9 et l'African Jazz]] and [[Franco Luambo]]'s [[OK Jazz]]. While their \"rebel\" attitude, which resembled that of the [[hippie]] movement, earned them the sobriquet of \"Zaire's [[Rolling Stones]]\".<ref name=\"Biography of Zaiko Langa Langa\"/>\n\nZaiko quickly became one of the most popular groups of Zaire and had a large fan base among Kinshasa's juveniles. In the 1970s, Zaiko's singers [[Evoloko Jocker|Evoloko \"Lay Lay\" Joker]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Gina Efonge]], [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Nyoka Longo]] and [[Bimi Ombale]] popularized a rhythm known as ''[[cavacha]]'' which was dominated by faster drum and melodic faster lead guitar also called [[sebene]]. Also spelled \"[[kavasha]], that was a decade-lasting craze in most of [[East Africa]].\nInspired by the [[Woodstock]] movement, Zaiko will introduced the rhythm [[Wondostoke]] in mid seventies, which was an even faster drums and lead guitar and pop dancing inspired by [[James Brown]].\nIn 1974, Zaiko Langa Langa were amongst the Zairean bands to be invited to play in [[Zaire '74]], a huge musical event celebrating the [[The Rumble in the Jungle|Rumble in the Jungle]].<ref name=\"Longo\"/>\n\n===1975-80 Departures and new members===\nIn 1975 because of a conflict of leadership between [[Anto Evoloko]] and [[Pepe Manuaku]] the band lost some of its most important members in [[Papa Wemba]], [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Mavuela Somo]] and [[Evoloko]] who left to form [[Isifi Lokole]] (with the former three moving on to form [[Yoka Lokale]] in 1976).\nThis first version of [[Zaiko Langa Langa]] will deeply mark Zairian music with hits like [[Mosinzo]] first recorded Zaiko song, [[Francine Keller]], [[La tout beige]], [[Chouchouna]], [[Marceline]], [[Liziba]], [[Joliba]], [[Mbeya Mbeya]], [[Onasis]], [[Eluzam]], [[Vie ya Misolo]], [[Bandoki]], [[Mwana Wabi]], [[Mizou]], [[Zena]], [[BP ya munu]], [[Yo nalinga]] and many more\nAfter a brief period of inactivity, Zaiko Langa Langa returned in action with a new line up of singers consisting of [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Redo Likinga]] and [[Mbua Mashakado]] and released popular songs such as [[Beli Mashakado]], [[Lisapo]], [[Ma coco]], [[Toli Kulumpe]], [[Toli ya Liyanza]], [[Eboza]], [[Yudasi]] and 1975 song of the year [[Elo (song)|Elo]]. In these years Zaiko maintained a prominent position in the soukous scenes, while competing with its own spin-offs such as [[Isifi Melodia]] of [[Anto Evoloko]], [[Yoka Lokole]] of [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Libanko]] of [[Gina Efonge]] whose return into Zaiko will be short and later on in 1977 [[Viva La Musica]] of [[Papa Wemba]]. \n\nThe outcome of the personnel changes in the band was the establishment of [[Pepe Manuaku]] as the new leader and the band production of the latter 1970s are particularly sophisticated both in terms of [[melody]] and [[orchestration]], and the [[choreography]] of the live performance was also richer than it was in the early years. In 1975 too saw the establishment of the longest serving front singers of Zaiko in [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]] and [[Likinga Redo]] who will become for fourteen years the face of Zaiko and impose Zaiko as the ultimate heavy weight of youth music in [[Zaire]]. The success of the band was so huge and unprecedented in Zairian music history  especially in releasing outstanding songs like [[Nalali pongi]], [[Zaiko wa wa]], [[Kin Kiesse]], [[Ma (song)|Ma]], [[IMA (song)|IMA]], [[fololo ya nzembo]], [[omibongisa]], [[Cit\u00e9 d'ambiance]], [[Pacha labaran]], [[Sangela]], [[Nadi]], [[Likamuisi]], [[Diana ya mama]], [[Didina]], [[Vera (Congolese song)|Vera]], [[Esikebene]], [[Souvenir Djeni]], [[Mangobo]], [[Misolina]] and many more that all the personnel that have left the band were queuing to return. In 1977, [[Bozi Boziana]] rejoined the group, followed by [[Mashakado Mbuta]] and [[Evoloko]] in 1979.\n\nIn 1979 with a line up of 10 singers namely [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Redo Likings]], [[Mbuta Mashakado]], [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Anto Evoloko]], [[Yenga Yenga]], [[Sheikedan]] and [[Otis Mbuta]]  [[Zaiko]] will be revisited by the demons of division. The band will be divided in two groups hostile to each other and pursuing different music philosophy. [[Anto Evoloko]] will lead his group of [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Lengi Lenga]] and the newcomer [[Yenga Yenga]]. [[Nyoka Longo]] too will lead his group of [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Likinga]], [[Shekedan]]. The two group will release songs that were artistically different of each other, the [[Anto Evoloko]] group will release [[7 sacrament]], [[Kemoussa]], [[Belinda]], [[esengo na bango]], [[Betula]] and others while [[Nyoka Kongo]] group will release [[Pa oki]], [[Cherie nzembo]], [[Moni Amina]], [[Cherie B Wabi]] and many more including best song of the year 1979 [[Sentiment Away]]. The band leader and guitarist [[Pepe Manuaku]] who was more focus into his innovative sounds and collaboration in the [[Ya Toupa]] group where he was experimenting sounds with the pianist [[Ray Lema]] with songs like [[Ange Bokumba]], Revelation, [[Zaiko Wa wa]] however he will try to unite the two groups with songs like [[Obi (song)|Obi]], [[Kwiti Kwiti]] and [[Femme ne pleure pas]] but will fail as many band members considered him partisan and favouring the [[Anto Evoloko]] group. On the other hand, [[Teddy Sukami]] another veteran of the band will focus his attention more in releasing songs with the recording studio group [[Les Casques Bleus]] than with [[Zaiko]] even scoring 1978 song of the year [[Bongo boug\u00e9]] with Les Casques bleus. The conflict will result in 1980 departure of band leader, co-founder and lead-guitarist [[Pepe Manuaku]], taking with him [[Shekedan]] and [[Yenga Yenga]] to start his own band [[Grand Zaiko Wa Wa]].\n\n===1980-88 Departure of Pepe Manuaku and addition of Atalaku===\nFollowing the departure of [[Pepe Manuaku]], [[Roxy Tshimpaka]] (also called [[Grand Niawu]]) became as lead guitarist and [[Mbuta Matima]] became artistic director. During this period Zaiko Langa Langa released many of their most famous songs including [[Crois moi]], [[Amiti\u00e9]], [[Viya (song)|Viya]], [[Essesse]], [[LA Blonde]], [[Kamanzi]], [[Cherie Massa]], [[Lolita]], [[Kinshasa makambo]] and 1981 song of the year [[Fievre mondo]].\n\nHowever there were further internal quarrels and personnel changes with the departure in 1981 of Evoloko, Bozi Boziana and Djo Mali to form [[Langa Langa Stars]], joined a year later by Roxy Tshimpaka. By 1982 N'yoka Longo had become the effective band leader however there were also some unofficial recordings without his involvement or sanction<ref>https://www.totallyradio.com/shows/african-and-global-beat/episodes/78506</ref>.\n\nIn 1982 Zaiko introduced maracas and [[Atalaku]] ('animateur' in French or a specialist vocal typically over the 'sebene') in the band. The Atalaku firstly performed solo by [[Sonnerie]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2019}} in the critically acclaimed album [[tokangi robinet]] brought in the traditional elements into Zaiko and Congolese pop music. The mixture of maracas, African drum play by [[Djerba]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2019}} and Atalaku (traditional animation) now led by Bebe and Nono will bring huge success to the band as well as revolutionized Congolese popular music.\n\nIn 1984, [[Dindo Yogo]] arrived as a singer in the band and quickly became the group's dominant solo vocalist.\n\nDuring this period Zaiko released successful albums regularly. The band was touring Europe and Africa and was the first Zairian band to visit [[Japan]].\n\n===1988-1998 Split to Nkolo Mboka and Familia Dei===\n\nIn 1988 the band experienced another major split, between the two leaders of the group Nyoka Longo and Bimi Ombale. The band was divided in two with every musician choosing his camp between the two leaders who were part of Zaiko since its creation. With [[Meridjo]], [[Bapius]], [[Matima]], [[Zamuangana]] who were part of Zaiko from its creation staying with Nyoka Longo followed by [[Dindo Yogo]] and the band was called then [[Zaiko Langa Langa Nkolo Mboka]], to differentiate it from the band of Bimi Ombale which was called [[Zaiko Langa Langa Familia Dei]] and had [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Ilo Pablo]], [[JP Buse]] and the rest of the musicians that came in the 1980s. Zaiko Langa Langa Familia Dei dissolved in 1986<ref>http://rumbaontheriver.com/zaiko.html</ref>, after which time N'Yoka Longo's group reacquired the original name \"Zaiko Langa Langa\", which has maintained until today. N'Yoka Longo is{{when|date=March 2019}} still the leader of the group.\n\n===1999-present===\n\nIn 1999 a further split came with the dismissal of two other senior members of the band in drummer Meridjo and bassist Bapius, who went on to form the short-lived Zaiko Langa Langa Universel<ref>http://rumbaontheriver.com/zaiko.html</ref>.\n\nIn 2002, Zaiko performed in the mythic arena [[Zenith of Paris]], France. More than 6.000 fans attended. This was considered by many as the renaissance or rebirth of Zaiko. As early as 1988, Zaiko, being very popular at that time, made plan to perform in Zenith but the great split that occurred in the band stopped it for doing so.\n\nZaiko spent 6 and half years in Europe (2002\u201309). Its headquarters ware in Bruxelles, Belgium. But the band gave more concerts in France and other countries around Europe.\nDuring that time in Europe, Zaiko released three albums: Eureka (2002), Empreintes (2004), Recontres (2006). In the last album, Nyoka Longo invited many former Zaiko musicians like Malage, Beniko Popolipo; and a retired Congolese musician [[Tony Dee Bokito]]. He also recruited from Kinshasa, the son of late Dindo Yogo, [[Lola Muana]].\n\nDuring the time the Band was in Europe, Nyoka Longo, in 2006, charged Lola Muana, who was then in Kinshasa, to form a group that would promote Zaiko music in [[D.R.Congo]]. Lola recruited and formed a subsidiary group of Zaiko called [[Les Ganers de Zaiko]]. [[Bapius Muaka]], a longtime guitarist bass player who left the group during a minor split of 1999, joined the Ganers too.\n\nThe group returned in D.R.Congo in January 2009 with only five musicians: Nyoka Longo, [[Doudou Adoula]], [[Chou Lay Evoloko]], [[Malage de Lugendo]], [[Gege Mangaya]], [[Shango Landu]] and Lola Muana. Other members of the group defected and stayed in Europe where they formed a new band named [[Les Stars de Zaiko]] under the leadership of Adamo Ekula. Couple years later, they renamed their new band [[Zaikas Kolo Mboka]].\n\nSince his recruitment in Zaiko, Lola Muana was regarded by many as the principal heir of Zaiko. But in 2009, he was forced to quit the group because of his proposal to have a valid work contract with the group. His request was denied by the President of Zaiko, N'Yoka Longo Mvula Jossart. The son of Evoloko, Shou Lay, who backed Lola's request left the group too. In November 2011, Lola Muana was reinstated in the group.\n\n==Clan Langa Langa==\nZaiko Langa Langa were both influential in their own right and through their many spin-offs. Most of these maintained a strong link to the original formation, and this is often reflected by the names they adopted. The groups that somehow belong to the Zaiko Langa Langa \"[[Franchising|franchise]]\" are collectively known as the \"Clan Langa Langa\".

The official [[web site]] of the band has both variants. \"Langa Langa\" is sometimes written \"Langa-Langa\" (for example on the cover of ''[[Le beau temps]]'', ''[[Zaire-Ghana]]'', ''[[Pacha Labaran]]'' and the ''[[Le meilleurs souvenirs vol. 1|Le meilleurs souvenirs]]'' series). As was common with soukous recordings, many album covers report modified versions of the band name with leading [[epithet]]s such as \"Tout-Choc\" or \"Anti-Choc\" (or both: \"Tout-Choc Anti-Choc Zaiko Langa Langa\").</ref> is a popular [[Contemporary]] band from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]. Their music and creativity has greatly influenced Congolese and African popular culture like no other band has done. Voted and crowned band of the century in DR Congo \" Zaiko remain the most influential band ever in the history of African music. The word \"Zaiko\" is a [[portmanteau]] for the [[lingala language|lingala]] phrase ''Zaire ya bankoko'', meaning \"Zaire of our ancestors\", where \"Zaire\" must be read as a reference to the river by that name, now called [[Congo River|Congo]]. The meaning of the phrase \"Langa Langa\" is controversial; according to the band's [[website]], it means \"marvelous\" or \"almighty\".<ref>Stewart, in ''Rumba on the River'' (p. 158), claims that \"Langa Langa\" means \"to get drunk\" in lingala (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKEHO1z413EC&pg=PA158&lpg=PA159&dq=%22Zaiko+Langa+Langa%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html]).

Moanda]], [[Marcelin Delo]], [[Henry Mongombe]], Olemi Eshar-Eshar dem'belina and [[Andre Bita]], Zaiko Langa Langa survived into the 2000s (decade), and have been largely popular through the decades.

This large group of related bands is sometimes referred to as \"Clan Langa Langa\" (i.e., \"the Langa Langa family\").\n\nIn 2000, Zaiko Langa Langa were awarded by the [[Congolese Media Association]] as the best Congolese musical group of the 20th century.<ref>See the \"Palma Res\" section of  [http://www.zaikolangalanga.com Zaiko Langa Langa's official site].</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1969-1974 Early years and the invention of Cavacha===\nThe band was formed on December 24, 1969<ref name=\"Eshar\">https://web.archive.org/web/20090101165302/https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/24067</ref> with the provisional name \"Orchestra Zaiko\". The original lineup was composed of [[Papa Wemba]], [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Evoloko Lay Lay]], [[Teddy Sukami]], [[Oncle Bapius]], [[Zamuangana le meneur]] and [[Manuaku Waku]] (also known as P\u00e9p\u00e9 Fely) and [[N'Yoka Longo]].<ref name=\"Longo\">See ''N'Yoka Longo: The Charismatic Leader of Zaiko Langa Langa''</ref> The band also had a pop section, which was playing before the [[soukous]] section, with [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Mbuta Matima]] and [[Mashakado Mbuta]]. Moanda, Mongombe, Marcelin, Waku, Longo and Bita were all from a former band called [[Bel Guide National]].<ref>See ''Origines of Zaiko'', on the band's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621234632/http://zaikolangalanga.com/EngZaikoOrigine.htm official site]</ref> They were mostly students of Angolans refugees descent coming from upper-class families of [[Kinshasa]].\n\nThe sound of Zaiko Langa Langa was revolutionary with respect to the soukous tradition. They adopted a more up-tempo beat, abandoned wind instruments and emphasized [[snare drum]]s and lead [[electric guitar]]s (and eventually also [[synthesizer]]s). The percussion rhythms were adapted from traditional Congolese music and the [[sebene]] became more prominent.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4azzvK4AudYC&pg=PA70&dq=%22Zaiko+Langa+Langa%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Nuttall, ''Beautiful Ugly'', p.70]</ref> Their vocal lines made a large use of the [[call and response]] schemes. Their frenetic stage shows featured a frontline of four singers.\n\nBecause of these innovations, they are sometimes referred to as the founders of the \"third school\" of Congolese soukous.<ref name=\"Longo\"/> The \"first school\" is probably that of soukous bands of the 1940s, such as [[Wendo Kolosoy]] ans [[Adou Elenga]] while the \"second school\" could be that of [[Le Grand Kall\u00e9 et l'African Jazz]] and [[Franco Luambo]]'s [[OK Jazz]]. While their \"rebel\" attitude, which resembled that of the [[hippie]] movement, earned them the sobriquet of \"Zaire's [[Rolling Stones]]\".<ref name=\"Biography of Zaiko Langa Langa\"/>\n\nZaiko quickly became one of the most popular groups of Zaire and had a large fan base among Kinshasa's juveniles. In the 1970s, Zaiko's singers [[Evoloko Jocker|Evoloko \"Lay Lay\" Joker]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Gina Efonge]], [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Nyoka Longo]] and [[Bimi Ombale]] popularized a rhythm known as ''[[cavacha]]'' which was dominated by faster drum and melodic faster lead guitar also called [[sebene]]. Also spelled \"[[kavasha]], that was a decade-lasting craze in most of [[East Africa]].\nInspired by the [[Woodstock]] movement, Zaiko will introduced the rhythm [[Wondostoke]] in mid seventies, which was an even faster drums and lead guitar and pop dancing inspired by [[James Brown]].\nIn 1974, Zaiko Langa Langa were amongst the Zairean bands to be invited to play in [[Zaire '74]], a huge musical event celebrating the [[The Rumble in the Jungle|Rumble in the Jungle]].<ref name=\"Longo\"/>\n\n===1975-80 Departures and new members===\nIn 1975 because of a conflict of leadership between [[Anto Evoloko]] and [[Pepe Manuaku]] the band lost some of its most important members in [[Papa Wemba]], [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Mavuela Somo]] and [[Evoloko]] who left to form [[Isifi Lokole]] (with the former three moving on to form [[Yoka Lokale]] in 1976).\nThis first version of [[Zaiko Langa Langa]] will deeply mark Zairian music with hits like [[Mosinzo]] first recorded Zaiko song, [[Francine Keller]], [[La tout beige]], [[Chouchouna]], [[Marceline]], [[Liziba]], [[Joliba]], [[Mbeya Mbeya]], [[Onasis]], [[Eluzam]], [[Vie ya Misolo]], [[Bandoki]], [[Mwana Wabi]], [[Mizou]], [[Zena]], [[BP ya munu]], [[Yo nalinga]] and many more\nAfter a brief period of inactivity, Zaiko Langa Langa returned in action with a new line up of singers consisting of [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Redo Likinga]] and [[Mbua Mashakado]] and released popular songs such as [[Beli Mashakado]], [[Lisapo]], [[Ma coco]], [[Toli Kulumpe]], [[Toli ya Liyanza]], [[Eboza]], [[Yudasi]] and 1975 song of the year [[Elo (song)|Elo]]. In these years Zaiko maintained a prominent position in the soukous scenes, while competing with its own spin-offs such as [[Isifi Melodia]] of [[Anto Evoloko]], [[Yoka Lokole]] of [[Mavuela Somo]], [[Libanko]] of [[Gina Efonge]] whose return into Zaiko will be short and later on in 1977 [[Viva La Musica]] of [[Papa Wemba]]. \n\nThe outcome of the personnel changes in the band was the establishment of [[Pepe Manuaku]] as the new leader and the band production of the latter 1970s are particularly sophisticated both in terms of [[melody]] and [[orchestration]], and the [[choreography]] of the live performance was also richer than it was in the early years. In 1975 too saw the establishment of the longest serving front singers of Zaiko in [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]] and [[Likinga Redo]] who will become for fourteen years the face of Zaiko and impose Zaiko as the ultimate heavy weight of youth music in [[Zaire]]. The success of the band was so huge and unprecedented in Zairian music history  especially in releasing outstanding songs like [[Nalali pongi]], [[Zaiko wa wa]], [[Kin Kiesse]], [[Ma (song)|Ma]], [[IMA (song)|IMA]], [[fololo ya nzembo]], [[omibongisa]], [[Cit\u00e9 d'ambiance]], [[Pacha labaran]], [[Sangela]], [[Nadi]], [[Likamuisi]], [[Diana ya mama]], [[Didina]], [[Vera (Congolese song)|Vera]], [[Esikebene]], [[Souvenir Djeni]], [[Mangobo]], [[Misolina]] and many more that all the personnel that have left the band were queuing to return. In 1977, [[Bozi Boziana]] rejoined the group, followed by [[Mashakado Mbuta]] and [[Evoloko]] in 1979.\n\nIn 1979 with a line up of 10 singers namely [[Nyoka Longo]], [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Redo Likings]], [[Mbuta Mashakado]], [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Anto Evoloko]], [[Yenga Yenga]], [[Sheikedan]] and [[Otis Mbuta]]  [[Zaiko]] will be revisited by the demons of division. The band will be divided in two groups hostile to each other and pursuing different music philosophy. [[Anto Evoloko]] will lead his group of [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Lengi Lenga]] and the newcomer [[Yenga Yenga]]. [[Nyoka Longo]] too will lead his group of [[Bimi Ombale]], [[Likinga]], [[Shekedan]]. The two group will release songs that were artistically different of each other, the [[Anto Evoloko]] group will release [[7 sacrament]], [[Kemoussa]], [[Belinda]], [[esengo na bango]], [[Betula]] and others while [[Nyoka Kongo]] group will release [[Pa oki]], [[Cherie nzembo]], [[Moni Amina]], [[Cherie B Wabi]] and many more including best song of the year 1979 [[Sentiment Away]]. The band leader and guitarist [[Pepe Manuaku]] who was more focus into his innovative sounds and collaboration in the [[Ya Toupa]] group where he was experimenting sounds with the pianist [[Ray Lema]] with songs like [[Ange Bokumba]], Revelation, [[Zaiko Wa wa]] however he will try to unite the two groups with songs like [[Obi (song)|Obi]], [[Kwiti Kwiti]] and [[Femme ne pleure pas]] but will fail as many band members considered him partisan and favouring the [[Anto Evoloko]] group. On the other hand, [[Teddy Sukami]] another veteran of the band will focus his attention more in releasing songs with the recording studio group [[Les Casques Bleus]] than with [[Zaiko]] even scoring 1978 song of the year [[Bongo boug\u00e9]] with Les Casques bleus. The conflict will result in 1980 departure of band leader, co-founder and lead-guitarist [[Pepe Manuaku]], taking with him [[Shekedan]] and [[Yenga Yenga]] to start his own band [[Grand Zaiko Wa Wa]].\n\n===1980-88 Departure of Pepe Manuaku and addition of Atalaku===\nFollowing the departure of [[Pepe Manuaku]], [[Roxy Tshimpaka]] (also called [[Grand Niawu]]) became as lead guitarist and [[Mbuta Matima]] became artistic director. During this period Zaiko Langa Langa released many of their most famous songs including [[Crois moi]], [[Amiti\u00e9]], [[Viya (song)|Viya]], [[Essesse]], [[LA Blonde]], [[Kamanzi]], [[Cherie Massa]], [[Lolita]], [[Kinshasa makambo]] and 1981 song of the year [[Fievre mondo]].\n\nHowever there were further internal quarrels and personnel changes with the departure in 1981 of Evoloko, Bozi Boziana and Djo Mali to form [[Langa Langa Stars]], joined a year later by Roxy Tshimpaka. By 1982 N'yoka Longo had become the effective band leader however there were also some unofficial recordings without his involvement or sanction<ref>https://www.totallyradio.com/shows/african-and-global-beat/episodes/78506</ref>.\n\nIn 1982 Zaiko introduced maracas and [[Atalaku]] ('animateur' in French or a specialist vocal typically over the 'sebene') in the band. The Atalaku firstly performed solo by [[Sonnerie]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2019}} in the critically acclaimed album [[tokangi robinet]] brought in the traditional elements into Zaiko and Congolese pop music. The mixture of maracas, African drum play by [[Djerba]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2019}} and Atalaku (traditional animation) now led by Bebe and Nono will bring huge success to the band as well as revolutionized Congolese popular music.\n\nIn 1984, [[Dindo Yogo]] arrived as a singer in the band and quickly became the group's dominant solo vocalist.\n\nDuring this period Zaiko released successful albums regularly. The band was touring Europe and Africa and was the first Zairian band to visit [[Japan]].\n\n===1988-1998 Split to Nkolo Mboka and Familia Dei===\n\nIn 1988 the band experienced another major split, between the two leaders of the group Nyoka Longo and Bimi Ombale. The band was divided in two with every musician choosing his camp between the two leaders who were part of Zaiko since its creation. With [[Meridjo]], [[Bapius]], [[Matima]], [[Zamuangana]] who were part of Zaiko from its creation staying with Nyoka Longo followed by [[Dindo Yogo]] and the band was called then [[Zaiko Langa Langa Nkolo Mboka]], to differentiate it from the band of Bimi Ombale which was called [[Zaiko Langa Langa Familia Dei]] and had [[Lengi Lenga]], [[Ilo Pablo]], [[JP Buse]] and the rest of the musicians that came in the 1980s. Zaiko Langa Langa Familia Dei dissolved in 1986<ref>http://rumbaontheriver.com/zaiko.html</ref>, after which time N'Yoka Longo's group reacquired the original name \"Zaiko Langa Langa\", which has maintained until today. N'Yoka Longo is{{when|date=March 2019}} still the leader of the group.\n\n===1999-present===\n\nIn 1999 a further split came with the dismissal of two other senior members of the band in drummer Meridjo and bassist Bapius, who went on to form the short-lived Zaiko Langa Langa Universel<ref>http://rumbaontheriver.com/zaiko.html</ref>.\n\nIn 2002, Zaiko performed in the mythic arena [[Zenith of Paris]], France. More than 6.000 fans attended. This was considered by many as the renaissance or rebirth of Zaiko. As early as 1988, Zaiko, being very popular at that time, made plan to perform in Zenith but the great split that occurred in the band stopped it for doing so.\n\nZaiko spent 6 and half years in Europe (2002\u201309). Its headquarters ware in Bruxelles, Belgium. But the band gave more concerts in France and other countries around Europe.\nDuring that time in Europe, Zaiko released three albums: Eureka (2002), Empreintes (2004), Recontres (2006). In the last album, Nyoka Longo invited many former Zaiko musicians like Malage, Beniko Popolipo; and a retired Congolese musician [[Tony Dee Bokito]]. He also recruited from Kinshasa, the son of late Dindo Yogo, [[Lola Muana]].\n\nDuring the time the Band was in Europe, Nyoka Longo, in 2006, charged Lola Muana, who was then in Kinshasa, to form a group that would promote Zaiko music in [[D.R.Congo]]. Lola recruited and formed a subsidiary group of Zaiko called [[Les Ganers de Zaiko]]. [[Bapius Muaka]], a longtime guitarist bass player who left the group during a minor split of 1999, joined the Ganers too.\n\nThe group returned in D.R.Congo in January 2009 with only five musicians: Nyoka Longo, [[Doudou Adoula]], [[Chou Lay Evoloko]], [[Malage de Lugendo]], [[Gege Mangaya]], [[Shango Landu]] and Lola Muana. Other members of the group defected and stayed in Europe where they formed a new band named [[Les Stars de Zaiko]] under the leadership of Adamo Ekula. Couple years later, they renamed their new band [[Zaikas Kolo Mboka]].\n\nSince his recruitment in Zaiko, Lola Muana was regarded by many as the principal heir of Zaiko. But in 2009, he was forced to quit the group because of his proposal to have a valid work contract with the group. His request was denied by the President of Zaiko, N'Yoka Longo Mvula Jossart. The son of Evoloko, Shou Lay, who backed Lola's request left the group too. In November 2011, Lola Muana was reinstated in the group.\n\n==Clan Langa Langa==\nZaiko Langa Langa were both influential in their own right and through their many spin-offs. Most of these maintained a strong link to the original formation, and this is often reflected by the names they adopted. The groups that somehow belong to the Zaiko Langa Langa \"[[Franchising|franchise]]\" are collectively known as the \"Clan Langa Langa\". This includes:\n\n* [[Isifi Lokole]] (1974-1978)- [[Papa Wemba]], [[Bozi Boziana]], [[Evoloko Jocker]], [[Mavuela Somo]]\n* [[Yoka Lokole]] (1978-Pr\u00e9sent) - Papa Wemba, Bozi Boziana, Mavuela Somo\n* [[Grand Za\u00efko Wa Wa]] (1981-Pr\u00e9sent) - [[Manuaku Waku]] who was joined by successful singers like [[Shimita]], [[Djo Poster]] among others\n* [[Viva La Musica]] (1977\u20132016) - Papa Wemba, joined by [[Emeneya Mubiala]], [[Dindo Yogo]]\n* [[Tout Grand Libanko]] (1977-Pr\u00e9sent) - [[Gina Efong\u00e9]]\n* [[Choc Stars]] (1983-2019) -  Bozi Boziana, [[Tshimpaka Roxy]] joined by [[Ben Nyamabo]], [[Carlyto Lassa]], [[Defao]]\n* [[L'Orchestre Anti-Choc]] (1985-Pr\u00e9sent) - Bozi Boziana, joined by [[Deyesse Mukangi]], [[Jolie Detta]], [[Dodoli]], [[Walingonda]], [[Fifi Mofude]], etc.\n* [[Langa Langa Stars]] (1981\u20131984) - Evoloko Jocker, Bozi Boziana, Tshimpaka Roxy and [[Djo Mali]]\n* [[Za\u00efko Langa Langa Nkolo Mboka]] - [[N'Yoka Longo]], [[Meridjo]], [[Dindo Yogo]], [[Oncle Bapius]], [[Gilbert Benamayi]], [[Zamuangana]], [[Nono Monzuluku]] and [[Matima]].

Dutch fur traders from [[New Amsterdam]] returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The original site was located on the south bank of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called [[Fort Hoop]] or the \"House of Hope.\" In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around Fort Hoop from the [[Pequot]] chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple families and a few dozen soldiers. The fort was abandoned by 1654, but the area is known today as Dutch Point; the name of the Dutch fort \"House of Hope\" is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sterner|first=Daniel|title=A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut |year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1-60949-635-3|page=81 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=x6QkVFi7l6UC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=sheldon+charter+oak+neighborhood#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=House of Hope |url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/ |publisher=The New Netherland Institute |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410075959/http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope |archive-date=April 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch outpost and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers who were stationed there did little to check the English migration, and the Dutch soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered.

Colt is often considered the father of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]] [[industrial revolution]], although there were a handful of small outfits already in operation by the time that he purchased a large tract of land in the area in the 1840s.\n\nIn 1836, Connecticut-born Colt received a U.S. patent for a revolver mechanism which enabled a gun to be fired multiple times without reloading. Sales were initially slow and his business ventures struggled. Then the U.S. government ordered 1,000 Colt revolvers in 1846, with the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] under way. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and he converted it into a corporation in 1855 under the name of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company]]. The original factory is situated in the Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood just south of [[downtown Hartford]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=Coltsville, USA: Inside America's Gun-Funded Utopia|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|accessdate=June 8, 2015|agency=Atlas Obscura|date=May 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516203640/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|archive-date=May 16, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith business booming by 1855, Colt entered an aggressive expansionary phase and opened the Colt Armory, the world's largest private armament factory. He employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. The Civil War led to a surge in demand, and Colt supplied the [[Union Army]]. Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company operated at full capacity and employed over 1,000 people in its Hartford factory. By that time, Colt had become one of the wealthiest men in America. He was presiding over his enterprise from [[Armsmear]], an ornate [[Italianate]] manor built near the armory in 1857. Upon his death in 1862, he was worth over $15&nbsp;million ($380&nbsp;million by 2015 standards).<ref name=\"Smith2004\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War|url=https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth|url-access=registration|date=November 2, 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-93477-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth/page/52 52]\u201353|access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nColt's methods were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and his successes secured Hartford's place as a major 19th century manufacturing center. It is estimated that his company produced over 400,000 revolvers in its first 25 years of manufacturing. His use of [[interchangeable parts]] helped him become one of the first to exploit the [[assembly line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehto|first1=Mark R.|last2=Buck|first2=James R.|title=Introduction to Human Factors and Ergonomics for Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5308-7|page=30}}</ref> Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing. His business practices were also innovative, involving a shrewd use of patents to protect his products, as well as new developments in marketing and business organization to create a highly successful business which long outlived him.\n\nElizabeth Colt inherited a controlling interest in her late husband's manufacturing company following his death in 1862. At the time, Colt firearms were producing an estimated 1/996th of the entire gross national product of the United States. She steered the company until 1901 with her brother [[Richard Jarvis]] as president, becoming one of the most prominent female industrialists in America. Together they transitioned the company from the end of the American Civil War into the 20th century, seeing the evolution from [[percussion cap|percussion]] revolvers to cartridge revolvers to [[semiautomatic pistol]]s and machineguns.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Colt legacy: the Colt Armory in Hartford, 1855\u20131980 |first= Ellsworth S.|last= Grant |pages=22, 58|publisher= Mowbray Co.|year= 1982|isbn =978-0-917218-17-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Colts left an indelible imprint on Hartford's architectural environment. Samuel Colt was inspired by what he had seen during a trip to London in 1851, and he embarked upon one of the boldest real estate development campaigns in Hartford's history. His intention was to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the Colt Armory. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked and lived alongside one another. [[Coltsville Historic District|Coltsville]] was among the first of America's 19th century [[company towns]], and it was easily the most advanced of its time\u2014though not the largest, the most prominent, or the most tightly controlled.

The invention of a new type of sewing machine led to a new application of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the [[Colt Armory]] in nearby Coltsville in size.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2007 193\u2013196\"/> Weed eventually became the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.\n\nIndustrialist [[Albert Augustus Pope|Albert Pope]] was inspired by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]], and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States.

Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.\n\nIn an effort to save his business, Pope opened a motor carriage department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the \"Mark III\" in 1897.

Dutch fur traders from [[New Amsterdam]] returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The original site was located on the south bank of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called [[Fort Hoop]] or the \"House of Hope.\" In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around Fort Hoop from the [[Pequot]] chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple families and a few dozen soldiers. The fort was abandoned by 1654, but the area is known today as Dutch Point; the name of the Dutch fort \"House of Hope\" is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sterner|first=Daniel|title=A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut |year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1-60949-635-3|page=81 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=x6QkVFi7l6UC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=sheldon+charter+oak+neighborhood#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=House of Hope |url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/ |publisher=The New Netherland Institute |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410075959/http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope |archive-date=April 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch outpost and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers who were stationed there did little to check the English migration, and the Dutch soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered. The House of Hope remained an outpost, but it was steadily swallowed up by waves of English settlers. In 1650, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] met with English representatives to negotiate a permanent boundary between the Dutch and English colonies; the line that they agreed on was more than {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of the original settlement.\n\nThe English began to arrive in 1636, settling upstream from Fort Hoop near the present-day Downtown and Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Scaeva\n | title = Hartford in the Olden Time, Its First Thirty Years\n | publisher = F.A.

Therefore, Hooker delivered a sermon that inspired the writing of the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], a document ratified January 14, 1639 which invested the people with the authority to govern, rather than ceding such authority to a higher power.

Colt is often considered the father of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]] [[industrial revolution]], although there were a handful of small outfits already in operation by the time that he purchased a large tract of land in the area in the 1840s.\n\nIn 1836, Connecticut-born Colt received a U.S. patent for a revolver mechanism which enabled a gun to be fired multiple times without reloading. Sales were initially slow and his business ventures struggled. Then the U.S. government ordered 1,000 Colt revolvers in 1846, with the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] under way. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and he converted it into a corporation in 1855 under the name of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company]]. The original factory is situated in the Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood just south of [[downtown Hartford]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=Coltsville, USA: Inside America's Gun-Funded Utopia|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|accessdate=June 8, 2015|agency=Atlas Obscura|date=May 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516203640/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/coltsville_abandoned_utopian_guns_village|archive-date=May 16, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith business booming by 1855, Colt entered an aggressive expansionary phase and opened the Colt Armory, the world's largest private armament factory. He employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. The Civil War led to a surge in demand, and Colt supplied the [[Union Army]]. Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company operated at full capacity and employed over 1,000 people in its Hartford factory. By that time, Colt had become one of the wealthiest men in America. He was presiding over his enterprise from [[Armsmear]], an ornate [[Italianate]] manor built near the armory in 1857. Upon his death in 1862, he was worth over $15&nbsp;million ($380&nbsp;million by 2015 standards).<ref name=\"Smith2004\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War|url=https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth|url-access=registration|date=November 2, 2004|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-93477-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/machinegunstoryo00anth/page/52 52]\u201353|access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nColt's methods were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and his successes secured Hartford's place as a major 19th century manufacturing center. It is estimated that his company produced over 400,000 revolvers in its first 25 years of manufacturing. His use of [[interchangeable parts]] helped him become one of the first to exploit the [[assembly line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehto|first1=Mark R.|last2=Buck|first2=James R.|title=Introduction to Human Factors and Ergonomics for Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5308-7|page=30}}</ref> Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing. His business practices were also innovative, involving a shrewd use of patents to protect his products, as well as new developments in marketing and business organization to create a highly successful business which long outlived him.\n\nElizabeth Colt inherited a controlling interest in her late husband's manufacturing company following his death in 1862. At the time, Colt firearms were producing an estimated 1/996th of the entire gross national product of the United States. She steered the company until 1901 with her brother [[Richard Jarvis]] as president, becoming one of the most prominent female industrialists in America. Together they transitioned the company from the end of the American Civil War into the 20th century, seeing the evolution from [[percussion cap|percussion]] revolvers to cartridge revolvers to [[semiautomatic pistol]]s and machineguns.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Colt legacy: the Colt Armory in Hartford, 1855\u20131980 |first= Ellsworth S.|last= Grant |pages=22, 58|publisher= Mowbray Co.|year= 1982|isbn =978-0-917218-17-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Colts left an indelible imprint on Hartford's architectural environment. Samuel Colt was inspired by what he had seen during a trip to London in 1851, and he embarked upon one of the boldest real estate development campaigns in Hartford's history. His intention was to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the Colt Armory. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked and lived alongside one another. [[Coltsville Historic District|Coltsville]] was among the first of America's 19th century [[company towns]], and it was easily the most advanced of its time\u2014though not the largest, the most prominent, or the most tightly controlled.

The invention of a new type of sewing machine led to a new application of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the [[Colt Armory]] in nearby Coltsville in size.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2007 193\u2013196\"/> Weed eventually became the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.\n\nIndustrialist [[Albert Augustus Pope|Albert Pope]] was inspired by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]], and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invention hot spot: Beginnings of mass production in 19th-century Hartford, Connecticut |url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |website=invention.smithsonian.org |publisher=Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=August 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083138/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |archivedate=August 19, 2014 }}</ref> Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.\n\nIn an effort to save his business, Pope opened a motor carriage department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the \"Mark III\" in 1897.

Mayor [[Eddie Perez (politician)|Eddie Perez]] was first elected in 2001 and was re-elected with 76% of the vote in 2003. As the first strong mayor elected under the revised charter, he is widely credited with reducing crime, reforming the school system, and sparking economic revitalization in the city.

{"title_page": "Presidential system", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{Systems of government}}\nA '''presidential system''' is a [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[republic]]an [[government]] in which a [[head of government]] leads an [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] that is separate from the [[legislative branch]]. This head of government is in most cases also the [[head of state]], which is called ''[[President (government title)|president]]''\n\nIn presidential countries, the executive is [[Election|elected]] and is not [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the legislature, which cannot in normal circumstances [[Dissolution of parliament|dismiss]] it. Such dismissal is possible, however, in uncommon cases, often through [[impeachment]].\n\nThe title \"[[President (government title)|president]]\" has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body, as with the [[President of the Continental Congress]] in the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|early United States]], prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government.\n\nA presidential system contrasts with a [[parliamentary system]], where the head of government comes to power by gaining the confidence of an elected [[legislature]]. There is also a hybrid system called [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidentialism]].\n\nCountries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president. Heads of state of [[parliamentary republic]]s, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. [[Dictator]]s or leaders of [[one-party state]]s, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.\n\nPresidentialism is the dominant form of government in the mainland [[Americas]], with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics, with the exception of [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Belize|Belize]], and [[Politics of Suriname|Suriname]] ([[South America]] is also the only continent in the world to have no monarchies). It is also prevalent in [[Central Africa|Central]] and southern [[West Africa]] and in [[Central Asia]]. There are no presidential republics in Europe (whether nominally or in practice), with the exception for [[politics of Turkey|Turkey]], [[politics of Belarus|Belarus]], France and [[Politics of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Oceania also has no presidential republics.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIn a full-fledged presidential system, a politician is chosen directly by the public or indirectly by the winning party to be the [[head of government]]. Except for [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]], this head of government is also the [[head of state]], and is therefore called ''president''. The post of [[prime minister]] (also called premier) may also exist in a presidential system, but unlike in [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] or parliamentary systems, the prime minister answers to the president and not to the legislature.\n\nThe following characteristics apply generally for the numerous presidential governments across the world:\n* The executive can [[veto]] legislative acts and, in turn, a [[supermajority]] of lawmakers may override the veto. The veto is generally derived from the [[United Kingdom|British]] tradition of [[royal assent]] in which an act of parliament can only be enacted with the assent of the [[British monarchy|monarch]].\n* The president has a fixed term of office. Elections are held at regular times and cannot be triggered by a [[vote of confidence]] or other parliamentary procedures, although in some countries there is an exception which provides for the removal of a president who is found to have broken a law.\n* The executive branch is unipersonal. Members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] serve at the pleasure of the president and must carry out the policies of the executive and legislative branches. Cabinet ministers or executive departmental chiefs are not members of the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, presidential systems often need legislative approval of executive nominations to the cabinet, [[judicial review|judiciary]], and various lower governmental posts. A president generally can direct members of the cabinet, military, or any officer or employee of the executive branch, but cannot direct or dismiss judges.\n* The president can often [[pardon]] or [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] sentences of convicted criminals.\n\n== Subnational governments of the world ==\n{{See also|State governments of the United States}}\nSubnational governments, usually states, may be structured as presidential systems. All of the state governments in the United States use the presidential system, even though this is not constitutionally required. On a local level, many cities use [[council-manager government]], which is equivalent to a parliamentary system, although the post of a [[city manager]] is normally a non-political position. Some countries without a presidential system at the national level use a form of this system at a subnational or local level. One example is [[Japan]], where the national government uses the parliamentary system, but the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal governments]] have governors and mayors elected independently from local assemblies and councils.\n\n== Advantages ==\nSupporters generally claim four basic advantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Direct elections''' \u2014 in a presidential system, the president is often elected directly by the people. This makes the president's power more legitimate than that of a leader appointed indirectly. However, this is not a necessary feature of a presidential system. Some presidential states have an indirectly elected head of state.\n* '''Separation of powers''' \u2014 a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. This allows each structure to monitor and check the other, preventing abuses of power.\n* '''Speed and decisiveness''' \u2014 A president with strong powers can usually enact changes quickly. However, the separation of powers can also slow the system down.\n* '''Stability''' \u2014 a president, by virtue of a fixed term, may provide more stability than a prime minister, who can be dismissed at any time.\n\n=== Direct elections ===\nIn most presidential systems, the president is elected by popular vote, although some such as the [[United States]] use an [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] (which is itself directly elected) or some other method.<ref>The \"presidential\" model implies that the Chief Executive is elected by all those members of the electoral body: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Titolo V e \"forme di governo\": il caso Abruzzo (dopo la Calabria)|journal= Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89381752}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>  By this method, the president receives a personal mandate to lead the country, whereas in a parliamentary system a candidate might only receive a personal mandate to represent a constituency. That means a president can only be elected independently of the legislative branch.\n\n=== Separation of powers ===\nA presidential system's separation of the executive from the legislature is sometimes held up as an advantage, in that each branch may scrutinize the actions of the other. In a parliamentary system, the executive is drawn from the legislature, making criticism of one by the other considerably less likely. A formal condemnation of the executive by the legislature is often considered a [[vote of no confidence]]. According to supporters of the presidential system, the lack of checks and balances means that misconduct by a prime minister may never be discovered. Writing about [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], [[Woodrow Wyatt]], a former MP in the UK, said \"don't think a Watergate couldn't happen here, you just wouldn't hear about it.\" (ibid)\n\nCritics respond that if a presidential system's legislature is controlled by the president's party, the same situation exists. Proponents{{Who|date=March 2017}} note that even in such a situation a legislator from the president's party is in a better position to criticize the president or his policies should he deem it necessary, since the immediate security of the president's position is less dependent on legislative support. In parliamentary systems, [[party discipline]] is much more strictly enforced. If a parliamentary [[backbencher]] publicly criticizes the executive or its policies to any significant extent then he/she faces a much higher prospect of losing his/her party's nomination, or even outright expulsion from the party. Even mild criticism from a backbencher could carry consequences serious enough (in particular, removal from consideration for a cabinet post) to effectively muzzle a legislator with any serious political ambitions.\n\nDespite the existence of the no confidence vote, in practice it is extremely difficult to stop a prime minister or cabinet that has made its decision. In a parliamentary system, if important legislation proposed by the incumbent prime minister and his cabinet is \"voted down\" by a majority of the members of parliament then it is considered a vote of no confidence. To emphasize that particular point, a prime minister will often declare a particular legislative vote to be a matter of confidence at the first sign of reluctance on the part of legislators from his or her own party. If a government loses a parliamentary vote of confidence, then the incumbent government must then either resign or call elections to be held, a consequence few backbenchers are willing to endure. Hence, a no confidence vote in some parliamentary countries, like Britain, only occurs a few times in a century. In 1931, [[David Lloyd George]] told a select committee: \"Parliament has really no control over the executive; it is a pure fiction.\" (Schlesinger 1982)\n\nBy contrast, if a presidential legislative initiative fails to pass a legislature controlled by the president's party (e.g. the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]] in the United States), it may damage the president's political standing and that of his party, but generally has no immediate effect on whether or not the president completes his term.\n\n=== Speed and decisiveness ===\nSome supporters of presidential systems claim{{Who|date=September 2016}} that presidential systems can respond more rapidly to emerging situations than parliamentary ones. A prime minister, when taking action, needs to retain the support of the legislature, but a president is often less constrained. In ''[[Why England Slept]]'', future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] argued that British prime ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] were constrained by the need to maintain the confidence of the Commons.\n\nOther supporters of presidential systems sometimes argue in the exact opposite direction, however, saying that presidential systems can slow decision-making to beneficial ends. Divided government, where the presidency and the legislature are controlled by different parties, is said to restrain the excesses of both the coalition and opposition, and guarantee cross-partisan input into legislation. In the United States, Republican Congressman [[Bill Frenzel]] wrote in 1995:\n\n{{quote|\"There are some of us who think [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] is the best thing since indoor plumbing. Gridlock is the natural gift the Framers of the Constitution gave us so that the country would not be subjected to policy swings resulting from the whimsy of the public. And the competition\u2014whether multi-branch, multi-level, or multi-house\u2014is important to those checks and balances and to our ongoing kind of centrist government. Thank heaven we do not have a government that nationalizes one year and privatizes next year, and so on ''ad infinitum''\". (Checks and Balances, 8)}}\n\n=== Stability ===\nAlthough most parliamentary governments go long periods of time without a no confidence vote, [[Italy]], [[Israel]], and the [[French Fourth Republic]] have all experienced difficulties maintaining stability. When parliamentary systems have multiple parties, and governments are forced to rely on coalitions, as they often do in nations that use a system of [[proportional representation]], extremist parties can theoretically use the threat of leaving a coalition to further their agendas.\n\nMany people consider presidential systems more able to survive emergencies. A country under enormous stress may, supporters argue, be better off being led by a president with a fixed term than rotating premierships. [[France]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian controversy]] switched to a [[semi-presidential system]] as did [[Sri Lanka]] during its civil war, while [[Israel]] experimented with a directly elected [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]] in 1992. In France and Sri Lanka, the results are widely considered to have been positive. However, in the case of Israel, an unprecedented proliferation of smaller parties occurred, leading to the restoration of the previous system of selecting a prime minister.\n\nThe fact that elections are fixed in a presidential system is considered by supporters a welcome \"check\" on the powers of the executive, contrasting parliamentary systems, which may allow the prime minister to call elections whenever they see fit or orchestrate their own vote of no confidence to trigger an election when they cannot get a legislative item passed. The presidential model is said to discourage this sort of opportunism, and instead forces the executive to operate within the confines of a term they cannot alter to suit their own needs. <!-- Theoretically, if a president's positions and actions have had a positive impact on their respective country, then it is likely that their party's candidate (possibly the sitting president) will be elected for another term in office. [This, of course, also applies in a parliamentary system.] -->\n\nProponents of the presidential system also argue that stability extends to the cabinets chosen under the system, compared to a parliamentary system where cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch.  Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates.  This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based as much or more on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister.  Supporters of the presidential system note that parliamentary systems are prone{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} to disruptive \"[[cabinet shuffle]]s\" where legislators are moved between portfolios, whereas in presidential system cabinets (such as the [[United States Cabinet]]), cabinet shuffles are unusual.\n\n== Criticism and disadvantages ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}\nCritics generally claim three basic disadvantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Tendency towards authoritarianism''' \u2013 some political scientists say presidentialism raises the stakes of elections, exacerbates their polarization and can lead to authoritarianism (Linz).\n* '''Political gridlock''' \u2013 the separation of powers of a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. Critics argue that this can create an undesirable and long-term [[gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]] whenever the president and the legislative majority are from different parties, which is common because the electorate usually expects more rapid results from new policies than are possible (Linz, Mainwaring and Shugart). In addition, this reduces accountability by allowing the president and the legislature to shift blame to each other.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy, AP* Edition \u2013 2016 Presidential Election, 17th Edition|last=George|first=Edwards|last2=Warrenberg|first2=Martin|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|year=2016|isbn=9780134586571|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n* '''Impediments to leadership change''' \u2013 presidential systems often make it difficult to remove a president from office early, for example after taking actions that become unpopular.\n\nA fourth criticism applies specifically to nations with a proportionally elected legislature and a presidency. Where the voters are virtually all represented by their votes in the proportional outcome, the presidency is elected on a winner-take-all basis. Two different electoral systems are therefore in play, potentially leading to conflicts that are based on the natural differences of the systems.\n\n=== Tendency towards authoritarianism ===\nA prime minister without majority support in the legislature must either form a coalition or, if able to lead a minority government, govern in a manner acceptable to at least some of the opposition parties. Even with a majority government, the prime minister must still govern within (perhaps unwritten) constraints as determined by the members of his party\u2014a premier in this situation is often at greater risk of losing his party leadership than his party is at risk of losing the next election. On the other hand, winning the presidency is a winner-take-all, [[zero-sum game]]. Once elected, a president might be able to marginalize the influence of other parties and exclude rival factions in his own party as well, or even leave the party whose ticket he was elected under. The president can thus rule without any party support until the next election or abuse his power to win multiple terms, a worrisome situation for many interest groups. Yale political scientist [[Juan Linz]] argues that:\n\n{{quote|The danger that zero-sum presidential elections pose is compounded by the rigidity of the president's fixed term in office. Winners and losers are sharply defined for the entire period of the presidential mandate&nbsp;... losers must wait four or five years without any access to executive power and patronage. The zero-sum game in presidential regimes raises the stakes of presidential elections and inevitably exacerbates their attendant tension and polarization.}}\n\nConstitutions that only require [[Plurality voting system|plurality support]] are said{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be especially undesirable, as significant power can be vested in a person who does not enjoy support from a majority of the population.\n\nSome political scientists say that presidential systems are not constitutionally stable and have difficulty sustaining democratic practices, noting that presidentialism has slipped into authoritarianism in many of the countries in which it has been implemented. According to political scientist [[Fred Riggs]], presidentialism has fallen into authoritarianism in nearly every country it has been attempted.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1997|title=Presidentialism versus Parliamentarism: Implications for Representativeness and Legitimacy|jstor=1601343|journal=International Political Science Review |volume= 18| issue =  3|page=258|last1=Riggs|first1=Fred W.|doi=10.1177/019251297018003003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=1994|title=Conceptual homogenization of a heterogeneous field: Presidentialism in comparative perspective|journal=Comparing Nations: Concepts, Strategies, Substance|pages=72\u2013152}}</ref> Political sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] pointed out that this has taken place in political cultures not conducive to democracy and that militaries have tended to play a prominent role in most of these countries. On the other hand, an often-cited{{By whom|date=January 2012}} [[How Democratic Is the American Constitution?#List of countries steadily democratic since at least 1950|list of the world's 22 older democracies]] includes only two countries ([[Costa Rica]] and the [[United States]]) with presidential systems.\n\nIn a presidential system, the legislature and the president have equal mandates from the public. Conflicts between the branches of government might not be reconciled. When president and legislature disagree and government is not working effectively, there is a strong incentive to use extra-constitutional measures to break the deadlock.  Of the [[separation of powers|three common branches]] of government, the executive is in the best position to use extra-constitutional measures, especially when the president is head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the military. By contrast, in a parliamentary system where the often-ceremonial head of state is either a constitutional monarch or (in the case of a parliamentary republic) an experienced and respected figure, given some political emergency there is a good chance that even a ceremonial head of state will be able to use emergency [[reserve powers]] to restrain a head of government acting in an emergency extra-constitutional manner \u2013 this is only possible because the head of state and the head of government are not the same person.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Dana D.

This is common because the electorate often expects more rapid results than are possible from new policies and switches to a different party at the next election.<ref name=\":0\" /> Critics such as [[Juan Linz]], argue that this inherent political instability can cause democracies to fail, as seen in such cases as Brazil and Chile.<ref>Linz, J. (1990). The perils of presidentialism. The journal of democracy, Volume 1(1), pp. 51-69.</ref>\n\n==== Lack of accountability ====\nIn such cases of gridlock, presidential systems are said by critics<ref>Linz, J. (1985). Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference. Connecticut: Yale university press</ref> not to offer voters the kind of accountability seen in parliamentary systems. It is easy for either the president or the legislature to escape blame by shifting it to the other. Describing the United States, former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] said \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=James|title=Constitutional Reform and Effective Government|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1/page/11 11]}}</ref> Years before becoming President, [[Woodrow Wilson]] (at the time, a fierce critic of the U.S. system of government) famously wrote \"how is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?\"<ref name=PhD_pp186-187>Wilson, ''Congressional Government'' (1885), pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nAn example is the increase in the [[US public debt|federal debt of the United States]] that occurred during the presidency of Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]. Arguably, the deficits were the product of a bargain between President Reagan and the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[Tip O'Neill]]. O'Neill agreed to tax cuts favored by Reagan, and in exchange Reagan agreed to budgets that did not restrain spending to his liking. In such a scenario, each side can say they are displeased with the debt, plausibly blame the other side for the deficit, and still claim success.\n\n=== Impediments to leadership change ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAnother alleged problem of presidentialism is that it is often difficult to remove a president from office early. Even if a president is \"proved to be inefficient, even if he becomes unpopular, even if his policy is unacceptable to the majority of his countrymen, he and his methods must be endured until the moment comes for a new election\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> [[John Tyler]] was elected vice president and assumed the presidency because [[William Henry Harrison]] died after thirty days in office. Tyler blocked the Whig agenda, was loathed by his nominal party, but remained firmly in control of the executive branch. Most presidential systems provide no legal means to remove a president simply for being unpopular or even for behaving in a manner that might be considered unethical or immoral provided it is not illegal. This has been cited{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} as the reason why many presidential countries have experienced military coups to remove a leader who is said to have lost his mandate.\n\nParliamentary systems can quickly remove unpopular leaders by a [[vote of no confidence]], a procedure that serves as a \"pressure release valve\" for political tension. Votes of no confidence are easier to achieve in [[minority government]] situations, but even if the unpopular leader heads a [[majority government]], he or she is often in a less secure position than a president. Usually in parliamentary systems a basic premise is that if a premier's popularity sustains a serious enough blow and the premier does not as a matter of consequence offer to resign prior to the next election, then those members of parliament who would persist in supporting the premier will be at serious risk of losing their seats. Therefore, especially in parliaments with a strong party system, other prominent members of the premier's party have a strong incentive to initiate a leadership challenge in hopes of mitigating damage to their party. More often than not, a premier facing a serious challenge resolves to save face by [[resignation|resigning]] before being formally removed\u2014[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s relinquishing of her premiership being a prominent example.\n\nOn the other hand, while removing a president through [[impeachment]] is allowed by most constitutions, impeachment proceedings often can be initiated only in cases where the president has violated the constitution or broken the law. Impeachment is often made difficult; by comparison the removal a party leader is normally governed by the (often less formal) rules of the party. Nearly all parties (including governing parties) have a relatively simple process for removing their leaders.\n\nFurthermore, even when impeachment proceedings against a sitting president are successful, whether by causing his removal from office or by compelling his resignation, the legislature usually has little or no discretion in determining the ousted president's successor, since presidential systems usually adhere to a rigid succession process which is enforced the same way regardless of how a vacancy in the presidency comes about. The usual outcome of a presidency becoming vacant is that a vice president automatically succeeds to the presidency. Vice presidents are usually chosen by the president, whether as a running mate who elected alongside the president or appointed by a sitting president, so that when a vice president succeeds to the presidency it is probable that he will continue many or all the policies of the former president. A prominent example of such an accession would be the elevation of Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] to the U.S. Presidency after [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to resign in the face of virtually certain impeachment and removal, a succession that took place notwithstanding the fact that Ford had only assumed the Vice Presidency after being appointed by Nixon to replace [[Spiro Agnew]], who had also resigned due to scandal. In some cases, particularly when the would-be successor to a presidency is seen by legislators as no better (or even worse) than a president they wish to see removed, there may be a strong incentive to abstain from pursuing impeachment proceedings even if there are legal grounds to do so.\n\nSince prime ministers in parliamentary systems must always retain the confidence of the legislature, in cases where a prime minister suddenly leaves office there is little point in anyone without a reasonable prospect of gaining that legislative confidence attempting to assume the premiership. This ensures that whenever a premiership becomes vacant (or is about to become vacant), legislators from the premier's party will always play a key role in determining the leader's permanent successor. In theory this could be interpreted to support an argument that a parliamentary party ought to have the power to elect their party leader directly, and indeed, at least historically, parliamentary system parties' leadership electoral procedures usually called for the party's legislative caucus to fill a leadership vacancy by electing a new leader directly by and from amongst themselves, and for the whole succession process to be completed within as short a time frame as practical. Today, however, such a system is not commonly practiced and most parliamentary system parties' rules provide for a leadership election in which the general membership of the party is permitted to vote at some point in the process (either directly for the new leader or for delegates who then elect the new leader in a convention), though in many cases the party's legislators are allowed to exercise a disproportionate influence in the final vote.\n\nWhenever a leadership election becomes necessary on account of a vacancy arising suddenly, an interim leader (often informally called the ''interim prime minister'' in cases where this involves a governing party) will be selected by the parliamentary party, usually with the stipulation or expectation that the interim leader will not be a candidate for the permanent leadership. Some parties, such as the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], employ some combination of both aforementioned electoral processes to select a new leader. In any event, a prime minister who is forced to leave office due to scandal or similar circumstance will usually have little if any ability to influence his party on the final selection of a new leader and anyone seen to be having close ties to such a prime minister will have limited if any serious prospect of being elected the new leader. Even in cases when an outgoing prime minister is leaving office voluntarily, it is often frowned on for an outgoing or former premier to engage in any overt attempt to influence the election (for example, by endorsing a candidate in the leadership election), in part because a party in the process of selecting a new leader usually has a strong incentive to foster a competitive leadership election in order to stimulate interest and participation in the election, which in turn encourages the sale of party memberships and support for the party in general.\n\n[[Walter Bagehot]] criticized presidentialism because it does not allow a transfer in power in the event of an emergency.\n\n{{quote|Under a cabinet constitution at a sudden emergency the people can choose a ruler for the occasion. It is quite possible and even likely that he would not be ruler before the occasion. The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid energy, the eager nature fit for a great crisis are not required\u2014are impediments\u2014in common times. A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday politics than a Chatham\u2014a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon. By the structure of the world we want, at the sudden occurrence of a grave tempest, to change the helmsman\u2014to replace the pilot of the calm by the pilot of the storm.\n\nBut under a presidential government you can do nothing of the kind. The American government calls itself a government of the supreme people; but at a quick crisis, the time when a sovereign power is most needed, you cannot find the supreme people. You have got a congress elected for one fixed period, going out perhaps by fixed installments, which cannot be accelerated or retarded\u2014you have a president chosen for a fixed period, and immovable during that period:&nbsp;... there is no elastic element&nbsp;... you have bespoken your government in advance, and whether it is what you want or not, by law you must keep it&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Bagehot\">{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=The Cabinet}}</ref>}}\n\nOpponents{{who|date=August 2012}} of the presidential system note that years later, Bagehot's observation came to life during World War II, when [[Neville Chamberlain]] was replaced with [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nHowever, supporters of the presidential system question the validity of the point. They argue that if presidents were not able to command some considerable level of security in their tenures, their [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandates]] would be worthless. They further counter that republics such as the United States have successfully endured war and other crises without the need to change heads of state. Supporters argue that presidents elected in a time of peace and prosperity have proven themselves perfectly capable of responding effectively to a serious crisis, largely due to their ability to make the necessary appointments to his cabinet and elsewhere in government or by creating new positions to deal with new challenges. One prominent, recent example would be the appointment of a [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.\n\nSome supporters of the presidential system counter that impediments to a leadership change, being that they are little more than an unavoidable consequence of the [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandate]] afforded to a president, are thus a ''strength'' instead of a weakness in times of crisis.  In such times, a prime minister might hesitate due to the need to keep parliament's support, whereas a president can act without fear of removal from office by those who might disapprove of his actions. Furthermore, even if a prime minister does manage to successfully resolve a crisis (or multiple crises), that does not guarantee and he or she will possess the political capital needed to remain in office for a similar, future crisis. Unlike what would be possible in a presidential system, a perceived crisis in the parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers or rivals an opportunity to launch a vexing challenge for a prime minister's leadership.\n\nFinally, many{{who|date=August 2012}} have criticized presidential systems for their alleged slowness to respond to their citizens' needs. Often, the checks and balances make action difficult. [[Walter Bagehot]] said of the American system, \"the executive is crippled by not getting the law it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by having to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for its name, since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature is demoralized by liberty, by taking decisions of others [and not itself] will suffer the effects\".<ref name=\"Bagehot\" />\n\nDefenders of presidential systems argue that a parliamentary system operating in a jurisdiction with strong ethnic or sectarian tensions will tend to ignore the interests of minorities or even treat them with contempt \u2013 the first half century of government in [[Northern Ireland]] is often cited as an example \u2013 whereas presidential systems ensure that minority wishes and rights cannot be disregarded, thus preventing a \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\" and vice versa protect the wishes and rights of the majority from abuse by a legislature or an executive that holds a contrary viewpoint especially when there are frequent, scheduled elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} On the other hand, supporters of parliamentary systems contend that the strength and independence of the judiciary is the more decisive factor when it comes to protection of minority rights.\n\nBritish-Irish philosopher and MP [[Edmund Burke]] stated that an official should be elected based on \"his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience\", and therefore should reflect on the arguments for and against certain policies before taking positions and then act out on what an official would believe is best in the long run for one's constituents and country as a whole even if it means short-term backlash. Thus defenders of presidential systems hold that sometimes what is [[Trustee model of representation|wisest may not always be the most popular decision]] and vice versa.\n\n== Differences from a parliamentary system ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nA number of key theoretical differences exist between a presidential and a parliamentary system:\n* In a presidential system, the central principle is that the [[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]] and judicial branches of government are separate. This leads to the separate election of president, who is elected to office for a fixed term, and only removable for gross misdemeanor by [[impeachment]] and dismissal. By contrast, in [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], the executive branch is led by a council of ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who are directly accountable to the legislature and often have their background in the legislature (regardless of whether it is called a \"parliament\", an \"assembly\", a \"diet\", or a \"chamber\").\n* As with the president's set term of office, the legislature also exists for a set term of office and cannot be dissolved ahead of schedule. By contrast, in parliamentary systems, the prime minister needs to survive a vote of confidence otherwise a new election must be called. The legislature can typically be dissolved at any stage during its life by the head of state, usually on the advice of either Prime Minister alone, by the Prime Minister and cabinet, or by the cabinet.\n* In a presidential system, the president usually has special privileges in the enactment of legislation, namely the possession of a power of [[veto]] over legislation of bills, in some cases subject to the power of the legislature by weighted majority to override the veto. The legislature and the president are thus expected to serve as [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on each other's powers.\n* Presidential system presidents may also be given a great deal of constitutional authority in the exercise of the office of [[Commander in Chief]], a constitutional title given to most presidents. In addition, the presidential power to receive ambassadors as head of state is usually interpreted as giving the president broad powers to conduct [[foreign policy]]. Though semi-presidential systems may reduce a president's power over day-to-day government affairs, semi-presidential systems commonly give the president power over foreign policy.\n* Parliamentary systems certainly provide greater flexibility in the process of transition to any consolidation of democracy.<ref>Linz, J. (1985) Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference? Connecticut: Yale university press.</ref>\n\nPresidential systems also have fewer ideological parties than parliamentary systems. Sometimes in the United States, the policies preferred by the two parties have been very similar (but ''see also'' [[polarization (politics)|polarization]]). In the 1950s, during the leadership of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Senate Democrats included the [[right-wing politics|right]]-most members of the chamber\u2014[[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]] and [[Strom Thurmond]], and the [[left-wing politics|left]]-most members\u2014[[Paul Douglas]] and [[Herbert Lehman]]. This pattern does not prevail in Latin American presidential democracies.\n\n=== Overlapping elements ===\nIn practice, elements of both systems overlap. Though a president in a presidential system does not have to choose a government under the legislature, the legislature may have the right to scrutinize his or her appointments to high governmental office, with the right, on some occasions, to block an appointment. In the [[United States]], many appointments must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], although once confirmed an appointee can only be removed against the president's will through [[impeachment]]. By contrast, though answerable ''to'' parliament, a parliamentary system's cabinet may be able to make use of the parliamentary '[[Whip (politics)|whip]]' (an obligation on party members in parliament to vote with their party) to control and dominate parliament, reducing parliament's ability to control the government.\n\n==Republics with a presidential system of government==\n{{main|List of countries by system of government#Presidential systems}}\n\n''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n* {{flag|Angola}}\n* {{flag|Argentina}}\n* {{flag|Benin}}\n* {{flag|Belarus}}\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}\n* {{flag|Brazil}}\n* {{flag|Burundi}}\n* {{flag|Chad}}\n* {{flag|Chile}}\n* {{flag|Colombia}}\n* {{flag|Comoros}}\n* {{flag|Costa Rica}}\n* {{flag|Cyprus}}\n* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}\n* {{flag|El Salvador}}\n* {{flag|Gambia}}\n* {{flag|Ghana}}\n* {{flag|Guatemala}}\n* {{flag|Honduras}}\n* {{flag|Indonesia}}\n* {{flag|Kenya}}\n* {{flag|Liberia}}\n* {{flag|Malawi}}\n* {{flag|Maldives}}\n* {{flag|Mexico}}\n* {{flag|Nicaragua}}\n* {{flag|Nigeria}}\n* {{flag|Palau}}\n* {{flag|Panama}}\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}\n* {{flag|Peru}}\n* {{flag|Philippines}}\n* {{flag|Senegal}}\n* {{flag|Seychelles}}\n* {{flag|Sierra Leone}}\n* {{flag|South Sudan}}\n* {{flag|Turkey}}\n* {{flag|Turkmenistan}}\n* {{flag|United States}}\n* {{flag|Uruguay}}\n* {{flag|Venezuela}}\n* {{flag|Zambia}}\n* {{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Presidential systems with a prime minister===\nThe following countries have presidential systems where a post of [[prime minister]] (official title may vary) exists alongside that of president.

Heads of state of [[parliamentary republic]]s, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. [[Dictator]]s or leaders of [[one-party state]]s, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.\n\nPresidentialism is the dominant form of government in the mainland [[Americas]], with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics, with the exception of [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Belize|Belize]], and [[Politics of Suriname|Suriname]] ([[South America]] is also the only continent in the world to have no monarchies). It is also prevalent in [[Central Africa|Central]] and southern [[West Africa]] and in [[Central Asia]]. There are no presidential republics in Europe (whether nominally or in practice), with the exception for [[politics of Turkey|Turkey]], [[politics of Belarus|Belarus]], France and [[Politics of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Oceania also has no presidential republics.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIn a full-fledged presidential system, a politician is chosen directly by the public or indirectly by the winning party to be the [[head of government]]. Except for [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]], this head of government is also the [[head of state]], and is therefore called ''president''. The post of [[prime minister]] (also called premier) may also exist in a presidential system, but unlike in [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] or parliamentary systems, the prime minister answers to the president and not to the legislature.\n\nThe following characteristics apply generally for the numerous presidential governments across the world:\n* The executive can [[veto]] legislative acts and, in turn, a [[supermajority]] of lawmakers may override the veto. The veto is generally derived from the [[United Kingdom|British]] tradition of [[royal assent]] in which an act of parliament can only be enacted with the assent of the [[British monarchy|monarch]].\n* The president has a fixed term of office. Elections are held at regular times and cannot be triggered by a [[vote of confidence]] or other parliamentary procedures, although in some countries there is an exception which provides for the removal of a president who is found to have broken a law.\n* The executive branch is unipersonal. Members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] serve at the pleasure of the president and must carry out the policies of the executive and legislative branches. Cabinet ministers or executive departmental chiefs are not members of the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, presidential systems often need legislative approval of executive nominations to the cabinet, [[judicial review|judiciary]], and various lower governmental posts. A president generally can direct members of the cabinet, military, or any officer or employee of the executive branch, but cannot direct or dismiss judges.\n* The president can often [[pardon]] or [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] sentences of convicted criminals.\n\n== Subnational governments of the world ==\n{{See also|State governments of the United States}}\nSubnational governments, usually states, may be structured as presidential systems. All of the state governments in the United States use the presidential system, even though this is not constitutionally required. On a local level, many cities use [[council-manager government]], which is equivalent to a parliamentary system, although the post of a [[city manager]] is normally a non-political position. Some countries without a presidential system at the national level use a form of this system at a subnational or local level. One example is [[Japan]], where the national government uses the parliamentary system, but the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal governments]] have governors and mayors elected independently from local assemblies and councils.\n\n== Advantages ==\nSupporters generally claim four basic advantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Direct elections''' \u2014 in a presidential system, the president is often elected directly by the people. This makes the president's power more legitimate than that of a leader appointed indirectly. However, this is not a necessary feature of a presidential system. Some presidential states have an indirectly elected head of state.\n* '''Separation of powers''' \u2014 a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. This allows each structure to monitor and check the other, preventing abuses of power.\n* '''Speed and decisiveness''' \u2014 A president with strong powers can usually enact changes quickly. However, the separation of powers can also slow the system down.\n* '''Stability''' \u2014 a president, by virtue of a fixed term, may provide more stability than a prime minister, who can be dismissed at any time.\n\n=== Direct elections ===\nIn most presidential systems, the president is elected by popular vote, although some such as the [[United States]] use an [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] (which is itself directly elected) or some other method.<ref>The \"presidential\" model implies that the Chief Executive is elected by all those members of the electoral body: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Titolo V e \"forme di governo\": il caso Abruzzo (dopo la Calabria)|journal= Diritto&Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89381752}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>  By this method, the president receives a personal mandate to lead the country, whereas in a parliamentary system a candidate might only receive a personal mandate to represent a constituency. That means a president can only be elected independently of the legislative branch.\n\n=== Separation of powers ===\nA presidential system's separation of the executive from the legislature is sometimes held up as an advantage, in that each branch may scrutinize the actions of the other. In a parliamentary system, the executive is drawn from the legislature, making criticism of one by the other considerably less likely. A formal condemnation of the executive by the legislature is often considered a [[vote of no confidence]]. According to supporters of the presidential system, the lack of checks and balances means that misconduct by a prime minister may never be discovered. Writing about [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], [[Woodrow Wyatt]], a former MP in the UK, said \"don't think a Watergate couldn't happen here, you just wouldn't hear about it.\" (ibid)\n\nCritics respond that if a presidential system's legislature is controlled by the president's party, the same situation exists. Proponents{{Who|date=March 2017}} note that even in such a situation a legislator from the president's party is in a better position to criticize the president or his policies should he deem it necessary, since the immediate security of the president's position is less dependent on legislative support. In parliamentary systems, [[party discipline]] is much more strictly enforced. If a parliamentary [[backbencher]] publicly criticizes the executive or its policies to any significant extent then he/she faces a much higher prospect of losing his/her party's nomination, or even outright expulsion from the party. Even mild criticism from a backbencher could carry consequences serious enough (in particular, removal from consideration for a cabinet post) to effectively muzzle a legislator with any serious political ambitions.\n\nDespite the existence of the no confidence vote, in practice it is extremely difficult to stop a prime minister or cabinet that has made its decision. In a parliamentary system, if important legislation proposed by the incumbent prime minister and his cabinet is \"voted down\" by a majority of the members of parliament then it is considered a vote of no confidence. To emphasize that particular point, a prime minister will often declare a particular legislative vote to be a matter of confidence at the first sign of reluctance on the part of legislators from his or her own party. If a government loses a parliamentary vote of confidence, then the incumbent government must then either resign or call elections to be held, a consequence few backbenchers are willing to endure. Hence, a no confidence vote in some parliamentary countries, like Britain, only occurs a few times in a century. In 1931, [[David Lloyd George]] told a select committee: \"Parliament has really no control over the executive; it is a pure fiction.\" (Schlesinger 1982)\n\nBy contrast, if a presidential legislative initiative fails to pass a legislature controlled by the president's party (e.g. the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]] in the United States), it may damage the president's political standing and that of his party, but generally has no immediate effect on whether or not the president completes his term.\n\n=== Speed and decisiveness ===\nSome supporters of presidential systems claim{{Who|date=September 2016}} that presidential systems can respond more rapidly to emerging situations than parliamentary ones. A prime minister, when taking action, needs to retain the support of the legislature, but a president is often less constrained. In ''[[Why England Slept]]'', future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] argued that British prime ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] were constrained by the need to maintain the confidence of the Commons.\n\nOther supporters of presidential systems sometimes argue in the exact opposite direction, however, saying that presidential systems can slow decision-making to beneficial ends. Divided government, where the presidency and the legislature are controlled by different parties, is said to restrain the excesses of both the coalition and opposition, and guarantee cross-partisan input into legislation. In the United States, Republican Congressman [[Bill Frenzel]] wrote in 1995:\n\n{{quote|\"There are some of us who think [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] is the best thing since indoor plumbing. Gridlock is the natural gift the Framers of the Constitution gave us so that the country would not be subjected to policy swings resulting from the whimsy of the public. And the competition\u2014whether multi-branch, multi-level, or multi-house\u2014is important to those checks and balances and to our ongoing kind of centrist government. Thank heaven we do not have a government that nationalizes one year and privatizes next year, and so on ''ad infinitum''\". (Checks and Balances, 8)}}\n\n=== Stability ===\nAlthough most parliamentary governments go long periods of time without a no confidence vote, [[Italy]], [[Israel]], and the [[French Fourth Republic]] have all experienced difficulties maintaining stability. When parliamentary systems have multiple parties, and governments are forced to rely on coalitions, as they often do in nations that use a system of [[proportional representation]], extremist parties can theoretically use the threat of leaving a coalition to further their agendas.\n\nMany people consider presidential systems more able to survive emergencies. A country under enormous stress may, supporters argue, be better off being led by a president with a fixed term than rotating premierships. [[France]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian controversy]] switched to a [[semi-presidential system]] as did [[Sri Lanka]] during its civil war, while [[Israel]] experimented with a directly elected [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]] in 1992. In France and Sri Lanka, the results are widely considered to have been positive. However, in the case of Israel, an unprecedented proliferation of smaller parties occurred, leading to the restoration of the previous system of selecting a prime minister.\n\nThe fact that elections are fixed in a presidential system is considered by supporters a welcome \"check\" on the powers of the executive, contrasting parliamentary systems, which may allow the prime minister to call elections whenever they see fit or orchestrate their own vote of no confidence to trigger an election when they cannot get a legislative item passed. The presidential model is said to discourage this sort of opportunism, and instead forces the executive to operate within the confines of a term they cannot alter to suit their own needs. <!-- Theoretically, if a president's positions and actions have had a positive impact on their respective country, then it is likely that their party's candidate (possibly the sitting president) will be elected for another term in office. [This, of course, also applies in a parliamentary system.] -->\n\nProponents of the presidential system also argue that stability extends to the cabinets chosen under the system, compared to a parliamentary system where cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch.  Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates.  This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based as much or more on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister.  Supporters of the presidential system note that parliamentary systems are prone{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} to disruptive \"[[cabinet shuffle]]s\" where legislators are moved between portfolios, whereas in presidential system cabinets (such as the [[United States Cabinet]]), cabinet shuffles are unusual.\n\n== Criticism and disadvantages ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}\nCritics generally claim three basic disadvantages for presidential systems:\n* '''Tendency towards authoritarianism''' \u2013 some political scientists say presidentialism raises the stakes of elections, exacerbates their polarization and can lead to authoritarianism (Linz).\n* '''Political gridlock''' \u2013 the separation of powers of a presidential system establishes the presidency and the legislature as two parallel structures. Critics argue that this can create an undesirable and long-term [[gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]] whenever the president and the legislative majority are from different parties, which is common because the electorate usually expects more rapid results from new policies than are possible (Linz, Mainwaring and Shugart). In addition, this reduces accountability by allowing the president and the legislature to shift blame to each other.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy, AP* Edition \u2013 2016 Presidential Election, 17th Edition|last=George|first=Edwards|last2=Warrenberg|first2=Martin|publisher=Pearson Higher Education|year=2016|isbn=9780134586571|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n* '''Impediments to leadership change''' \u2013 presidential systems often make it difficult to remove a president from office early, for example after taking actions that become unpopular.\n\nA fourth criticism applies specifically to nations with a proportionally elected legislature and a presidency. Where the voters are virtually all represented by their votes in the proportional outcome, the presidency is elected on a winner-take-all basis. Two different electoral systems are therefore in play, potentially leading to conflicts that are based on the natural differences of the systems.\n\n=== Tendency towards authoritarianism ===\nA prime minister without majority support in the legislature must either form a coalition or, if able to lead a minority government, govern in a manner acceptable to at least some of the opposition parties. Even with a majority government, the prime minister must still govern within (perhaps unwritten) constraints as determined by the members of his party\u2014a premier in this situation is often at greater risk of losing his party leadership than his party is at risk of losing the next election. On the other hand, winning the presidency is a winner-take-all, [[zero-sum game]]. Once elected, a president might be able to marginalize the influence of other parties and exclude rival factions in his own party as well, or even leave the party whose ticket he was elected under. The president can thus rule without any party support until the next election or abuse his power to win multiple terms, a worrisome situation for many interest groups. Yale political scientist [[Juan Linz]] argues that:\n\n{{quote|The danger that zero-sum presidential elections pose is compounded by the rigidity of the president's fixed term in office. Winners and losers are sharply defined for the entire period of the presidential mandate&nbsp;... losers must wait four or five years without any access to executive power and patronage. The zero-sum game in presidential regimes raises the stakes of presidential elections and inevitably exacerbates their attendant tension and polarization.}}\n\nConstitutions that only require [[Plurality voting system|plurality support]] are said{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be especially undesirable, as significant power can be vested in a person who does not enjoy support from a majority of the population.\n\nSome political scientists say that presidential systems are not constitutionally stable and have difficulty sustaining democratic practices, noting that presidentialism has slipped into authoritarianism in many of the countries in which it has been implemented. According to political scientist [[Fred Riggs]], presidentialism has fallen into authoritarianism in nearly every country it has been attempted.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1997|title=Presidentialism versus Parliamentarism: Implications for Representativeness and Legitimacy|jstor=1601343|journal=International Political Science Review |volume= 18| issue =  3|page=258|last1=Riggs|first1=Fred W.|doi=10.1177/019251297018003003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=1994|title=Conceptual homogenization of a heterogeneous field: Presidentialism in comparative perspective|journal=Comparing Nations: Concepts, Strategies, Substance|pages=72\u2013152}}</ref> Political sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] pointed out that this has taken place in political cultures not conducive to democracy and that militaries have tended to play a prominent role in most of these countries. On the other hand, an often-cited{{By whom|date=January 2012}} [[How Democratic Is the American Constitution?#List of countries steadily democratic since at least 1950|list of the world's 22 older democracies]] includes only two countries ([[Costa Rica]] and the [[United States]]) with presidential systems.\n\nIn a presidential system, the legislature and the president have equal mandates from the public. Conflicts between the branches of government might not be reconciled. When president and legislature disagree and government is not working effectively, there is a strong incentive to use extra-constitutional measures to break the deadlock.  Of the [[separation of powers|three common branches]] of government, the executive is in the best position to use extra-constitutional measures, especially when the president is head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the military. By contrast, in a parliamentary system where the often-ceremonial head of state is either a constitutional monarch or (in the case of a parliamentary republic) an experienced and respected figure, given some political emergency there is a good chance that even a ceremonial head of state will be able to use emergency [[reserve powers]] to restrain a head of government acting in an emergency extra-constitutional manner \u2013 this is only possible because the head of state and the head of government are not the same person.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Dana D.

This is common because the electorate often expects more rapid results than are possible from new policies and switches to a different party at the next election.<ref name=\":0\" /> Critics such as [[Juan Linz]], argue that this inherent political instability can cause democracies to fail, as seen in such cases as Brazil and Chile.<ref>Linz, J. (1990). The perils of presidentialism. The journal of democracy, Volume 1(1), pp. 51-69.</ref>\n\n==== Lack of accountability ====\nIn such cases of gridlock, presidential systems are said by critics<ref>Linz, J. (1985). Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference. Connecticut: Yale university press</ref> not to offer voters the kind of accountability seen in parliamentary systems. It is easy for either the president or the legislature to escape blame by shifting it to the other. Describing the United States, former Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]] said \"the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=James|title=Constitutional Reform and Effective Government|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalre00sund_1/page/11 11]}}</ref> Years before becoming President, [[Woodrow Wilson]] (at the time, a fierce critic of the U.S. system of government) famously wrote \"how is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?\"<ref name=PhD_pp186-187>Wilson, ''Congressional Government'' (1885), pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nAn example is the increase in the [[US public debt|federal debt of the United States]] that occurred during the presidency of Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]. Arguably, the deficits were the product of a bargain between President Reagan and the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[Tip O'Neill]]. O'Neill agreed to tax cuts favored by Reagan, and in exchange Reagan agreed to budgets that did not restrain spending to his liking. In such a scenario, each side can say they are displeased with the debt, plausibly blame the other side for the deficit, and still claim success.\n\n=== Impediments to leadership change ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nAnother alleged problem of presidentialism is that it is often difficult to remove a president from office early. Even if a president is \"proved to be inefficient, even if he becomes unpopular, even if his policy is unacceptable to the majority of his countrymen, he and his methods must be endured until the moment comes for a new election\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> [[John Tyler]] was elected vice president and assumed the presidency because [[William Henry Harrison]] died after thirty days in office. Tyler blocked the Whig agenda, was loathed by his nominal party, but remained firmly in control of the executive branch. Most presidential systems provide no legal means to remove a president simply for being unpopular or even for behaving in a manner that might be considered unethical or immoral provided it is not illegal. This has been cited{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} as the reason why many presidential countries have experienced military coups to remove a leader who is said to have lost his mandate.\n\nParliamentary systems can quickly remove unpopular leaders by a [[vote of no confidence]], a procedure that serves as a \"pressure release valve\" for political tension. Votes of no confidence are easier to achieve in [[minority government]] situations, but even if the unpopular leader heads a [[majority government]], he or she is often in a less secure position than a president. Usually in parliamentary systems a basic premise is that if a premier's popularity sustains a serious enough blow and the premier does not as a matter of consequence offer to resign prior to the next election, then those members of parliament who would persist in supporting the premier will be at serious risk of losing their seats. Therefore, especially in parliaments with a strong party system, other prominent members of the premier's party have a strong incentive to initiate a leadership challenge in hopes of mitigating damage to their party. More often than not, a premier facing a serious challenge resolves to save face by [[resignation|resigning]] before being formally removed\u2014[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s relinquishing of her premiership being a prominent example.\n\nOn the other hand, while removing a president through [[impeachment]] is allowed by most constitutions, impeachment proceedings often can be initiated only in cases where the president has violated the constitution or broken the law. Impeachment is often made difficult; by comparison the removal a party leader is normally governed by the (often less formal) rules of the party. Nearly all parties (including governing parties) have a relatively simple process for removing their leaders.\n\nFurthermore, even when impeachment proceedings against a sitting president are successful, whether by causing his removal from office or by compelling his resignation, the legislature usually has little or no discretion in determining the ousted president's successor, since presidential systems usually adhere to a rigid succession process which is enforced the same way regardless of how a vacancy in the presidency comes about. The usual outcome of a presidency becoming vacant is that a vice president automatically succeeds to the presidency. Vice presidents are usually chosen by the president, whether as a running mate who elected alongside the president or appointed by a sitting president, so that when a vice president succeeds to the presidency it is probable that he will continue many or all the policies of the former president. A prominent example of such an accession would be the elevation of Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] to the U.S. Presidency after [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to resign in the face of virtually certain impeachment and removal, a succession that took place notwithstanding the fact that Ford had only assumed the Vice Presidency after being appointed by Nixon to replace [[Spiro Agnew]], who had also resigned due to scandal. In some cases, particularly when the would-be successor to a presidency is seen by legislators as no better (or even worse) than a president they wish to see removed, there may be a strong incentive to abstain from pursuing impeachment proceedings even if there are legal grounds to do so.\n\nSince prime ministers in parliamentary systems must always retain the confidence of the legislature, in cases where a prime minister suddenly leaves office there is little point in anyone without a reasonable prospect of gaining that legislative confidence attempting to assume the premiership. This ensures that whenever a premiership becomes vacant (or is about to become vacant), legislators from the premier's party will always play a key role in determining the leader's permanent successor. In theory this could be interpreted to support an argument that a parliamentary party ought to have the power to elect their party leader directly, and indeed, at least historically, parliamentary system parties' leadership electoral procedures usually called for the party's legislative caucus to fill a leadership vacancy by electing a new leader directly by and from amongst themselves, and for the whole succession process to be completed within as short a time frame as practical. Today, however, such a system is not commonly practiced and most parliamentary system parties' rules provide for a leadership election in which the general membership of the party is permitted to vote at some point in the process (either directly for the new leader or for delegates who then elect the new leader in a convention), though in many cases the party's legislators are allowed to exercise a disproportionate influence in the final vote.\n\nWhenever a leadership election becomes necessary on account of a vacancy arising suddenly, an interim leader (often informally called the ''interim prime minister'' in cases where this involves a governing party) will be selected by the parliamentary party, usually with the stipulation or expectation that the interim leader will not be a candidate for the permanent leadership. Some parties, such as the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], employ some combination of both aforementioned electoral processes to select a new leader. In any event, a prime minister who is forced to leave office due to scandal or similar circumstance will usually have little if any ability to influence his party on the final selection of a new leader and anyone seen to be having close ties to such a prime minister will have limited if any serious prospect of being elected the new leader. Even in cases when an outgoing prime minister is leaving office voluntarily, it is often frowned on for an outgoing or former premier to engage in any overt attempt to influence the election (for example, by endorsing a candidate in the leadership election), in part because a party in the process of selecting a new leader usually has a strong incentive to foster a competitive leadership election in order to stimulate interest and participation in the election, which in turn encourages the sale of party memberships and support for the party in general.\n\n[[Walter Bagehot]] criticized presidentialism because it does not allow a transfer in power in the event of an emergency.\n\n{{quote|Under a cabinet constitution at a sudden emergency the people can choose a ruler for the occasion. It is quite possible and even likely that he would not be ruler before the occasion. The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid energy, the eager nature fit for a great crisis are not required\u2014are impediments\u2014in common times. A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday politics than a Chatham\u2014a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon. By the structure of the world we want, at the sudden occurrence of a grave tempest, to change the helmsman\u2014to replace the pilot of the calm by the pilot of the storm.\n\nBut under a presidential government you can do nothing of the kind. The American government calls itself a government of the supreme people; but at a quick crisis, the time when a sovereign power is most needed, you cannot find the supreme people. You have got a congress elected for one fixed period, going out perhaps by fixed installments, which cannot be accelerated or retarded\u2014you have a president chosen for a fixed period, and immovable during that period:&nbsp;... there is no elastic element&nbsp;... you have bespoken your government in advance, and whether it is what you want or not, by law you must keep it&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Bagehot\">{{cite book|last=Balfour|title=The English Constitution|chapter=The Cabinet}}</ref>}}\n\nOpponents{{who|date=August 2012}} of the presidential system note that years later, Bagehot's observation came to life during World War II, when [[Neville Chamberlain]] was replaced with [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nHowever, supporters of the presidential system question the validity of the point. They argue that if presidents were not able to command some considerable level of security in their tenures, their [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandates]] would be worthless. They further counter that republics such as the United States have successfully endured war and other crises without the need to change heads of state. Supporters argue that presidents elected in a time of peace and prosperity have proven themselves perfectly capable of responding effectively to a serious crisis, largely due to their ability to make the necessary appointments to his cabinet and elsewhere in government or by creating new positions to deal with new challenges. One prominent, recent example would be the appointment of a [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.\n\nSome supporters of the presidential system counter that impediments to a leadership change, being that they are little more than an unavoidable consequence of the [[Presidential system#Direct elections|direct mandate]] afforded to a president, are thus a ''strength'' instead of a weakness in times of crisis.  In such times, a prime minister might hesitate due to the need to keep parliament's support, whereas a president can act without fear of removal from office by those who might disapprove of his actions. Furthermore, even if a prime minister does manage to successfully resolve a crisis (or multiple crises), that does not guarantee and he or she will possess the political capital needed to remain in office for a similar, future crisis. Unlike what would be possible in a presidential system, a perceived crisis in the parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers or rivals an opportunity to launch a vexing challenge for a prime minister's leadership.\n\nFinally, many{{who|date=August 2012}} have criticized presidential systems for their alleged slowness to respond to their citizens' needs. Often, the checks and balances make action difficult. [[Walter Bagehot]] said of the American system, \"the executive is crippled by not getting the law it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by having to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for its name, since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature is demoralized by liberty, by taking decisions of others [and not itself] will suffer the effects\".<ref name=\"Bagehot\" />\n\nDefenders of presidential systems argue that a parliamentary system operating in a jurisdiction with strong ethnic or sectarian tensions will tend to ignore the interests of minorities or even treat them with contempt \u2013 the first half century of government in [[Northern Ireland]] is often cited as an example \u2013 whereas presidential systems ensure that minority wishes and rights cannot be disregarded, thus preventing a \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\" and vice versa protect the wishes and rights of the majority from abuse by a legislature or an executive that holds a contrary viewpoint especially when there are frequent, scheduled elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} On the other hand, supporters of parliamentary systems contend that the strength and independence of the judiciary is the more decisive factor when it comes to protection of minority rights.\n\nBritish-Irish philosopher and MP [[Edmund Burke]] stated that an official should be elected based on \"his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience\", and therefore should reflect on the arguments for and against certain policies before taking positions and then act out on what an official would believe is best in the long run for one's constituents and country as a whole even if it means short-term backlash. Thus defenders of presidential systems hold that sometimes what is [[Trustee model of representation|wisest may not always be the most popular decision]] and vice versa.\n\n== Differences from a parliamentary system ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nA number of key theoretical differences exist between a presidential and a parliamentary system:\n* In a presidential system, the central principle is that the [[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]] and judicial branches of government are separate. This leads to the separate election of president, who is elected to office for a fixed term, and only removable for gross misdemeanor by [[impeachment]] and dismissal. By contrast, in [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], the executive branch is led by a council of ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who are directly accountable to the legislature and often have their background in the legislature (regardless of whether it is called a \"parliament\", an \"assembly\", a \"diet\", or a \"chamber\").\n* As with the president's set term of office, the legislature also exists for a set term of office and cannot be dissolved ahead of schedule. By contrast, in parliamentary systems, the prime minister needs to survive a vote of confidence otherwise a new election must be called. The legislature can typically be dissolved at any stage during its life by the head of state, usually on the advice of either Prime Minister alone, by the Prime Minister and cabinet, or by the cabinet.\n* In a presidential system, the president usually has special privileges in the enactment of legislation, namely the possession of a power of [[veto]] over legislation of bills, in some cases subject to the power of the legislature by weighted majority to override the veto. The legislature and the president are thus expected to serve as [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on each other's powers.\n* Presidential system presidents may also be given a great deal of constitutional authority in the exercise of the office of [[Commander in Chief]], a constitutional title given to most presidents. In addition, the presidential power to receive ambassadors as head of state is usually interpreted as giving the president broad powers to conduct [[foreign policy]]. Though semi-presidential systems may reduce a president's power over day-to-day government affairs, semi-presidential systems commonly give the president power over foreign policy.\n* Parliamentary systems certainly provide greater flexibility in the process of transition to any consolidation of democracy.<ref>Linz, J. (1985) Democracy: Presidential or Parliamentary does it make a difference? Connecticut: Yale university press.</ref>\n\nPresidential systems also have fewer ideological parties than parliamentary systems. Sometimes in the United States, the policies preferred by the two parties have been very similar (but ''see also'' [[polarization (politics)|polarization]]). In the 1950s, during the leadership of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Senate Democrats included the [[right-wing politics|right]]-most members of the chamber\u2014[[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]] and [[Strom Thurmond]], and the [[left-wing politics|left]]-most members\u2014[[Paul Douglas]] and [[Herbert Lehman]]. This pattern does not prevail in Latin American presidential democracies.\n\n=== Overlapping elements ===\nIn practice, elements of both systems overlap. Though a president in a presidential system does not have to choose a government under the legislature, the legislature may have the right to scrutinize his or her appointments to high governmental office, with the right, on some occasions, to block an appointment. In the [[United States]], many appointments must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], although once confirmed an appointee can only be removed against the president's will through [[impeachment]]. By contrast, though answerable ''to'' parliament, a parliamentary system's cabinet may be able to make use of the parliamentary '[[Whip (politics)|whip]]' (an obligation on party members in parliament to vote with their party) to control and dominate parliament, reducing parliament's ability to control the government.\n\n==Republics with a presidential system of government==\n{{main|List of countries by system of government#Presidential systems}}\n\n''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n* {{flag|Angola}}\n* {{flag|Argentina}}\n* {{flag|Benin}}\n* {{flag|Belarus}}\n* {{flag|Bolivia}}\n* {{flag|Brazil}}\n* {{flag|Burundi}}\n* {{flag|Chad}}\n* {{flag|Chile}}\n* {{flag|Colombia}}\n* {{flag|Comoros}}\n* {{flag|Costa Rica}}\n* {{flag|Cyprus}}\n* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}\n* {{flag|Ecuador}}\n* {{flag|El Salvador}}\n* {{flag|Gambia}}\n* {{flag|Ghana}}\n* {{flag|Guatemala}}\n* {{flag|Honduras}}\n* {{flag|Indonesia}}\n* {{flag|Kenya}}\n* {{flag|Liberia}}\n* {{flag|Malawi}}\n* {{flag|Maldives}}\n* {{flag|Mexico}}\n* {{flag|Nicaragua}}\n* {{flag|Nigeria}}\n* {{flag|Palau}}\n* {{flag|Panama}}\n* {{flag|Paraguay}}\n* {{flag|Peru}}\n* {{flag|Philippines}}\n* {{flag|Senegal}}\n* {{flag|Seychelles}}\n* {{flag|Sierra Leone}}\n* {{flag|South Sudan}}\n* {{flag|Turkey}}\n* {{flag|Turkmenistan}}\n* {{flag|United States}}\n* {{flag|Uruguay}}\n* {{flag|Venezuela}}\n* {{flag|Zambia}}\n* {{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Presidential systems with a prime minister===\nThe following countries have presidential systems where a post of [[prime minister]] (official title may vary) exists alongside that of president. Differently from other systems, however, the president is still both the head of state and government and the prime minister's roles are mostly to assist the president.

The stoat first arose in Eurasia, shortly after the [[long-tailed weasel]] arose as its mirror image in North America [[Gelasian|2 million years ago]]. The stoat thrived during the [[Ice Age]], as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows.

The [[whiskers]] are brown or white in colour, and very long. The ears are short, rounded and lie almost flattened against the skull. The claws are not retractable, and are large in proportion to the digits. Each foot has five toes. The male stoat has a curved [[baculum]] with a proximal knob that increases in weight as it ages.<ref name=\"h457\"/> [[Fat]] is deposited primarily along the spine and kidneys, then on gut mesenteries, under the limbs and around the shoulders.

When attacked or being aggressive, the stoat secretes the contents of its anal glands, giving rise to a strong, musky odour produced by several sulphuric compounds. The odour is distinct from that of least weasels.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n===Fur===\n[[File:Mustela erminea winter cropped.jpg|thumb|A stoat in winter fur]]\nThe winter fur is very dense and silky, but quite closely lying and short, while the summer fur is rougher, shorter and sparse.<ref name=\"s997\"/> In summer, the fur is sandy-brown on the back and head and a white below. The division between the dark back and the light belly is usually straight, though this trait is only present in 13.5% of Irish stoats. The stoat moults twice a year. In spring, the moult is slow, starting from the forehead, across the back, toward the belly. In autumn, the moult is quicker, progressing in the reverse direction. The moult, initiated by [[photoperiod]], starts earlier in autumn and later in spring at higher latitudes. In the stoat's northern range, it adopts a completely white coat (save for the black tail-tip) during the winter period.<ref name=\"h457\"/> Differences in the winter and summer coats are less apparent in southern forms of the species.<ref name=\"s998\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=998}}</ref> In the species' southern range, the coat remains brown, but is denser and sometimes paler than in summer.<ref name=\"h457\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:Mustela.erminea.young.jpg|thumb|left|Young stoat]]\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, mating occurs in the April\u2013July period.

[[Lactation]] ends after 12 weeks. Prior to the age of five to seven weeks, kits have poor [[thermoregulation]], so they huddle for warmth when the mother is absent. Males become sexually mature at 10\u201311 months, while females are sexually mature at the age of 2\u20133 weeks whilst still blind, deaf and hairless, and are usually mated with adult males before being [[weaning|weaned]].<ref name=\"h464\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=464\u2013465}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial and sheltering behaviour===\n[[File:StoatDen3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Stoat nesting in a hollow tree.]]\nStoat territoriality has a generally mustelid spacing pattern, with male territories encompassing smaller female territories, which they defend from other males. The size of the territory and the ranging behaviour of its occupants varies seasonally, depending on the abundance of food and mates. During the breeding season, the ranges of females remain unchanged, while males either become roamers, strayers or transients. Dominant older males have territories 50 times larger than those of younger, socially inferior males. Both sexes [[territorial marking|mark their territories]] with [[urine]], [[faeces]] and two types of [[scent mark]]s; anal drags are meant to convey territorial occupancy, and body rubbing is associated with agonistic encounters.<ref name=\"h460\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=460\u2013461}}</ref>\n\nThe stoat does not dig its own burrows, instead using the burrows and nest chambers of the rodents it kills. The skins and underfur of rodent prey are used to line the nest chamber. The nest chamber is sometimes located in seemingly unsuitable places, such as among logs piled against the walls of houses. The stoat also inhabits old and rotting stumps, under tree roots, in heaps of brushwood, haystacks, in bog hummocks, in the cracks of vacant mud buildings, in rock piles, rock clefts, and even in [[magpie]] nests. Males and females typically live apart, but close to each other.<ref name=\"s1021\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1021\u20131022}}</ref> Each stoat has several dens dispersed within its range.

However, unlike the least weasel, which almost exclusively feeds on small [[vole]]s, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and [[lagomorph]] species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as [[European water vole]]s, [[common hamster]]s, [[pika]]s, and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[shrew]]s and, more rarely, [[amphibian]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[insect]]s.<ref name=\"s1018\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1018}}</ref> In Great Britain, [[European rabbit]]s are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s since the end of the [[myxomatosis]] epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, [[rat]]s, [[squirrel]]s and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat's diet. [[Hare]]s are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens.<ref name=\"h463\"/> In North America, where the [[ecological niche]] for rat and rabbit sized prey is taken by the larger long-tailed weasel, the stoat preys on mice, voles, shrews, and young [[cottontail]]s.<ref name=\"v417\">{{Harvnb|Verts|Carraway|1998|p=417}}</ref> In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare [[kiwi]], [[New Zealand kaka|kaka]], [[Yellowhead (bird)|mohua]], [[yellow-crowned parakeet]], and [[New Zealand dotterel]].<ref name=\"h463\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=463}}</ref> Cases are known of stoats preying on young [[muskrat]]s. The stoat typically eats about {{convert|50|g|oz}} of food a day, which is equivalent to 25% of the animal's live weight.<ref name=\"s1020\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stoat killing a rabbit.jpg|thumb|Stoat killing a [[European rabbit]]]]\nThe stoat is an opportunistic predator, which moves rapidly and checks every available burrow or crevice for food. Because of their larger size, male stoats are less successful than females in pursuing rodents far into tunnels. Stoats regularly climb trees to gain access to birds' nests, and are common raiders of nest boxes, particularly those of large species. The stoat reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a \"dance\" (sometimes called the [[weasel war dance]]), though this behaviour could be linked to ''[[Metastrongylidae|Skrjabingylus]]'' infections.<ref name=\"h463\"/> The stoat seeks to immobilize large prey such as rabbits with a bite to the spine at the back of the neck. The stoat may [[surplus killing|surplus kill]] when the opportunity arises, though excess prey is usually cached and eaten later to avoid [[obesity]], as overweight stoats tend to be at a disadvantage when pursuing prey into their burrows.<ref name=\"v417\"/> Small prey typically die instantly from a bite to the back of the neck, while larger prey, such as rabbits, typically die of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], as the stoat's canine teeth are too short to reach the spinal column or major arteries.<ref name=\"h463\"/>\n\n==Communication==\nThe stoat is a usually silent animal, but can produce a range of sounds similar to those of the least weasel. Kits produce a fine chirping noise. Adults trill excitedly before mating, and indicate submission through quiet trilling, whining and squealing. When nervous, the stoat hisses, and will intersperse this with sharp barks or shrieks and prolonged screeching when aggressive.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\nAggressive behaviour in stoats is categorised in these forms:<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n* Noncontact approach, which is sometimes accompanied by a threat display and vocalisation from the approached animal\n* Forward thrust, accompanied by a sharp shriek, which is usually done by stoats defending a nest or retreat site\n* Nest occupation, when a stoat appropriates the nesting site of a weaker individual\n* Kleptoparasitism, in which a dominant stoat appropriates the kill of a weaker one, usually after a fight\n\nSubmissive stoats express their status by avoiding higher-ranking animals, fleeing from them or making whining or squealing sounds.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n==Range and population==\nThe stoat has a [[circumboreal]] range throughout [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], from [[Greenland]] and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands south to about 35\u00b0N. Stoats in North America are found throughout [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]] south through most of the northern [[United States]] to central [[California]], northern [[Arizona]], northern [[New Mexico]], [[Iowa]], the [[Great Lakes]] region, [[New England]], and [[Pennsylvania]], but are absent from most of the [[Great Plains]], and the [[Southeastern United States]]. The stoat in Europe is found as far south as 41\u00baN in [[Portugal]], and inhabits most islands with the exception of [[Iceland]], [[Svalbard]], the [[Mediterranean]] islands and some small [[North Atlantic]] islands. In [[Japan]], it is present in central mountains (northern and central [[Japan Alps]]) to northern part of [[Honshu]] (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido.

The introduction of stoats was opposed by scientists in New Zealand and Britain, including the New Zealand ornithologist [[Walter Buller]]. The warnings were ignored and stoats began to be introduced from Britain in the 1880s, resulting in a noticeable decline in bird populations within six years.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Carolyn |title=Immigrant Killers |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Auckland, NZ |year=1984 |isbn=0-19-558121-0 }}</ref> Stoats are a serious threat to ground- and hole-nesting birds, since the latter have very few means of escaping predation. The highest rates of stoat predation occur after seasonal gluts in southern [[beechmast]] (beechnuts), which encourage the reproduction of rodents on which stoats also feed, encouraging stoats to increase their own numbers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purdey |first1=D.

When it was being chased by hunters, it would supposedly turn around and give itself up to the hunters rather than risk soiling itself.<ref>Sax, Boria (2001) ''The mythical zoo: an encyclopedia of animals in world myth, legend, and literature'', ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|1-57607-612-1}}</ref> The former nation (now province) of [[Brittany]] in France uses a stylized ermine-fur pattern in forming the Coat of Arms and [[Flag of Brittany]].

[[Prelates]] of the Catholic Church still wear ecclesiastical garments featuring ermine (a sign of their status equal to that of the nobility). [[Cecilia Gallerani]] is depicted holding an ermine in her portrait, ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''Emblem 75'', which depicts an ermine being pursued by a hunter and two hounds, is entitled \"Cui candor morte redemptus\" (\"Purity bought with his own death\").

The Soviet Union also contained the highest grades of stoat pelts, with the best grade North American pelts being comparable only to the 9th grade in the quality criteria of former Soviet stoat standards. However, stoat harvesting never became a specialty in any Soviet republic, with most stoats being captured incidentally in traps or near villages. Stoats in the Soviet Union were captured either with dogs or with box-traps or jaw-traps.

The [[whiskers]] are brown or white in colour, and very long. The ears are short, rounded and lie almost flattened against the skull. The claws are not retractable, and are large in proportion to the digits. Each foot has five toes. The male stoat has a curved [[baculum]] with a proximal knob that increases in weight as it ages.<ref name=\"h457\"/> [[Fat]] is deposited primarily along the spine and kidneys, then on gut mesenteries, under the limbs and around the shoulders. The stoat has four pairs of nipples, though they are visible only in females.<ref name=\"h457\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=457}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Weasel (Mustela erminea).jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton]]\nThe dimensions of the stoat are variable, but not as significantly as the least weasel's.<ref name=\"s1002\"/> Unusual among the Carnivora, the size of stoats tends to decrease proportionally with latitude, in contradiction to [[Bergmann's rule]].<ref name=\"k101\"/> [[Sexual dimorphism]] in size is pronounced, with males being roughly 25% larger than females and 1.5-2.0 times their weight.<ref name=\"h459\"/> On average, males measure {{convert|187|\u2013|325|mm|in|abbr=on}} in body length, while females measure {{convert|170|\u2013|270|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

When attacked or being aggressive, the stoat secretes the contents of its anal glands, giving rise to a strong, musky odour produced by several sulphuric compounds. The odour is distinct from that of least weasels.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n===Fur===\n[[File:Mustela erminea winter cropped.jpg|thumb|A stoat in winter fur]]\nThe winter fur is very dense and silky, but quite closely lying and short, while the summer fur is rougher, shorter and sparse.<ref name=\"s997\"/> In summer, the fur is sandy-brown on the back and head and a white below. The division between the dark back and the light belly is usually straight, though this trait is only present in 13.5% of Irish stoats. The stoat moults twice a year. In spring, the moult is slow, starting from the forehead, across the back, toward the belly. In autumn, the moult is quicker, progressing in the reverse direction. The moult, initiated by [[photoperiod]], starts earlier in autumn and later in spring at higher latitudes. In the stoat's northern range, it adopts a completely white coat (save for the black tail-tip) during the winter period.<ref name=\"h457\"/> Differences in the winter and summer coats are less apparent in southern forms of the species.<ref name=\"s998\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=998}}</ref> In the species' southern range, the coat remains brown, but is denser and sometimes paler than in summer.<ref name=\"h457\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:Mustela.erminea.young.jpg|thumb|left|Young stoat]]\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, mating occurs in the April\u2013July period.

The [[milk teeth]] erupt after three weeks, and solid food is eaten after four weeks. The eyes open after five to six weeks, with the black tail-tip appearing a week later. [[Lactation]] ends after 12 weeks. Prior to the age of five to seven weeks, kits have poor [[thermoregulation]], so they huddle for warmth when the mother is absent. Males become sexually mature at 10\u201311 months, while females are sexually mature at the age of 2\u20133 weeks whilst still blind, deaf and hairless, and are usually mated with adult males before being [[weaning|weaned]].<ref name=\"h464\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=464\u2013465}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial and sheltering behaviour===\n[[File:StoatDen3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Stoat nesting in a hollow tree.]]\nStoat territoriality has a generally mustelid spacing pattern, with male territories encompassing smaller female territories, which they defend from other males. The size of the territory and the ranging behaviour of its occupants varies seasonally, depending on the abundance of food and mates. During the breeding season, the ranges of females remain unchanged, while males either become roamers, strayers or transients. Dominant older males have territories 50 times larger than those of younger, socially inferior males. Both sexes [[territorial marking|mark their territories]] with [[urine]], [[faeces]] and two types of [[scent mark]]s; anal drags are meant to convey territorial occupancy, and body rubbing is associated with agonistic encounters.<ref name=\"h460\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=460\u2013461}}</ref>\n\nThe stoat does not dig its own burrows, instead using the burrows and nest chambers of the rodents it kills. The skins and underfur of rodent prey are used to line the nest chamber. The nest chamber is sometimes located in seemingly unsuitable places, such as among logs piled against the walls of houses. The stoat also inhabits old and rotting stumps, under tree roots, in heaps of brushwood, haystacks, in bog hummocks, in the cracks of vacant mud buildings, in rock piles, rock clefts, and even in [[magpie]] nests. Males and females typically live apart, but close to each other.<ref name=\"s1021\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1021\u20131022}}</ref> Each stoat has several dens dispersed within its range. A single den has several galleries, mainly within {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the surface.<ref name=\"h461\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=461}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Stoat and chipmunks.png|left|thumb|Stoat [[surplus killing]] a family of [[chipmunk]]s, as illustrated by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]]]\nAs with the least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost exclusively feeds on small [[vole]]s, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and [[lagomorph]] species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as [[European water vole]]s, [[common hamster]]s, [[pika]]s, and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[shrew]]s and, more rarely, [[amphibian]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[insect]]s.<ref name=\"s1018\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1018}}</ref> In Great Britain, [[European rabbit]]s are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s since the end of the [[myxomatosis]] epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, [[rat]]s, [[squirrel]]s and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat's diet. [[Hare]]s are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens.<ref name=\"h463\"/> In North America, where the [[ecological niche]] for rat and rabbit sized prey is taken by the larger long-tailed weasel, the stoat preys on mice, voles, shrews, and young [[cottontail]]s.<ref name=\"v417\">{{Harvnb|Verts|Carraway|1998|p=417}}</ref> In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare [[kiwi]], [[New Zealand kaka|kaka]], [[Yellowhead (bird)|mohua]], [[yellow-crowned parakeet]], and [[New Zealand dotterel]].<ref name=\"h463\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=463}}</ref> Cases are known of stoats preying on young [[muskrat]]s. The stoat typically eats about {{convert|50|g|oz}} of food a day, which is equivalent to 25% of the animal's live weight.<ref name=\"s1020\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stoat killing a rabbit.jpg|thumb|Stoat killing a [[European rabbit]]]]\nThe stoat is an opportunistic predator, which moves rapidly and checks every available burrow or crevice for food. Because of their larger size, male stoats are less successful than females in pursuing rodents far into tunnels. Stoats regularly climb trees to gain access to birds' nests, and are common raiders of nest boxes, particularly those of large species. The stoat reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a \"dance\" (sometimes called the [[weasel war dance]]), though this behaviour could be linked to ''[[Metastrongylidae|Skrjabingylus]]'' infections.<ref name=\"h463\"/> The stoat seeks to immobilize large prey such as rabbits with a bite to the spine at the back of the neck. The stoat may [[surplus killing|surplus kill]] when the opportunity arises, though excess prey is usually cached and eaten later to avoid [[obesity]], as overweight stoats tend to be at a disadvantage when pursuing prey into their burrows.<ref name=\"v417\"/> Small prey typically die instantly from a bite to the back of the neck, while larger prey, such as rabbits, typically die of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], as the stoat's canine teeth are too short to reach the spinal column or major arteries.<ref name=\"h463\"/>\n\n==Communication==\nThe stoat is a usually silent animal, but can produce a range of sounds similar to those of the least weasel. Kits produce a fine chirping noise. Adults trill excitedly before mating, and indicate submission through quiet trilling, whining and squealing. When nervous, the stoat hisses, and will intersperse this with sharp barks or shrieks and prolonged screeching when aggressive.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\nAggressive behaviour in stoats is categorised in these forms:<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n* Noncontact approach, which is sometimes accompanied by a threat display and vocalisation from the approached animal\n* Forward thrust, accompanied by a sharp shriek, which is usually done by stoats defending a nest or retreat site\n* Nest occupation, when a stoat appropriates the nesting site of a weaker individual\n* Kleptoparasitism, in which a dominant stoat appropriates the kill of a weaker one, usually after a fight\n\nSubmissive stoats express their status by avoiding higher-ranking animals, fleeing from them or making whining or squealing sounds.<ref name=\"h460\"/>\n\n==Range and population==\nThe stoat has a [[circumboreal]] range throughout [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], from [[Greenland]] and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands south to about 35\u00b0N. Stoats in North America are found throughout [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]] south through most of the northern [[United States]] to central [[California]], northern [[Arizona]], northern [[New Mexico]], [[Iowa]], the [[Great Lakes]] region, [[New England]], and [[Pennsylvania]], but are absent from most of the [[Great Plains]], and the [[Southeastern United States]]. The stoat in Europe is found as far south as 41\u00baN in [[Portugal]], and inhabits most islands with the exception of [[Iceland]], [[Svalbard]], the [[Mediterranean]] islands and some small [[North Atlantic]] islands. In [[Japan]], it is present in central mountains (northern and central [[Japan Alps]]) to northern part of [[Honshu]] (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido. Its vertical range is from sea level to 3,000 m.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==Introduction to New Zealand==\n{{main|Stoats in New Zealand}}\nStoats were introduced into [[New Zealand]] during the late 19th century to control rabbits and hares, but are now a major threat to native bird populations. The introduction of stoats was opposed by scientists in New Zealand and Britain, including the New Zealand ornithologist [[Walter Buller]]. The warnings were ignored and stoats began to be introduced from Britain in the 1880s, resulting in a noticeable decline in bird populations within six years.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Carolyn |title=Immigrant Killers |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Auckland, NZ |year=1984 |isbn=0-19-558121-0 }}</ref> Stoats are a serious threat to ground- and hole-nesting birds, since the latter have very few means of escaping predation. The highest rates of stoat predation occur after seasonal gluts in southern [[beechmast]] (beechnuts), which encourage the reproduction of rodents on which stoats also feed, encouraging stoats to increase their own numbers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purdey |first1=D.

Similarly, [[Mary Magdalene]] was depicted as wearing a white stoat pelt as a sign of her reformed character. One popular European legend had it that a white stoat would die before allowing its pure white coat to be besmirched. When it was being chased by hunters, it would supposedly turn around and give itself up to the hunters rather than risk soiling itself.<ref>Sax, Boria (2001) ''The mythical zoo: an encyclopedia of animals in world myth, legend, and literature'', ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|1-57607-612-1}}</ref> The former nation (now province) of [[Brittany]] in France uses a stylized ermine-fur pattern in forming the Coat of Arms and [[Flag of Brittany]].

The fur from the winter coat is referred to as ermine and is the traditional ancient symbol of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] forming the earliest flag of that nation. There is also a design called [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] inspired by the winter coat of the stoat and painted onto other furs, such as rabbit.<ref name=\"lords\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/01/99/lords_reform/235653.stm | title = A house of traditions | date = January 19, 1999 | work=BBC News}}</ref> In Europe these furs are a symbol of royalty and high status; the ceremonial robes of members of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[House of Lords]] and the [[Academic dress of the University of Oxford|academic hoods of the universities of Oxford]] and [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] are traditionally trimmed with ermine<ref name=\"lords\"/> although in practice rabbit or fake fur is now often used instead due to expense or [[animal rights]] concerns. [[Prelates]] of the Catholic Church still wear ecclesiastical garments featuring ermine (a sign of their status equal to that of the nobility). [[Cecilia Gallerani]] is depicted holding an ermine in her portrait, ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''Emblem 75'', which depicts an ermine being pursued by a hunter and two hounds, is entitled \"Cui candor morte redemptus\" (\"Purity bought with his own death\"). Peacham goes on to preach that men and women should follow the example of the ermine and keep their minds and consciences as pure as the legendary ermine keeps its fur.<ref>[http://f01.middlebury.edu/FS010A/STUDENTS/n075.htm The Minerva Britanna Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418124136/http://f01.middlebury.edu/FS010A/students/n075.htm |date=2003-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nErmine were also valued by the [[Tlingit]] and other [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]].

The Soviet Union also contained the highest grades of stoat pelts, with the best grade North American pelts being comparable only to the 9th grade in the quality criteria of former Soviet stoat standards. However, stoat harvesting never became a specialty in any Soviet republic, with most stoats being captured incidentally in traps or near villages. Stoats in the Soviet Union were captured either with dogs or with box-traps or jaw-traps. Guns were rarely used, as they could damage the pelt.<ref name=\"s1029\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1029\u20131030}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ahern|first=Albert|url=https://archive.org/details/furfacts00aherrich|title=Fur Facts|location=St. Louis|publisher=C.
