On April 27, 2005, he announced that his development version of Safari now passed the test, making it the first web browser to do so.<ref name=\"acid2\">{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Hyatt |title=Safari Passes the Acid2 Test |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html |work=Surfin' Safari |publisher=MozillaZine |date=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2005}}</ref>\n\nSafari 2.0 was released on April 29, 2005, as the only web browser included with [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4]]. This version was touted by Apple as possessing a 1.8x speed boost over version 1.2.4, but did not yet include the Acid2 bug fixes. The necessary changes were initially unavailable to [[End-user (computer science)|end-users]] unless they downloaded and compiled the WebKit [[source code]] themselves or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at [[OpenDarwin]].org.<ref name=\"nightly builds\">{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Hyatt |title=Nightly Builds |url=http://webkit.org/blog/29/nightly-builds/ |work=Surfin' Safari |publisher=OpenDarwin.org |date=October 12, 2005 |accessdate=October 29, 2006}}</ref> Apple eventually released version 2.0.2 of Safari, which included the modifications required to pass Acid2, on October 31, 2005.\n\nIn June 2005, after some criticism from KHTML developers over lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development source code and bug tracking of [[WebCore]] and [[JavaScriptCore]] to OpenDarwin.org. WebKit itself was also released as open source. The source code for non-renderer aspects of the browser, such as its [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] elements, remains proprietary.\n\nThe final stable version of Safari 2, Safari 2.0.4, was released on January 10, 2006 for Mac OS X. It was only available as part of Mac OS X Update 10.4.4. This version addressed layout and CPU usage issues, among other improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2343|title=About the Mac OS X 10.4.4 Update (Delta)|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref> Safari 2.0.4 was the last version to be released exclusively on Mac OS X.\n\n=== Safari 3 ===\nOn January 9, 2007, at Macworld SF, Jobs announced the [[iPhone]]. The device's [[operating system]] (later called iPhone OS and subsequently renamed to [[iOS]]) used a mobile version of the Safari browser and was able to display full, desktop-class websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09iphone.html|title=Apple - Press Info - Apple Reinvents the Phone with iPhone|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn June 11, 2007, at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]], Jobs announced Safari 3 for [[Mac OS X v10.5|Mac OS X 10.5]], Windows XP, and Windows Vista. During the announcement, he ran a benchmark based on the iBench browser test suite comparing the most popular Windows browsers,<ref>{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Wilton-Jones |title=Is Safari faster? |url=http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/safaribenchmarks.html |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref> hence claiming that Safari was the fastest browser. Later third-party tests of [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] load times would support Apple's claim that Safari 3 was indeed the fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was found to be only negligibly faster than [[Internet Explorer 7]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] when loading static content from local cache.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michae |last=Czeiszperger |title=Safari 3 Windows Performance Analysis |url=http://www.webperformanceinc.com/library/reports/Safari%20Benchmarks/index.html |publisher=Web Performance |date=October 20, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, had several known bugs<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Maynor |title=Niiiice.. |url=http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2007/06/niiiice.html |publisher=Errata Security |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref> and a [[zero day attack|zero day]] exploit that allowed remote execution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thor |last=Larholm |title=Safari for Windows, 0day exploit in 2 hours |url=http://larholm.com/2007/06/12/safari-for-windows-0day-exploit-in-2-hours/ |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref> The addressed bugs were then corrected by Apple three days later on June 14, 2007, in version 3.0.1 for Windows. On June 22, 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance issues and other security issues. Safari 3.0.2 for Windows handles some fonts that are missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers, such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others.\n\nThe [[iPhone]] was formally released on June 29, 2007. It included a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version, but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device. The version number of Safari as reported in its [[User agent|user agent string]] is 3.0,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.taoofmac.com/space/com/Apple/iPhone/Safari|title=Mobile Safari|author=Rui Carmo|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015|date=June 30, 2007}}</ref> in line with the contemporary desktop versions of Safari.\n\nThe first stable, non-beta release of Safari for Windows, Safari 3.1, was offered as a free download on March 18, 2008.

The final version of Safari 3 is 3.2.3, released on May 12, 2009.\n\n=== Safari 4 ===\nOn June 2, 2008, the WebKit development team announced SquirrelFish,<ref>{{cite web |first=Geoffrey |last=Garen |title=Announcing SquirrelFish |url=http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/ |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref> a new [[JavaScript engine]] that vastly improves Safari's speed at interpreting scripts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vygantas |last=Lipskas |title=Apple Safari 4 |url=http://www.favbrowser.com/apple-safari-4/ |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref> The engine is one of the new features in Safari 4, released to developers on June 11, 2008.

A public beta of Safari 4 was released on February 24, 2009, with new features such as the Top Sites tool (similar to [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]'s [[Features of the Opera web browser#Speed Dial|Speed Dial]] feature), which displays the user's most visited sites on a 3D wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/02/hands-on-safari-4-beta-fast-mixes-polish-rough-ui-edges.ars|title=Hands on: Safari 4 beta fast, mixes polish, rough UI edges|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=September 12, 2015|date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> [[Cover Flow]], a feature of Mac OS X and [[iTunes]], was also implemented in Safari. In the public beta versions, [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]] were placed in the title bar of the window, similar to [[Google Chrome]]. The tab bar was moved back to its original location, below the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] bar, in the final release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theappleblog.com/2009/06/08/apple-releases-safari-4/|title=Apple Releases Safari 4|last=Dempsey|first=James|date=June 9, 2009|work=TheAppleBlog|publisher=The GigaOM Network|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref> The Windows version adopted a native Windows [[Theme (computing)|theme]], rather than the previously employed Mac OS X-style interface. Also Apple removed the blue progress bar located in the address bar (later reinstated in Safari 5). Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on June 17, 2009 and fixed problems with Faces in [[iPhoto]] '09. Safari 4 in [[Mac OS X v10.6]] \"Snow Leopard\" has 64-bit support, which can make [[JavaScript]] loading up to 50% faster. It also has built-in crash resistance unique to Snow Leopard; crash resistance will keep the browser intact if a plug-in like [[Flash player]] crashes, such that the other tabs or windows will be unaffected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/safari.html|title=Apple - Mac OS X - What is Mac OS X - Safari|website=Apple|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521134811/http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/safari.html|archive-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Safari 4.0.4, released on November 11, 2009 for both OS X and Windows, further improves JavaScript performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/DL877|title=Apple - Support - Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSafari was one of the twelve [[BrowserChoice.eu|browsers offered]] to [[European Union|EU]] users of [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2010.

Safari 5.0.1 enabled the Extensions PrefPane by default; previously, users had to enable it via the Debug menu.\n\nApple also released Safari 4.1 concurrently with Safari 5, exclusively for [[Mac OS X Tiger]]. The update included the majority of the features and security enhancements found in Safari 5. It did not, however, include Safari Reader or Safari Extensions.\nTogether with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple released Safari 5.1 for both Windows and Mac on July 20, 2011, with the new function 'Reading List' and a faster browsing experience.

During that time, Microsoft released three major versions of Internet Explorer for Mac that were bundled with Mac OS 8 and [[Mac OS 9]], though Apple continued to include Netscape Navigator as an alternative.

Version 1.0.3, released on August 13, 2004 was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.2, while 1.3.2, released on January 12, 2006 was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.3. However, 10.3 received security updates through 2007.\n\n=== Safari 2 ===\nIn April 2005, [[Dave Hyatt]], one of the Safari developers at Apple, documented his study by fixing specific [[Software bug|bugs]] in Safari, thereby enabling it to pass the [[Acid2]] test developed by the [[Web Standards Project]]. On April 27, 2005, he announced that his development version of Safari now passed the test, making it the first web browser to do so.<ref name=\"acid2\">{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Hyatt |title=Safari Passes the Acid2 Test |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html |work=Surfin' Safari |publisher=MozillaZine |date=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2005}}</ref>\n\nSafari 2.0 was released on April 29, 2005, as the only web browser included with [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4]]. This version was touted by Apple as possessing a 1.8x speed boost over version 1.2.4, but did not yet include the Acid2 bug fixes. The necessary changes were initially unavailable to [[End-user (computer science)|end-users]] unless they downloaded and compiled the WebKit [[source code]] themselves or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at [[OpenDarwin]].org.<ref name=\"nightly builds\">{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Hyatt |title=Nightly Builds |url=http://webkit.org/blog/29/nightly-builds/ |work=Surfin' Safari |publisher=OpenDarwin.org |date=October 12, 2005 |accessdate=October 29, 2006}}</ref> Apple eventually released version 2.0.2 of Safari, which included the modifications required to pass Acid2, on October 31, 2005.\n\nIn June 2005, after some criticism from KHTML developers over lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development source code and bug tracking of [[WebCore]] and [[JavaScriptCore]] to OpenDarwin.org. WebKit itself was also released as open source. The source code for non-renderer aspects of the browser, such as its [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] elements, remains proprietary.\n\nThe final stable version of Safari 2, Safari 2.0.4, was released on January 10, 2006 for Mac OS X. It was only available as part of Mac OS X Update 10.4.4. This version addressed layout and CPU usage issues, among other improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2343|title=About the Mac OS X 10.4.4 Update (Delta)|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref> Safari 2.0.4 was the last version to be released exclusively on Mac OS X.\n\n=== Safari 3 ===\nOn January 9, 2007, at Macworld SF, Jobs announced the [[iPhone]].

Later third-party tests of [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] load times would support Apple's claim that Safari 3 was indeed the fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was found to be only negligibly faster than [[Internet Explorer 7]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] when loading static content from local cache.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michae |last=Czeiszperger |title=Safari 3 Windows Performance Analysis |url=http://www.webperformanceinc.com/library/reports/Safari%20Benchmarks/index.html |publisher=Web Performance |date=October 20, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, had several known bugs<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Maynor |title=Niiiice.. |url=http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2007/06/niiiice.html |publisher=Errata Security |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref> and a [[zero day attack|zero day]] exploit that allowed remote execution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Thor |last=Larholm |title=Safari for Windows, 0day exploit in 2 hours |url=http://larholm.com/2007/06/12/safari-for-windows-0day-exploit-in-2-hours/ |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref> The addressed bugs were then corrected by Apple three days later on June 14, 2007, in version 3.0.1 for Windows. On June 22, 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance issues and other security issues. Safari 3.0.2 for Windows handles some fonts that are missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers, such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others.\n\nThe [[iPhone]] was formally released on June 29, 2007. It included a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version, but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device.

A public beta of Safari 4 was released on February 24, 2009, with new features such as the Top Sites tool (similar to [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]'s [[Features of the Opera web browser#Speed Dial|Speed Dial]] feature), which displays the user's most visited sites on a 3D wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/02/hands-on-safari-4-beta-fast-mixes-polish-rough-ui-edges.ars|title=Hands on: Safari 4 beta fast, mixes polish, rough UI edges|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=September 12, 2015|date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> [[Cover Flow]], a feature of Mac OS X and [[iTunes]], was also implemented in Safari.

Also Apple removed the blue progress bar located in the address bar (later reinstated in Safari 5). Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on June 17, 2009 and fixed problems with Faces in [[iPhoto]] '09. Safari 4 in [[Mac OS X v10.6]] \"Snow Leopard\" has 64-bit support, which can make [[JavaScript]] loading up to 50% faster.
