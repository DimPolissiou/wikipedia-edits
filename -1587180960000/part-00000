The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition.

After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

Stewart and spent his childhood and adolescence in southern California, living mostly in the cities of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Claremont, California|Claremont]]. He graduated in 1957 from [[Pomona Catholic High School]], which at the time was a coeducational school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://damien-hs.edu/history.html|title=Damien High School - Damien History|date=October 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012010019/http://damien-hs.edu/history.html|archive-date=2007-10-12}}</ref> Following graduation from high school, John went on to attend Mt. San Antonio Junior College in Pomona, California, during 1957-1958, when he was active in its music and theater programs.<ref>Cirino, Nancy Ludwig, fellow student</ref>  He demonstrated an early talent for music, learning the guitar and [[banjo]]. He composed his first song, \"Shrunken Head Boogie,\" when he was ten years old. In an interview in Michael Oberman's Music makers column (The Washington, DC Star Newspaper) on 30 October 1971, Stewart said, \"I bought a ukulele when I was in Pasadena. I would listen to [[Sons of the Pioneers]] records. [[Tex Ritter]] really turned me on to music. 'I Love My Rooster' was Top Ten as far as I was concerned.\"\n\n== Musical career ==\nStewart's first venture into popular music was with a high school [[garage band]] known as Johnny Stewart and the Furies. Influenced by the reigning icons of the day, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]], the Furies toured southern California colleges and coffee houses, releasing one single, \"Rockin' Anna,\" which was a minor, regional hit.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Furies and a short time as a member of the Woodsmen, Stewart teamed up with [[Gil Robbins]] (father of actor [[Tim Robbins]]) and John Montgomery to form the Cumberland Three, a group patterned after, and heavily influenced by, the increasingly popular Kingston Trio. The major accomplishment of the Cumberland Three was a two-LP set of ''[[Songs from the Civil War]]'', with the albums containing a compilation of songs from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], respectively. In all, the Cumberland Three released three albums, after which Stewart left the group to join the Kingston Trio, replacing Trio founder [[Dave Guard]] in 1961.\n\n=== Kingston Trio years ===\nThe [[Kingston Trio]] had emerged from the relatively crowded San Francisco [[folk music]] culture in 1957, using a mixture of [[Calypso music|calypso]], pop, and folk styles, along with several forms of comedy, in their act. Relying on new pop-oriented arrangements of folk music classics as well as some original compositions, the Trio earned their first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] with \"[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]\" and thereby launched a major revival in folk music that would lead to and influence the careers of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Peter, Paul, & Mary]], and [[John Denver]], among others. The group had become one of the best-known and best-selling acts on the folk music scene and were enjoying a lucrative recording and touring contract with [[Capitol Records]], having ten albums under their collective belts, when Dave Guard departed the group in 1961 to explore other musical directions. Stewart was selected by the remaining members [[Nick Reynolds]] and [[Bob Shane]] as Guard's successor, bringing with him his respected skills as a musician, composer, and performer.\n\nReynolds, Shane, and Stewart would record a dozen albums together, taking the music of the Trio into new directions, including more original material, and performing covers of songs by relative newcomers [[Tom Paxton]], [[Mason Williams]] and [[Gordon Lightfoot]].\n\nThe pop-folk era began to wane as the music of groups such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and fellow Californians [[the Beach Boys]] increasingly dominated the charts, and in 1967 the members of the Kingston Trio decided to disband.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1138/9|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n\n=== Solo career, the post-Trio years ===\nStewart continued to write songs and record for Capitol, while touring as a solo act. It was during this time that he composed the hit \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" for [[the Monkees]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which was a hit for [[Anne Murray]] as well, and the closest Stewart came to writing a \"[[Standard (music)|standard]]\". He later toured with [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign and met and married in 1975 fellow folk singer [[Buffy Ford Stewart|Buffy Ford]]<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (with whom he remained until his death).  He recorded a string of albums, including his signature album, ''[[California Bloodlines]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as well as ''[[Willard (album)|Willard]]'', ''[[Cannons in the Rain]]'', and ''[[Wingless Angels]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://waddywachtelinfo.com/JohnStewart.html|title=John Stewart - Wingless Angels 1975|website=Waddywachtelinfo.com}}</ref>\n\nThough usually successful with critics and a core group of fans, Stewart's albums were not considered commercial successes; he left Capitol after only two solo releases and was signed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], where he also recorded just two albums before moving on to [[RCA Records]], with whom he released three LPs (including a live performance album, ''[[The Phoenix Concerts]]''). Stewart followed his release from RCA with a contract at the [[Robert Stigwood]] organization, the same organization that serviced the recording contracts for Eric Clapton, the [[Bee Gees]], as well as several other [[disco]] performers. It was at [[RSO Records]] that Stewart enjoyed his most commercially successful years as a solo artist. Teaming with [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Lindsey Buckingham]] (then in [[Fleetwood Mac]]), Stewart recorded and released ''[[Bombs Away Dream Babies]]'', which made it to #10 on ''Billboard'''s album chart and included the #5 hit, \"[[Gold (John Stewart song)|Gold]],\" in 1979.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (Perhaps fittingly, considering the song's cynical attitude, Stewart would later stop performing \"Gold\" in concert, calling it \"vapid\" and \"empty\". The artist further claimed the tune meant nothing to him, having done it for the money and to please his record company.)<ref>interview from John Stewart Memorial concert, which took place May 3, 2008 at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California</ref>\n\nTwo other tracks from ''Bombs Away'', \"Midnight Wind\" and \"Lost Her in the Sun\", would also hit the [[Top 40]], making Stewart a sudden pop star at the age of 40. However, the follow-up album, ''[[Dream Babies Go Hollywood]]'' (1980), proved to be a commercial disappointment, hitting only #85 on the album chart.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> None of the singles from that LP (or any of his subsequent albums) made the [[Billboard Hot 100]], though Stewart continued to perform right up to the time of his death.\n\n=== Later years ===\nStewart's later and most significant success was as a songwriter. Several of his songs were recorded by a number of popular acts, including [[Nanci Griffith]] (\"Sweet Dreams Will Come\"), [[Rosanne Cash]] (\"Runaway Train\", \"Dance with the Tiger\"), [[Joan Baez]] (\"Strange Rivers\"). He also continued to record new material, producing CDs on his own \"Neon Dreams\" label in between commercial releases. They usually coincided with one of his tours. His last album was ''[[The Day the River Sang (album)|The Day the River Sang]]'' in 2006.\n\nOver his last years, Stewart teamed up with former Kingston Trio member Nick Reynolds to offer fans the ultimate Trio Fantasy: performing for and with Stewart and Reynolds. In 2005 and 2006 [[Bob Shane]] attended and performed a few songs with Stewart and Reynolds at the Trio ''Fantasy Camp'', which is held annually in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nA tape of Stewart's 1969 song \"Mother Country\" from ''California Bloodlines'' was played on the [[Apollo 11]] [[spacecraft]] during its return to Earth. The production team of CNN's 2019 film \"[[Apollo 11 (2019 film)|Apollo 11]]\" heard the song while listening to archival footage of the flight and included a blend of the astronaut's tape  with the original studio recording of the tune in the soundtrack as the craft approached the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIn 2001, Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[World Folk Music Association]].<ref name=\"noble\">{{Cite book|title=Number #1 : the story of the original Highwaymen|last=Noble|first=Richard E.|publisher=Outskirts Press|year=2009|isbn=9781432738099|location=Denver|pages=265\u2013267|oclc=426388468}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nStewart had a passion for painting, doing art shows and covers for his recordings and books. He continued to be a prolific songwriter and toured the United States and Europe regularly. He resided in [[Marin County]], California with his wife, [[Buffy Ford Stewart]]. Stewart's brother [[Michael Stewart (musician)|Mike]], who died in 2002, founded the folk-rock group [[We Five]] in the mid 1960s. He was the uncle of Jamie Stewart of the band [[Xiu Xiu]].\n\n== Death ==\nIn 2007, Stewart was diagnosed with the early stages of [[Alzheimer's Disease]], but resolved to continue performing as long as he was able.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westallen.typepad.com/idealawg/2008/01/rip-john-stewar.html|title=R.I.P.: John Stewart of The Kingston Trio (1939 - 2008)|publisher=westallen.typepad.com|accessdate=2016-01-26}}</ref> On January 19, 2008, he died from a [[stroke]] at a San Diego hospital, ten days before a scheduled performance in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Stewart and spent his childhood and adolescence in southern California, living mostly in the cities of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Claremont, California|Claremont]]. He graduated in 1957 from [[Pomona Catholic High School]], which at the time was a coeducational school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://damien-hs.edu/history.html|title=Damien High School - Damien History|date=October 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012010019/http://damien-hs.edu/history.html|archive-date=2007-10-12}}</ref> Following graduation from high school, John went on to attend Mt. San Antonio Junior College in Pomona, California, during 1957-1958, when he was active in its music and theater programs.<ref>Cirino, Nancy Ludwig, fellow student</ref>  He demonstrated an early talent for music, learning the guitar and [[banjo]]. He composed his first song, \"Shrunken Head Boogie,\" when he was ten years old. In an interview in Michael Oberman's Music makers column (The Washington, DC Star Newspaper) on 30 October 1971, Stewart said, \"I bought a ukulele when I was in Pasadena. I would listen to [[Sons of the Pioneers]] records. [[Tex Ritter]] really turned me on to music. 'I Love My Rooster' was Top Ten as far as I was concerned.\"\n\n== Musical career ==\nStewart's first venture into popular music was with a high school [[garage band]] known as Johnny Stewart and the Furies. Influenced by the reigning icons of the day, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]], the Furies toured southern California colleges and coffee houses, releasing one single, \"Rockin' Anna,\" which was a minor, regional hit.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Furies and a short time as a member of the Woodsmen, Stewart teamed up with [[Gil Robbins]] (father of actor [[Tim Robbins]]) and John Montgomery to form the Cumberland Three, a group patterned after, and heavily influenced by, the increasingly popular Kingston Trio. The major accomplishment of the Cumberland Three was a two-LP set of ''[[Songs from the Civil War]]'', with the albums containing a compilation of songs from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], respectively. In all, the Cumberland Three released three albums, after which Stewart left the group to join the Kingston Trio, replacing Trio founder [[Dave Guard]] in 1961.\n\n=== Kingston Trio years ===\nThe [[Kingston Trio]] had emerged from the relatively crowded San Francisco [[folk music]] culture in 1957, using a mixture of [[Calypso music|calypso]], pop, and folk styles, along with several forms of comedy, in their act. Relying on new pop-oriented arrangements of folk music classics as well as some original compositions, the Trio earned their first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] with \"[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]\" and thereby launched a major revival in folk music that would lead to and influence the careers of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Peter, Paul, & Mary]], and [[John Denver]], among others. The group had become one of the best-known and best-selling acts on the folk music scene and were enjoying a lucrative recording and touring contract with [[Capitol Records]], having ten albums under their collective belts, when Dave Guard departed the group in 1961 to explore other musical directions. Stewart was selected by the remaining members [[Nick Reynolds]] and [[Bob Shane]] as Guard's successor, bringing with him his respected skills as a musician, composer, and performer.\n\nReynolds, Shane, and Stewart would record a dozen albums together, taking the music of the Trio into new directions, including more original material, and performing covers of songs by relative newcomers [[Tom Paxton]], [[Mason Williams]] and [[Gordon Lightfoot]].\n\nThe pop-folk era began to wane as the music of groups such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and fellow Californians [[the Beach Boys]] increasingly dominated the charts, and in 1967 the members of the Kingston Trio decided to disband.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1138/9|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n\n=== Solo career, the post-Trio years ===\nStewart continued to write songs and record for Capitol, while touring as a solo act. It was during this time that he composed the hit \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" for [[the Monkees]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which was a hit for [[Anne Murray]] as well, and the closest Stewart came to writing a \"[[Standard (music)|standard]]\". He later toured with [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign and met and married in 1975 fellow folk singer [[Buffy Ford Stewart|Buffy Ford]]<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (with whom he remained until his death).  He recorded a string of albums, including his signature album, ''[[California Bloodlines]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as well as ''[[Willard (album)|Willard]]'', ''[[Cannons in the Rain]]'', and ''[[Wingless Angels]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://waddywachtelinfo.com/JohnStewart.html|title=John Stewart - Wingless Angels 1975|website=Waddywachtelinfo.com}}</ref>\n\nThough usually successful with critics and a core group of fans, Stewart's albums were not considered commercial successes; he left Capitol after only two solo releases and was signed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], where he also recorded just two albums before moving on to [[RCA Records]], with whom he released three LPs (including a live performance album, ''[[The Phoenix Concerts]]''). Stewart followed his release from RCA with a contract at the [[Robert Stigwood]] organization, the same organization that serviced the recording contracts for Eric Clapton, the [[Bee Gees]], as well as several other [[disco]] performers. It was at [[RSO Records]] that Stewart enjoyed his most commercially successful years as a solo artist. Teaming with [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Lindsey Buckingham]] (then in [[Fleetwood Mac]]), Stewart recorded and released ''[[Bombs Away Dream Babies]]'', which made it to #10 on ''Billboard'''s album chart and included the #5 hit, \"[[Gold (John Stewart song)|Gold]],\" in 1979.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (Perhaps fittingly, considering the song's cynical attitude, Stewart would later stop performing \"Gold\" in concert, calling it \"vapid\" and \"empty\". The artist further claimed the tune meant nothing to him, having done it for the money and to please his record company.)<ref>interview from John Stewart Memorial concert, which took place May 3, 2008 at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California</ref>\n\nTwo other tracks from ''Bombs Away'', \"Midnight Wind\" and \"Lost Her in the Sun\", would also hit the [[Top 40]], making Stewart a sudden pop star at the age of 40. However, the follow-up album, ''[[Dream Babies Go Hollywood]]'' (1980), proved to be a commercial disappointment, hitting only #85 on the album chart.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> None of the singles from that LP (or any of his subsequent albums) made the [[Billboard Hot 100]], though Stewart continued to perform right up to the time of his death.\n\n=== Later years ===\nStewart's later and most significant success was as a songwriter. Several of his songs were recorded by a number of popular acts, including [[Nanci Griffith]] (\"Sweet Dreams Will Come\"), [[Rosanne Cash]] (\"Runaway Train\", \"Dance with the Tiger\"), [[Joan Baez]] (\"Strange Rivers\"). He also continued to record new material, producing CDs on his own \"Neon Dreams\" label in between commercial releases. They usually coincided with one of his tours. His last album was ''[[The Day the River Sang (album)|The Day the River Sang]]'' in 2006.\n\nOver his last years, Stewart teamed up with former Kingston Trio member Nick Reynolds to offer fans the ultimate Trio Fantasy: performing for and with Stewart and Reynolds. In 2005 and 2006 [[Bob Shane]] attended and performed a few songs with Stewart and Reynolds at the Trio ''Fantasy Camp'', which is held annually in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nA tape of Stewart's 1969 song \"Mother Country\" from ''California Bloodlines'' was played on the [[Apollo 11]] [[spacecraft]] during its return to Earth. The production team of CNN's 2019 film \"[[Apollo 11 (2019 film)|Apollo 11]]\" heard the song while listening to archival footage of the flight and included a blend of the astronaut's tape  with the original studio recording of the tune in the soundtrack as the craft approached the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIn 2001, Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[World Folk Music Association]].<ref name=\"noble\">{{Cite book|title=Number #1 : the story of the original Highwaymen|last=Noble|first=Richard E.|publisher=Outskirts Press|year=2009|isbn=9781432738099|location=Denver|pages=265\u2013267|oclc=426388468}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nStewart had a passion for painting, doing art shows and covers for his recordings and books. He continued to be a prolific songwriter and toured the United States and Europe regularly. He resided in [[Marin County]], California with his wife, [[Buffy Ford Stewart]]. Stewart's brother [[Michael Stewart (musician)|Mike]], who died in 2002, founded the folk-rock group [[We Five]] in the mid 1960s. He was the uncle of Jamie Stewart of the band [[Xiu Xiu]].\n\n== Death ==\nIn 2007, Stewart was diagnosed with the early stages of [[Alzheimer's Disease]], but resolved to continue performing as long as he was able.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westallen.typepad.com/idealawg/2008/01/rip-john-stewar.html|title=R.I.P.: John Stewart of The Kingston Trio (1939 - 2008)|publisher=westallen.typepad.com|accessdate=2016-01-26}}</ref> On January 19, 2008, he died from a [[stroke]] at a San Diego hospital, ten days before a scheduled performance in Scottsdale, Arizona.
