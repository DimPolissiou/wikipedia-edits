The day was also meant to celebrate individual [[health care provider|health workers]] \u2013 the people who provide health care to those who need it, in other words those at the heart of [[health system]]s.\n\nThe Day also marked the launch of the WHO's ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2006]]'', which focused on the same theme. The report contained an assessment of the current crisis in the global health workforce, revealing an estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and other [[health care provider]]s worldwide, and further proposed a series of actions for countries and the international community to tackle it.<ref>''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 World Health Organization, 2006]</ref>\n\n# The World Health\n\n===2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change===\nIn 2008, World Health Day focused on the need to protect health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]] and establish links between climate change and health and other development areas such as environment, food, energy, transport.\n\nThe theme \"protecting health from climate change\" put health at the centre of the global dialogue about climate change. WHO selected this theme in recognition that climate change is posing ever growing threats to global public health security.<ref>World Health Organization:[http://www.who.int/world-health-day/previous/2008/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2008'']</ref>\n\n===2009: Save lives. Make hospitals safe in emergencies===\n[[File:Hartford Hospital main entrance.JPG|thumb|Hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of [[health care provider|health facilities]] and the readiness of health workers who treat those affected by emergencies. Health centres and staff are critical lifelines for vulnerable people in disasters \u2013 treating [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]], preventing illnesses and caring for people's health needs. Often, already fragile health systems are unable to keep functioning through a disaster, with immediate and future public health consequences.\n\nFor this year's World Health Day campaign, WHO and international partners underscored the importance of investing in health infrastructure that can withstand hazards and serve people in immediate need, and urged health facilities to implement systems to respond to internal emergencies, such as fires, and ensure the continuity of care.\n\n===2010: Urbanization and health===\nWith the campaign \"1000 cities, 1000 lives\", events were organized worldwide during the week starting 7 April 2010. The global goals of the campaign were:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2010/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2010'']</ref>\n* ''1000 cities'': to open up public spaces to health, whether it be activities in parks, town hall meetings, clean-up campaigns, or closing off portions of streets to motorized vehicles.\n* ''1000 lives'': to collect 1000 stories of urban health champions who have taken action and had a significant impact on health in their cities.\n\n===2011: Antimicrobial Resistance===\nThe theme of World Health Day 2011, marked on 7 April 2011, was \"[[Antimicrobial resistance]] and its global spread\" and focused on the need for governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to prevent and counter the emergence of highly resistant [[microorganism]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4616&Itemid=3611&lang=en|title=World Health Day 2011 {{!}} PAHO WHO|last=Mitchell|first=Cristina|work=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[infection]]s caused by resistant microorganisms fail to respond to standard treatments, including [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] and other [[anti-microbial|antimicrobial]] medicines \u2013 also known as [[Multiple drug resistance|drug resistance]] \u2013 this may result in prolonged illness and greater risk of death.\n\nOn World Health Day 2011, WHO called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antimicrobial medicines for future generations. The organization introduced a six-point policy package to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance:<ref>World Health Organization. ''World Health Day 2011: policy briefs''.

Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more and more people live longer and enter an age when they may need [[health care]]. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Countries and health care systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As stated by John Beard, director of the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course, \"With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for [[long-term care]] becomes more and more urgent.\"<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf \"Defusing the demographic \u201ctime-bomb\u201d in Germany.\"] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6\u20137.</ref>\n\nDifferent activities were organized by WHO as well as non-governmental and community organizations around the world to mark World Health Day 2012.<ref>World Health Organization.

The organization estimates one in 3 adults has raised blood pressure.\n\nSpecific objectives of the World Health Day 2013 campaign were to:\n* raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure;\n* provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure and related complications;\n* encourage adults to check their [[blood pressure]] and follow the advice of healthcare professionals;\n* encourage [[self care]] to prevent high blood pressure;\n* to make blood pressure measurement affordable to all;\n* to incite national and local authorities to create enabling environments for [[Health promotion|healthy behaviours]].\n\n===2014: Small bite, Big threat===\n[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' yellow fever mosquito feeding]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2014 put the spotlight on some of the most commonly known [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] \u2013 such as mosquitoes, sandflies, bugs, ticks and snails \u2013 responsible for transmitting a wide range of parasites and pathogens that can cause many different illnesses. Mosquitoes, for example, transmit [[malaria]] \u2013 the most deadly vector-borne disease, causing an estimated 660 000 deaths annually worldwide \u2013 as well as [[dengue fever]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[chikungunya]], [[Japanese encephalitis]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2014/event/en/index.html World Health Organization, \"World Health Day \u2013 17 April 2014.\"]</ref> More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.\n\nThe goal of the World Health Day 2014 campaign was better protection from vector-borne diseases, especially for families living in areas where diseases are transmitted by vectors, and travelers to countries where they pose a health threat. The campaign advocated for health authorities in countries where vector-borne diseases are a [[public health]] problem or emerging threat, to put in place measures to improve surveillance and protection.\n\n===2015: Food Safety===\nThe WHO promoted improvement of [[food safety]] as part of the 2015 World Health Day campaign.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event/en/ World Health Day 2015: Food safety.] Geneva.

Changes in [[food production]], [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[food consumption|consumption]]; changes to the environment; new and emerging pathogens; and [[antimicrobial resistance]] all pose challenges to food safety systems.\n\nThe WHO works with countries and partners to strengthen efforts to prevent, detect and respond to [[foodborne disease]] outbreaks in line with the [[Codex Alimentarius]], advocating that food safety is a shared responsibility \u2014 from farmers and manufacturers to vendors and consumers \u2014 and  raising awareness about the importance of the part everyone can play in ensuring that the food on our plate is safe to eat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Ritu|title=World Health Day 2015: Make food safety a shared responsibility|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/world-health-day-2015-make-food-safety-a-shared-responsibility_1574214.html|website=Zee News|publisher=Zee_News|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016: Diabetes===\n[[File:Diabetes world map - 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rates of diabetes worldwide (per 1,000 inhabitants) \u2014 world average was 2.8%.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|\u2264&nbsp;7.5}}\n{{legend|#fff200|7.5\u201315}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|15\u201322.5}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|22.5\u201330}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|30\u201337.5}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|37.5\u201345}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|45\u201352.5}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|52.5\u201360}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|60\u201367.5}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|67.5\u201375}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|75\u201382.5}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|\u2265&nbsp;82.5}}\n{{col-end}} ]]\n\nThe WHO focused World Health Day 2016, on [[diabetes]] \u2013 a largely preventable and treatable [[non-communicable disease]] that is rapidly increasing in numbers in many countries, most dramatically in [[developing country|low- and middle-income countries]].

The day was also meant to celebrate individual [[health care provider|health workers]] \u2013 the people who provide health care to those who need it, in other words those at the heart of [[health system]]s.\n\nThe Day also marked the launch of the WHO's ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2006]]'', which focused on the same theme. The report contained an assessment of the current crisis in the global health workforce, revealing an estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and other [[health care provider]]s worldwide, and further proposed a series of actions for countries and the international community to tackle it.<ref>''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 World Health Organization, 2006]</ref>\n\n# The World Health\n\n===2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change===\nIn 2008, World Health Day focused on the need to protect health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]] and establish links between climate change and health and other development areas such as environment, food, energy, transport.\n\nThe theme \"protecting health from climate change\" put health at the centre of the global dialogue about climate change. WHO selected this theme in recognition that climate change is posing ever growing threats to global public health security.<ref>World Health Organization:[http://www.who.int/world-health-day/previous/2008/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2008'']</ref>\n\n===2009: Save lives. Make hospitals safe in emergencies===\n[[File:Hartford Hospital main entrance.JPG|thumb|Hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of [[health care provider|health facilities]] and the readiness of health workers who treat those affected by emergencies. Health centres and staff are critical lifelines for vulnerable people in disasters \u2013 treating [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]], preventing illnesses and caring for people's health needs. Often, already fragile health systems are unable to keep functioning through a disaster, with immediate and future public health consequences.\n\nFor this year's World Health Day campaign, WHO and international partners underscored the importance of investing in health infrastructure that can withstand hazards and serve people in immediate need, and urged health facilities to implement systems to respond to internal emergencies, such as fires, and ensure the continuity of care.\n\n===2010: Urbanization and health===\nWith the campaign \"1000 cities, 1000 lives\", events were organized worldwide during the week starting 7 April 2010. The global goals of the campaign were:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2010/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2010'']</ref>\n* ''1000 cities'': to open up public spaces to health, whether it be activities in parks, town hall meetings, clean-up campaigns, or closing off portions of streets to motorized vehicles.\n* ''1000 lives'': to collect 1000 stories of urban health champions who have taken action and had a significant impact on health in their cities.\n\n===2011: Antimicrobial Resistance===\nThe theme of World Health Day 2011, marked on 7 April 2011, was \"[[Antimicrobial resistance]] and its global spread\" and focused on the need for governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to prevent and counter the emergence of highly resistant [[microorganism]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4616&Itemid=3611&lang=en|title=World Health Day 2011 {{!}} PAHO WHO|last=Mitchell|first=Cristina|work=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[infection]]s caused by resistant microorganisms fail to respond to standard treatments, including [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] and other [[anti-microbial|antimicrobial]] medicines \u2013 also known as [[Multiple drug resistance|drug resistance]] \u2013 this may result in prolonged illness and greater risk of death.\n\nOn World Health Day 2011, WHO called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antimicrobial medicines for future generations. The organization introduced a six-point policy package to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance:<ref>World Health Organization. ''World Health Day 2011: policy briefs''.

Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more and more people live longer and enter an age when they may need [[health care]]. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Countries and health care systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As stated by John Beard, director of the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course, \"With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for [[long-term care]] becomes more and more urgent.\"<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf \"Defusing the demographic \u201ctime-bomb\u201d in Germany.\"] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6\u20137.</ref>\n\nDifferent activities were organized by WHO as well as non-governmental and community organizations around the world to mark World Health Day 2012.<ref>World Health Organization.

The organization estimates one in 3 adults has raised blood pressure.\n\nSpecific objectives of the World Health Day 2013 campaign were to:\n* raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure;\n* provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure and related complications;\n* encourage adults to check their [[blood pressure]] and follow the advice of healthcare professionals;\n* encourage [[self care]] to prevent high blood pressure;\n* to make blood pressure measurement affordable to all;\n* to incite national and local authorities to create enabling environments for [[Health promotion|healthy behaviours]].\n\n===2014: Small bite, Big threat===\n[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' yellow fever mosquito feeding]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2014 put the spotlight on some of the most commonly known [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] \u2013 such as mosquitoes, sandflies, bugs, ticks and snails \u2013 responsible for transmitting a wide range of parasites and pathogens that can cause many different illnesses. Mosquitoes, for example, transmit [[malaria]] \u2013 the most deadly vector-borne disease, causing an estimated 660 000 deaths annually worldwide \u2013 as well as [[dengue fever]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[chikungunya]], [[Japanese encephalitis]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2014/event/en/index.html World Health Organization, \"World Health Day \u2013 17 April 2014.\"]</ref> More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.\n\nThe goal of the World Health Day 2014 campaign was better protection from vector-borne diseases, especially for families living in areas where diseases are transmitted by vectors, and travelers to countries where they pose a health threat. The campaign advocated for health authorities in countries where vector-borne diseases are a [[public health]] problem or emerging threat, to put in place measures to improve surveillance and protection.\n\n===2015: Food Safety===\nThe WHO promoted improvement of [[food safety]] as part of the 2015 World Health Day campaign.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event/en/ World Health Day 2015: Food safety.] Geneva. Accessed 25 November 2014.</ref> Unsafe food \u2014 food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances \u2014 is responsible for more than 200 diseases, and is linked to the deaths of some 2 million people annually, mostly children. Changes in [[food production]], [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[food consumption|consumption]]; changes to the environment; new and emerging pathogens; and [[antimicrobial resistance]] all pose challenges to food safety systems.\n\nThe WHO works with countries and partners to strengthen efforts to prevent, detect and respond to [[foodborne disease]] outbreaks in line with the [[Codex Alimentarius]], advocating that food safety is a shared responsibility \u2014 from farmers and manufacturers to vendors and consumers \u2014 and  raising awareness about the importance of the part everyone can play in ensuring that the food on our plate is safe to eat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Ritu|title=World Health Day 2015: Make food safety a shared responsibility|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/world-health-day-2015-make-food-safety-a-shared-responsibility_1574214.html|website=Zee News|publisher=Zee_News|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016: Diabetes===\n[[File:Diabetes world map - 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rates of diabetes worldwide (per 1,000 inhabitants) \u2014 world average was 2.8%.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|\u2264&nbsp;7.5}}\n{{legend|#fff200|7.5\u201315}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|15\u201322.5}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|22.5\u201330}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|30\u201337.5}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|37.5\u201345}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|45\u201352.5}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|52.5\u201360}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|60\u201367.5}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|67.5\u201375}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|75\u201382.5}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|\u2265&nbsp;82.5}}\n{{col-end}} ]]\n\nThe WHO focused World Health Day 2016, on [[diabetes]] \u2013 a largely preventable and treatable [[non-communicable disease]] that is rapidly increasing in numbers in many countries, most dramatically in [[developing country|low- and middle-income countries]].

[[Eugene Kaspersky]], founder of [[Kaspersky Lab]], concludes that \"[[cyberterrorism]]\" is a more accurate term than \"cyberwar\". He states that \"with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism.\"<ref name=\"Kaspersky1\">[http://www.timesofisrael.com/experts-we-lost-the-cyber-war-now-were-in-the-era-of-cyber-terror/ \"Latest viruses could mean 'end of world as we know it,' says man who discovered Flame\"], ''The Times of Israel'', 6 June 2012</ref> [[Howard Schmidt]], former Cyber Security Coordinator of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]], said that \"there is no cyberwar...

The term war inherently refers to a large scale action, typically over a protracted period of time and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the aim to kill.<ref name=\":0\" /> A cyber war could accurately describe a protracted period of back-and-forth cyber attacks (including in combination with traditional military action) between nations. To date, no such action is known to have occurred. Instead, [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] military-cyber actions are more commonplace.

Compromise of military systems, such as [[C4ISTAR]] components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.<ref name=Clark2>[http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/top/2010/09/24-11/Clarke-More-defense-needed-in-cyberspace.html \"Clarke: More defense needed in cyberspace\"] HometownAnnapolis.com, 24 September 2010</ref>\n \nIn mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called [[Stuxnet]] that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered \"the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies,\" notes ''The New York Times''.<ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/malware-hits-computerized-industrial-equipment/ \"Malware Hits Computerized Industrial Equipment\"]. ''The New York Times'', 24 September 2010</ref>\n \n[[Stuxnet]], while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost. For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive. The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective. Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences. Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies. A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation. This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage. In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=P.W. |last2=Friedman |first2=Allan |date=2014 |title=Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=156 |isbn=978-0-19-991809-6}}</ref>\n \n==== Denial-of-service attack ====\n{{Main|Denial-of-service attack}}\nIn computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating.

Therefore, in order to be prepared from future attacks, South Korea and the United States will discuss further about deterrence plans at the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM).

Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication.

[[Eugene Kaspersky]], founder of [[Kaspersky Lab]], concludes that \"[[cyberterrorism]]\" is a more accurate term than \"cyberwar\". He states that \"with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism.\"<ref name=\"Kaspersky1\">[http://www.timesofisrael.com/experts-we-lost-the-cyber-war-now-were-in-the-era-of-cyber-terror/ \"Latest viruses could mean 'end of world as we know it,' says man who discovered Flame\"], ''The Times of Israel'', 6 June 2012</ref> [[Howard Schmidt]], former Cyber Security Coordinator of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]], said that \"there is no cyberwar... I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"<ref name=\"Wired\" />\n\nSome experts take issue with the possible consequences linked to the warfare analogy. Ron Deibert, of Canada's Citizen Lab, has warned of a \"militarization of cyberspace\", as militaristic responses may not be appropriate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deibert|first=Ron|year=2011|title=Tracking the emerging arms race in cyberspace|url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/1/1|journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]|volume=67|issue=1|pages=1\u20138|doi=10.1177/0096340210393703}}</ref> Although, to date, even serious cyber attacks which have disrupted large parts of a nations electrical grids (230,000 customers, [[December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack|Ukraine, 2015]]) or affected access to medical care, thus endangering life (NHS, [[WannaCry ransomware attack|WannaCry, 2017]]) have not led to military action.\n\nOxford academic [[Lucas Kello]] proposed a new term \u2013 \"unpeace\" \u2013 to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non-violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war. Such actions are neither warlike nor peacelike. Although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300220230/virtual-weapon-and-international-order|title=The Virtual Weapon and International Order|last=Kello|first=Lucas|date=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300220230|location=New Haven, Conn.|pages=77\u201379}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=26 August 2017|title=The Politics of Cyberspace: Grasping the Danger|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21727048-academia-still-grappling-problems-beset-computers-and-networks|magazine=[[The Economist]]|location=London|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> This term is closely related to the concept of the \"grey zone\" which has come to prominence in recent years, describing actions which fall below the traditional threshold of war.\n\n=== Cyberwarfare vs. Cyber War ===\nThe term 'cyberwarfare' is distinct from the term 'cyber war'.  \u2018Cyberwarfare\u2019 does not imply scale, protraction or violence which are typically associated with the term \u2018war\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cyber warfare includes techniques, tactics and procedures which may be involved in a cyber war. The term war inherently refers to a large scale action, typically over a protracted period of time and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the aim to kill.<ref name=\":0\" /> A cyber war could accurately describe a protracted period of back-and-forth cyber attacks (including in combination with traditional military action) between nations. To date, no such action is known to have occurred. Instead, [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] military-cyber actions are more commonplace.

Compromise of military systems, such as [[C4ISTAR]] components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.<ref name=Clark2>[http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/top/2010/09/24-11/Clarke-More-defense-needed-in-cyberspace.html \"Clarke: More defense needed in cyberspace\"] HometownAnnapolis.com, 24 September 2010</ref>\n \nIn mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called [[Stuxnet]] that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered \"the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies,\" notes ''The New York Times''.<ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/malware-hits-computerized-industrial-equipment/ \"Malware Hits Computerized Industrial Equipment\"]. ''The New York Times'', 24 September 2010</ref>\n \n[[Stuxnet]], while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost. For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive. The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective. Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences. Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies. A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation. This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage. In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=P.W. |last2=Friedman |first2=Allan |date=2014 |title=Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=156 |isbn=978-0-19-991809-6}}</ref>\n \n==== Denial-of-service attack ====\n{{Main|Denial-of-service attack}}\nIn computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating.

The [[United States Joint Forces Command]] describes some of its attributes:\n\n<blockquote>Cyberspace technology is emerging as an \"instrument of power\" in societies, and is becoming more available to a country's opponents, who may use it to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the flow of information. With low barriers to entry, coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace, the list of potential adversaries is broad.  Furthermore, the globe-spanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nation's ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.<ref name=JOE/></blockquote>\n\nIn February 2010, the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet:<ref name=JOE>[http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf \"The Joint Operating Environment\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810043238/http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf |date=10 August 2013 }}, Joint Forces Command, 18 February 2010, pp. 34\u201336</ref>\n\n<blockquote>With very little investment, and cloaked in a veil of anonymity, our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests. Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication. Indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the U.S. Government and the American population.</blockquote>\n\nOn 6 October 2011, it was announced that [[Creech AFB]]'s [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone and Predator]] fleet's [[command and control]] data stream had been [[keylogging|keylog]]ged, resisting all attempts to reverse the exploit, for the past two weeks.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/10/virus-hits-drone-fleet/ U.S. drone and predator fleet is being keylogged].

{"title_page": "Sharing economy", "text_new": "{{Economic systems sidebar}}\nThe 'share economy' is a concept of a type of economy that is not monetarised, and is not based in a capitalist system. \n\nThe capitalist '''sharing economy''' is a way of purchasing goods and services that differs from the traditional business model of corporations hiring employees to produce products to sell to consumers. In the sharing economy, individuals are said to hire out things like their cars, homes and personal time to other individuals in a peer-to-peer fashion.<ref name=\"thedefinition\">{{cite journal |last=Hamari |first=Juho |last2=Sj\u00f6klint |first2=Mimmi | last3=Ukkonen |first3=Antti |date=2016 | title=The Sharing Economy: Why People Participate in Collaborative Consumption | volume=67 |issue=9 | pages=2047\u20132059|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255698095 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | doi=10.1002/asi.23552}}</ref><ref name=exchange/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f560e5ee-36e8-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f | title=Review \u2013 'The Sharing Economy' | work=[[Financial Times]] | first=Leslie | last=Hook | date=22 June 2016 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Business Models Shaping New Mobility| url=https://www.wsp.com/en-GL/insights/business-models-shaping-new-mobility | work=WSP Global | date=January 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Prieto|first=Marc|last2=Baltas|first2=George|last3=Stan|first3=Valentina|date=2017-07-01|title=Car sharing adoption intention in urban areas: What are the key sociodemographic drivers?|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=101|pages=218\u2013227|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2017.05.012|issn=0965-8564}}</ref>\n\nThere are two main types of capitalist sharing economy enterprises:\n* Initiatives, usually based on the concept of book-lending libraries, in which goods and services are provided for free (or sometimes for a modest subscription). Note that this type of 'share' economy is in the true ethos of a share economy, which is not intended for any one person to make an income, or a profit. \n* Commercial [[business models]] in which a company provides (for a fee) a mobile app that suppliers and customers use to buy and sell goods or services.\n\nIn commercial applications, the sharing economy can be considered a marketing strategy more than an actual 'sharing economy' ethos; for example, the company [[Airbnb]] has sometimes been described as a platform for individuals to 'share' extra space in their homes, but in reality the space is rented, not shared. Airbnb listings additionally are often owned by property management corporations.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/29/the-airbnb-invasion-of-barcelona | title=The Airbnb invasion of Barcelona | first=Rebecca | last=Mead | date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=pretending>{{Cite news | url=http://money.com/money/2933937/sharing-economy-airbnb-uber-monkeyparking/ | title=Can We Stop Pretending the Sharing Economy Is All About Sharing? | last=Tuttle | first=Brad| website=MONEY.com| date=June 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Conceptual characteristics and related concepts==\nThere is a conceptual and semantic confusion caused by the many facets of internet-based sharing leading to discussions regarding the boundaries and the scope of the Sharing Economy<ref name=exchange/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trenz|first=Manuel|last2=Frey|first2=Alexander|last3=Veit|first3=Daniel|date=2018-08-06|title=Disentangling the facets of sharing|journal=Internet Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=888\u2013925|language=en|doi=10.1108/IntR-11-2017-0441|issn=1066-2243}}</ref> and regarding the definition of the sharing economy.<ref name=cheng2016>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Mingming|date=2016|title=Sharing economy: A review and agenda for future research|journal=International Journal of Hospitality Management|volume=57|pages=60\u201370|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2016.06.003}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"sharing economy\" is often used in an ambiguous way and can imply different characteristics.<ref name=schlagwein2019>{{Cite journal|last=Schlagwein|first=Daniel|last2=Schoder|first2=Detlef|last3=Spindeldreher|first3=Kai|date=2019|title=Consolidated, systemic conceptualization, and definition of the \"sharing economy|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|language=en|doi=10.1002/asi.24300}}</ref> For example, The sharing economy is sometimes understood exclusively as a peer-to-peer phenomenon<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gobble|first=MaryAnne M.|date=2015|title=Regulating Innovation in the New Economy|journal=Research Technology Management|volume=58|issue=2|pages=62\u201367|language=en}}</ref> while at times, it has been framed as a business-to-customer phenomenon. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=Harald|date=2013|title=Sharing economy: A potential new pathway to sustainability|journal=Gaia|volume=22|issue=4|pages=228\u2013231|language=en|doi=10.14512/gaia.22.4.5|url=http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/sharing-economy(f53ffbc2-f9bb-4915-a308-e5cceb5ac963).html}}</ref> Additionally, the sharing economy is often understood to encompass transactions with a permanent transfer of ownership of a resource, such as a sale<ref>{{cite book | last1=Botsman | first1=Rachel | last2=Rogers | first2=Roo | title=What's mine is yours.

EBSCOhost, http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=118436221&site=eds-live.</ref> Like taxi services, a [[transportation network company]] (TNC) takes people who live in one common area and transports them to another area. However, to make the initial pick up the driver must be relatively close to the passenger. Urban settings inherently force people to live and work in close proximity. This means that the number of people going to and from similar destinations is going to increase. TNCs realized this and created a business format to take advantage of this new urban setting. In urban settings where there is limited space for housing, people are always hard-pressed to find cheaper housing and rental options when moving from city to city. [[Airbnb]] realized this and was able to take advantage of people who had space they aren't using and rent it out at cheaper costs to the people who need a place to stay for shorter amounts of time.\n\n==Employment models of the sharing economy==\nThe business model of companies situated in the gig economy has been criticised for using technology to evade worker protections such as rights to minimum wages and paid leave and disguising employment relationships as independent contracting/self employment in order to shift costs onto workers. For example, a study by the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute accused Uber of \"creatively leveraging the advantages of its dispatch system in order to evade traditional labour regulations (and other inconvenient taxes and regulations).\"<ref>Jim Stanford, Subsidising Billionaires: Simulating the Net Incomes of UberX Drivers in Australia, Australia Institute, 2018 <http://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Subsidizing_Billionaires_Final.pdf>.</ref> While in traditional industries, workers may enjoy the benefits of [[trade union]]s, healthcare provision, minimum wage, contract termination and working hours rights, employees within the sharing economy are often paid as freelancers. Freelancers do not receive pension benefits or other employee rights and benefits and are often not paid on an hourly basis.\n\nA 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that, across America and England, there were a total of 162 million people that were involved in some type of independent work.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy|title=Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy|website=McKinsey & Company}}</ref> Moreover, their payment is linked to the gigs they perform, which could be deliveries, rentals or other services.<ref>{{cite web | first=Bill | last=Wilson | title=What is the 'gig' economy? | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38930048 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions, legal rulings have classified full-time freelancers working for a single main employer of the gig economy as workers and awarded them regular worker rights and protection. An example is the October 2016 ruling against Uber in the case of [[Uber BV v Aslam]], which supported the claim of two Uber drivers to be classified as workers and to receive the related worker rights and benefits.<ref>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Gingell | title=Gig economy: How workers' rights may be about to change | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gig-economy-workers-rights-change-zero-hour-contracts-permanent-staff-a7719831.html}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to distinguish employment in the sharing economy from employment through [[zero-hour contract]]s, a term primarily used in the United Kingdom. Employment in the gig economy entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator, which, for example, is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order.

It found that global spending in these sectors totaled about $15 billion in 2014, which was only about 5% of the total spending in those areas.

The magazine writes that \"In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants over the threshold to adoption.

This idle time is wasted value that business models and organizations that are based on sharing can potentially utilize.

There is also significant unused value in \"wasted time\", as articulated by [[Clay Shirky]] in his analysis of the power of \"crowds\" connected by information technology. Many people have unused capacity in the course of their day. With social media and information technology, such people can donate small slivers of time to take care of simple tasks that others need doing. Examples of these [[crowdsourcing]] solutions<ref>{{cite web | last1=Boudreau | first1=Kevin | title=Using the Crowd as an Innovation Partner | url=http://hbr.org/2013/04/using-the-crowd-as-an-innovation-partner/ | work=[[Harvard Business Review]] | first2=Karim R. | last2=Lakhani | date=April 2013}}</ref> include the for-profit [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and the non-profit [[Ushahidi]].\n\n===There are sometimes uses for \"waste\"===\nWaste is commonly considered as something that is no longer wanted and needs to be discarded. The challenge with this point of view is that much of what we define as waste still has value that, with proper design and distribution, can safely serve as \"nutrients\" for follow-on processes, unlocking new levels of value in increasingly scarce and expensive resources.

Rising prosperity across the developing world coupled with population growth is putting greater strain on natural resources and has caused a spike in costs and market volatility. This has been increasing pressure on traditional manufacturers to seek design, production and distribution alternatives that will stabilize costs and smooth projected expenditures. In this context, the [[circular economy]] approach has been gaining interest among many global corporate actors. While a handful of pioneering companies are leading the way, wider adoption will rely on mesh economy skills such as the collection and sharing of data, the spread of best practices, and increased collaboration.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sharing brings major benefits to new mobility | url=https://www.wsp.com/en-GL/insights/sharing-brings-major-benefits-to-new-mobility | date=January 2018 | publisher=WSP Global}}</ref> An example of this could be taken from an interview by Arun Sundararajan with Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal suggesting that India's rising middle class might \u2018leap-frog\u2019 car ownership altogether and shift to ride-sharing given car ownerships large inefficiencies in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism| last=Sundararajan| first=Arun| publisher=[[MIT Press]] | year=2016 | pages=116}}</ref> Consumers look for cost-reduction solutions within the sharing economy.

EBSCOhost, http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=118436221&site=eds-live.</ref> Like taxi services, a [[transportation network company]] (TNC) takes people who live in one common area and transports them to another area. However, to make the initial pick up the driver must be relatively close to the passenger. Urban settings inherently force people to live and work in close proximity. This means that the number of people going to and from similar destinations is going to increase. TNCs realized this and created a business format to take advantage of this new urban setting. In urban settings where there is limited space for housing, people are always hard-pressed to find cheaper housing and rental options when moving from city to city. [[Airbnb]] realized this and was able to take advantage of people who had space they aren\u2019t using and rent it out at cheaper costs to the people who need a place to stay for shorter amounts of time.\n\n==Employment models of the sharing economy==\nThe business model of companies situated in the gig economy has been criticised for using technology to evade worker protections such as rights to minimum wages and paid leave and disguising employment relationships as independent contracting/self employment in order to shift costs onto workers. For example, a study by the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute accused Uber of \"creatively leveraging the advantages of its dispatch system in order to evade traditional labour regulations (and other inconvenient taxes and regulations).\"<ref>Jim Stanford, Subsidising Billionaires: Simulating the Net Incomes of UberX Drivers in Australia, Australia Institute, 2018 <http://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Subsidizing_Billionaires_Final.pdf>.</ref> While in traditional industries, workers may enjoy the benefits of [[trade union]]s, healthcare provision, minimum wage, contract termination and working hours rights, employees within the sharing economy are often paid as freelancers. Freelancers do not receive pension benefits or other employee rights and benefits and are often not paid on an hourly basis.\n\nA 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that, across America and England, there were a total of 162 million people that were involved in some type of independent work.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy|title=Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy|website=McKinsey & Company}}</ref> Moreover, their payment is linked to the gigs they perform, which could be deliveries, rentals or other services.<ref>{{cite web | first=Bill | last=Wilson | title=What is the 'gig' economy? | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38930048 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions, legal rulings have classified full-time freelancers working for a single main employer of the gig economy as workers and awarded them regular worker rights and protection. An example is the October 2016 ruling against Uber in the case of [[Uber BV v Aslam]], which supported the claim of two Uber drivers to be classified as workers and to receive the related worker rights and benefits.<ref>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Gingell | title=Gig economy: How workers' rights may be about to change | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gig-economy-workers-rights-change-zero-hour-contracts-permanent-staff-a7719831.html}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to distinguish employment in the sharing economy from employment through [[zero-hour contract]]s, a term primarily used in the United Kingdom. Employment in the gig economy entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator, which, for example, is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order. Although employers do not have to guarantee employment or employees can also refuse to take an order under a zero-hour contract, workers under such a contract are paid by the hour and not directly through business-related indicators as in the case of the gig economy.<ref>{{cite web | title=Distinguishing employment under zero-hour contracts and the gig economy | url=https://fullfact.org/economy/what-gig-economy/}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOne inspiration for the sharing economy was the [[tragedy of the commons]], which refers to the idea that when we all act solely in our self-interest, we deplete the shared resources we need for our own quality of life.

It found that global spending in these sectors totaled about $15 billion in 2014, which was only about 5% of the total spending in those areas. The report also forecasted a possible increase of \"sharing economy\" spending in these areas to $335 billion by 2025, which would be about 50% of the total spending in these five areas.

Through monetizing unused assets, such as renting out a spare guest room on Airbnb, or providing personal services to others, such as becoming a driver with Uber, people are in effect becoming freelance workers. Freelance work entails better opportunities for employment, as well as more flexibility for workers, as people have the ability to pick and choose the time and place of their work. As freelance workers, people can plan around their existing schedules and maintain multiple jobs if needed. Evidence of the appeal to this type of work can be seen from a survey conducted by the Freelancers Union, which shows that around 34% of the U.S. population is involved in freelance work.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/20/uber-and-the-sharing-economy/ | title=3 reasons to cheer Uber and the sharing economy | last=Kumar | first=S.| work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an article by Margarita Hakobyan, freelance work can also be beneficial for small businesses.

The magazine writes that \"In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants over the threshold to adoption.

However, if they are employees, they are granted access to benefits and pay is generally higher. \n\nIn ''Uberland: How the Algorithms are Rewriting the Rules of Work'', technology [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] Alex Rosenblat argues that Uber\u2019s reluctance to classify its drivers as \u201cemployees\u201d strips them of their agency as the company\u2019s revenue-generating workforce, resulting in lower compensation and, in some cases, risking their safety.<ref>{{Cite book|title=UBERLAND : how algorithms are rewriting the rules of work.|last=ROSENBLAT, ALEX.|date=2019|publisher=UNIV OF CALIFORNIA PRESS|isbn=978-0-520-32480-0|location=|pages=138\u2013147|oclc=1088531727}}</ref> In particular, Rosenblat critiques Uber's ratings system, which she argues elevates passengers to the role of \u201c[[Middle management|middle managers]]\u201d without offering drivers the chance to contest poor ratings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=UBERLAND : how algorithms are rewriting the rules of work.|last=Rosenblat|first=Alex|date=2019|publisher=UNIV OF CALIFORNIA PRESS|isbn=978-0-520-32480-0|location=|pages=149|oclc=1088531727}}</ref> Rosenblat notes that poor ratings, or any other number of unspecified breaches of conduct, can result in an Uber driver's \"deactivation,\" an outcome Rosenblat likens to being fired without notice or stated cause.<ref>{{Cite book|title=UBERLAND : how algorithms are rewriting the rules of work.|last=ROSENBLAT, ALEX.|date=2019|publisher=UNIV OF CALIFORNIA PRESS|isbn=978-0-520-32480-0|location=|pages=152|oclc=1088531727}}</ref> Prosecutors have used Uber\u2019s opaque firing policy as evidence of illegal worker misclassification; Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney  leading a class action lawsuit against the company, claims that \"the ability to fire at will is an important factor in showing a company's workers are employees, not independent contractors.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/10/30/uber-driver-firing-policy/|title=How Uber's Shady Firing Policy Could Backfire On The Company|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[California Public Utilities Commission]] filed a case, later settled out of court, that \"addresses the same underlying issue seen in the contract worker controversy\u2014whether the new ways of operating in the sharing economy model should be subject to the same regulations governing traditional businesses\".<ref>{{Cite web\n| url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2015/07/17/sharing-economy-companies-sharing-the-heat-in-contractor-controversy/\n| title=Sharing Economy Companies Sharing the Heat In Contractor Controversy | work=[[Xconomy]] | date=July 17, 2015}}</ref> Like Uber, Instakart too had to face similar lawsuits.

Lawyers representing battered women who have endured other forms of gender-based violence must be aware that these experiences of abuse often intensify the victim's trauma and may require referrals to specialized social service and health care providers as well as to other legal professionals. Advocates for immigrant women may find this situation particularly daunting. Because the violence may have taken place in a different culture, in a form with which you are unfamiliar, your client may have urgent needs that you are unaware of and rights that, as a consequence, are never vindicated. Some of these forms of violence, like trafficking in persons and exploitation in internet marriages, are more common in the cases of clients from industrialized societies. Other types of violence, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, are more frequent in the cases of victims from traditional cultures.<ref name=\"courts.state.ny.us\">Leidholdt, Dorchen; Goodman, Jill Laurie, Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim (PDF) (5th ed.), New York: Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York.</ref>}}\n\nIn \"When Women Defend Pornography\", her chapter in the ''Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism'', Leidholdt wrote:\n\n{{quote|The problem with the ideas of the [[Sex-positive feminism|pro-sex people]] is that they beg important political questions - like how, why, and in whose interest. They fail both to look at [[gender|sexuality]] as a political system and to examine women's position in that system. They make sense in the abstract, but are revealed as critically flawed when measured against women's actual condition in society. They are not feminist, but \"sexual liberationist\". And I put \"sexual liberationist\" in quotes because it has never included the liberation, sexual or otherwise, of women.\n\nAs for the hierarchy of sexual privilege, it too sounds convincing, until you examine the position of women in this hierarchy. [[Heterosexuality]], [[procreation]], and [[marriage]] may mean [[Male privilege|privilege for men]], but they mean something very different for the married woman. Her \"good fortune\" is a one out of three chance of being a battered wife, one out of seven chance of being raped by her own husband, and a statistically undetermined probability that she will be her husbands domestic servant and that her identity will be subsumed in his. The so-called good fortune of [[lesbian feminists]] is either public denigration or invisibility and often loss of jobs and family.}}\n\n== Selected publications ==\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Raymond |editor-first2= Janice | editor-link2 = Janice Raymond |title=The sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location= New York |isbn=9780807762394 }} \n::Essays which originated as speeches and panel presentations at a conference on April 6, 1987, at the New York University Law School\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie | title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | edition = 5th | oclc = 137237540 | url = https://www.legalmomentum.org/sites/default/files/reports/lawyers-manual-on-domestic.pdf }}\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie |title= Lawyer's manual on human trafficking: pursuing justice for victims |year= 2011 |publisher=Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, New York State Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts |location= New York | oclc = 889004609 |url = https://www.nycourts.gov/ip/womeninthecourts/pdfs/LMHT.pdf }}\n\n=== Book Chapters ===\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Pornography in the workplace: sexual harassment litigation under title VII |editor-last1= Lederer |editor-first1= Laura |editor-last2= Delgado |editor-first2= Richard | editor-link1 = Laura Lederer | editor-link2 = Richard Delgado | title = The price we pay: the case against racist speech, hate propaganda, and pornography | publisher = Hill and Wang / Harper Collins | location = US / Canada | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780809015771 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Trafficking in women in Europe | editor-last = Lederer | editor-first = Laura | editor-link = Laura Lederer | title = Sexual politics and the European Union: the new feminist challenge | publisher = Berghahn | location = Providence, Rhode Island | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781571810465 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualpoliticseu0000unse }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Interviewing battered women |editor-last1= Cohen |editor-first1=Ronald E. |editor-last2= Neely |editor-first2= James C. | title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | oclc = 40115035 }} \n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = From sex trafficking to FGM: emerging issues confronting advocates for battered immigrant women |editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie| title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | edition = 5th | oclc = 137237540 | url = https://www.legalmomentum.org/sites/default/files/reports/lawyers-manual-on-domestic.pdf }} <ref name=\"courts.state.ny.us\"/>\n\n=== Journal Articles ===\n* {{cite journal | last =Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | title = Prostitution: a violation of women's human rights | journal = Cardozo Women's Law Journal | volume =1 | issue = 1 | pages = 133\u2013147 | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/cardw1&div=10&id=&page= | ref =  }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/Leidholdt%20Prostitution%20Violation%20of%20Womens%20Human%20Rights.pdf Pdf.]\n* {{cite journal | last =Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | title = Pimping and Prostitution as Sexual Harassment: Amicus Brief on behalf of the New York State Women's Bar Association and the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault in Dilorenzo v.

Her main argument is that [[prostitution]] is exploitative towards women and has historically benefited men, not women.\n\n==Current career==\nLeidholdt is the Director of the [[Center for Battered Women's Legal Services]] at [[Sanctuary for Families]] in [[New York City]]. Under Leidholdt's leadership since 1994, the Center has become the largest legal services program for [[domestic violence]] victims in the country. It has grown from two to twenty-four lawyers and eight support staff members, and has strengthened its advocacy efforts on behalf of under-served populations of women, especially those in New York City's immigrant communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=48|title=Sanctuary for Families {{!}} In love there is no violence|website=Sanctuary for Families|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-22}}</ref> The Center has spearheaded state litigation that set new legal precedent expanding the protections available to domestic violence victims petitioning for orders of protection and federal litigation preventing [[child protective agencies]] from charging battered mothers with \"engaging in domestic violence\".<ref name=\"law.columbia.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Dorchen_Leidholdt|title=Dorchen A.

Lawyers representing battered women who have endured other forms of gender-based violence must be aware that these experiences of abuse often intensify the victim's trauma and may require referrals to specialized social service and health care providers as well as to other legal professionals. Advocates for immigrant women may find this situation particularly daunting. Because the violence may have taken place in a different culture, in a form with which you are unfamiliar, your client may have urgent needs that you are unaware of and rights that, as a consequence, are never vindicated. Some of these forms of violence, like trafficking in persons and exploitation in internet marriages, are more common in the cases of clients from industrialized societies. Other types of violence, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, are more frequent in the cases of victims from traditional cultures.<ref name=\"courts.state.ny.us\">Leidholdt, Dorchen; Goodman, Jill Laurie, Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim (PDF) (5th ed.), New York: Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York.</ref>}}\n\nIn \"When Women Defend Pornography\", her chapter in the ''Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism'', Leidholdt wrote:\n\n{{quote|The problem with the ideas of the [[Sex-positive feminism|pro-sex people]] is that they beg important political questions - like how, why, and in whose interest. They fail both to look at [[gender|sexuality]] as a political system and to examine women's position in that system. They make sense in the abstract, but are revealed as critically flawed when measured against women's actual condition in society. They are not feminist, but \"sexual liberationist\". And I put \"sexual liberationist\" in quotes because it has never included the liberation, sexual or otherwise, of women.\n\nAs for the hierarchy of sexual privilege, it too sounds convincing, until you examine the position of women in this hierarchy. [[Heterosexuality]], [[procreation]], and [[marriage]] may mean [[Male privilege|privilege for men]], but they mean something very different for the married woman. Her \"good fortune\" is a one out of three chance of being a battered wife, one out of seven chance of being raped by her own husband, and a statistically undetermined probability that she will be her husbands domestic servant and that her identity will be subsumed in his. The so-called good fortune of [[lesbian feminists]] is either public denigration or invisibility and often loss of jobs and family.}}\n\n== Selected publications ==\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Raymond |editor-first2= Janice | editor-link2 = Janice Raymond |title=The sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location= New York |isbn=9780807762394 }} \n::Essays which originated as speeches and panel presentations at a conference on April 6, 1987, at the New York University Law School\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie | title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | edition = 5th | oclc = 137237540 | url = https://www.legalmomentum.org/sites/default/files/reports/lawyers-manual-on-domestic.pdf }}\n* {{cite book|editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie |title= Lawyer's manual on human trafficking: pursuing justice for victims |year= 2011 |publisher=Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, New York State Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts |location= New York | oclc = 889004609 |url = https://www.nycourts.gov/ip/womeninthecourts/pdfs/LMHT.pdf }}\n\n=== Book Chapters ===\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Pornography in the workplace: sexual harassment litigation under title VII |editor-last1= Lederer |editor-first1= Laura |editor-last2= Delgado |editor-first2= Richard | editor-link1 = Laura Lederer | editor-link2 = Richard Delgado | title = The price we pay: the case against racist speech, hate propaganda, and pornography | publisher = Hill and Wang / Harper Collins | location = US / Canada | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780809015771 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Trafficking in women in Europe | editor-last = Lederer | editor-first = Laura | editor-link = Laura Lederer | title = Sexual politics and the European Union: the new feminist challenge | publisher = Berghahn | location = Providence, Rhode Island | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781571810465 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualpoliticseu0000unse }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = Interviewing battered women |editor-last1= Cohen |editor-first1=Ronald E. |editor-last2= Neely |editor-first2= James C. | title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | oclc = 40115035 }} \n* {{cite book | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | contribution = From sex trafficking to FGM: emerging issues confronting advocates for battered immigrant women |editor-last1= Leidholdt |editor-first1=Dorchen |editor-last2= Goodman |editor-first2= Jill Laurie| title = Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim | year = 1998 |publisher= Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York |location= New York | edition = 5th | oclc = 137237540 | url = https://www.legalmomentum.org/sites/default/files/reports/lawyers-manual-on-domestic.pdf }} <ref name=\"courts.state.ny.us\"/>\n\n=== Journal Articles ===\n* {{cite journal | last =Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | title = Prostitution: a violation of women's human rights | journal = Cardozo Women's Law Journal | volume =1 | issue = 1 | pages = 133\u2013147 | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/cardw1&div=10&id=&page= | ref =  }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/Leidholdt%20Prostitution%20Violation%20of%20Womens%20Human%20Rights.pdf Pdf.]\n* {{cite journal | last =Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | title = Pimping and Prostitution as Sexual Harassment: Amicus Brief on behalf of the New York State Women's Bar Association and the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault in Dilorenzo v.
