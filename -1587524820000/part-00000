It is named after [[Charles Borromeo McLaughlin]], the first [[Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg]]. An avid pilot, Bishop McLaughlin would meet the pastoral demands of a large diocese by flying from event to event in order to keep pace with his schedule.

The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at [[Furi-Labu railway station|Furi-Labu]] and [[Indode railway station|Indode]]. The line then runs southeast to [[Mojo, Ethiopia|Modjo]] and Adama, both towns located in the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Ethiopian Great Rift Valley]]. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned [[Modjo\u2013Hawassa Railway]]. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the [[Modjo Dry Port]], Ethiopia's most important inland [[dry port]] and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services.\n\nAt Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At [[Awash, Ethiopia|Awash]], there is a junction with the [[Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway]], which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the [[Awash River]] [[canyon]] over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.<ref name=\"uganda2017\"/> The railway then proceeds to [[Dire Dawa]], where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between [[Dewele|Dewale]] and [[Ali Sabieh]], the line reaches the [[Djibouti city|Djibouti]] passenger terminal at [[Nagad railway station]], near [[Djibouti\u2013Ambouli International Airport]]. Freight trains continue the last 12&nbsp;km to the Port of Doraleh on [[diesel engine|diesel power]].\n\n=== Stations ===\n{{further|Railway stations in Ethiopia}}\n\nThere are 21 dedicated railway stations along the railway, all of them can serve as [[passing loop]] stations, as they have three tracks or more (except the Adigala station which has only two tracks). Four of the 21 railway stations are designed as passing loops only, so there is no freight loading / unloading or passenger service. Two of the remaining 17 stations are [[freight yard]]s only and two others will be for passengers only. The remaining 13 stations can handle both passenger services as well as freight loading / unloading.<ref name=\"operationplan\" />\n\nThe 15 passenger stations usually have a single boarding platform, with a station building attached to it. The platforms are about 200, 300, or 400 meters long. The Awash station, the only one with three platforms, is also located along the railway but also at the junction point with the [[Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway]]. The [[Furi-Labu]] and [[Dewele|Dewale]] stations have two platforms.<ref name=\"operationplan\" /> All station buildings along the line contain facilities for ticketing and refreshment, and they even have prayer rooms. The architecture of the station buildings (except that of Awash station) is [[eclecticism|eclectic]], featuring traditional Ethiopian elements with some Chinese interpretation.{{Citation

At [[Awash, Ethiopia|Awash]], there is a junction with the [[Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway]], which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the [[Awash River]] [[canyon]] over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.<ref name=\"uganda2017\"/> The railway then proceeds to [[Dire Dawa]], where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between [[Dewele|Dewale]] and [[Ali Sabieh]], the line reaches the [[Djibouti city|Djibouti]] passenger terminal at [[Nagad railway station]], near [[Djibouti\u2013Ambouli International Airport]]. Freight trains continue the last 12&nbsp;km to the Port of Doraleh on [[diesel engine|diesel power]].\n\n=== Stations ===\n{{further|Railway stations in Ethiopia}}\n\nThere are 21 dedicated railway stations along the railway, all of them can serve as [[passing loop]] stations, as they have three tracks or more (except the Adigala station which has only two tracks). Four of the 21 railway stations are designed as passing loops only, so there is no freight loading / unloading or passenger service. Two of the remaining 17 stations are [[freight yard]]s only and two others will be for passengers only. The remaining 13 stations can handle both passenger services as well as freight loading / unloading.<ref name=\"operationplan\" />\n\nThe 15 passenger stations usually have a single boarding platform, with a station building attached to it. The platforms are about 200, 300, or 400 meters long. The Awash station, the only one with three platforms, is also located along the railway but also at the junction point with the [[Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway]]. The [[Furi-Labu]] and [[Dewele|Dewale]] stations have two platforms.<ref name=\"operationplan\" /> All station buildings along the line contain facilities for ticketing and refreshment, and they even have prayer rooms. The architecture of the station buildings (except that of Awash station) is [[eclecticism|eclectic]], featuring traditional Ethiopian elements with some Chinese interpretation.{{Citation

This is consistent with Chinese railway practice. The single-track sections are equipped with passing loops, each of which is triple-track so that two trains can wait for the main line to clear. Each station also serves as a passing loop.\n\nThe railway line is almost fully electrified. Power is transmitted at 230 kV and 130 kV to eight substations.

However, the accompanying infrastructure was neglected, and the railway was not ready to go into commercial operation at its commissioning.\n\n=== Main issues ===\n\nThe railway line was built without access roads, trunk lines, spur lines, branch lines, storage facilities, goods handling facilities or dry ports. It was official policy to build a \"cheap railway line first\", as the integration work was considered to be \"easy and quick\".<ref name=\"easy-quick\">{{cite web|url=https://addisfortune.net/articles/chinese-company-begins-dire-dawa-port-construction/|title=Chinese Company Begins Dire Dawa Port Construction|date=28 March 2017|publisher=Addis Forune}}</ref> Another official said that railway integration was too complex to consider at the planning stage, as many local authorities would have to coordinate their efforts.<ref name=\"fuelabsence\">{{web cite|url=http://thereporterethiopia.com/content/absence-trunk-lines-operational-depot-hinders-launch-fuel-train-transport|title=Absence of trunk lines, operational depot hinders launch of fuel train transport|date=12 November 2016|publisher=thereporterethiopia.com}}</ref> As one of the many consequences, most railway stations are far outside the city centers and even outside the towns and cities they are intended to serve. For example, the Dire Dawa train station is located 10&nbsp;km away from Dire Dawa. Due to a lack of inter-country coordination, the Port of Doraleh in Djibouti, despite being the main cargo terminus for the railway, was not linked to the railway. No spur lines were built to the three different terminals in question, and the infrastructure for handling bulk goods and fuels was totally missing.<ref name=\"problems-shortages\" /><ref name=\"fuelabsence\" />\n\nAfter the inauguration of the Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway at the end of 2016, the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) in Ethiopia found itself with debt equal to one-third of Ethiopia's annual state budget.

Active in particular was the ''Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Enterprise'' (ESL) to build spurs to facilities like dry ports and the dry ports as such. Construction of the [[Dire Dawa Dry Port]] with a spur line commenced in late 2017.<ref name=\"easy-quick\" /> However, it took 12 months just to negotiate the contract for the dry port construction and the construction works turned out to be much more expensive than originally expected.<ref name=\"easy-quick\" />\n\nThe construction of a spur line to [[Modjo Dry Port]] started in 2017 and was well underway in May 2017.

The Manawatu River was then the main access to the rich hinterland. The west coast of the lower North Island is not naturally supplied with harbours and the Foxton harbour had a dangerous bar at the river mouth. As the only real harbour between Whanganui and Wellington it was used anyway.\n\n== History ==\nFoxton was named after Sir [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], and has a history of [[New Zealand flax|flax]] stripping, which was used to make wool packs, matting and rope. Other industries associated with the town have included clothing manufacturing and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink [[Foxton Fizz]],<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7041966/Fizzing-for-return-to-Foxton Fizzing for return to Foxton]</ref> although the products are now made in [[Putaruru]].<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/6572863/Foxton-Fizz-nabs-Z-contract Foxton Fizz nabs Z contract]</ref>\n\nEarly on, Foxton became a thriving regional centre, and with that status came a newspaper - the Manawatu Herald (est. in 1878).\n\nIt was only with the advent of the [[Palmerston North]]-[[Wellington]] railway that [[Palmerston North]] began to overtake it as the most important centre in the [[Manawatu]].  The central government had originally proposed that Foxton was to be on the route of the main line from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Palmerston North]], and a [[Light rail|tramway]] linking Foxton and [[Palmerston North]] was upgraded into the [[Foxton Branch]] railway in the 1870s.  However, due to government delays in extending the line further south, a group of Wellingtonian businessmen established the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] (WMR), which announced in February 1881 that the \"West Coast\" line would run to Longburn, bypassing Foxton. This was a shorter and more direct route to Napier and Auckland, and avoided \"unproductive country\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cassells |first= K R (Ken) |title= Uncommon Carrier \u2013 The History of the Wellington & Manawatu Railway Company, 1882\u20131908 |year= 1994 |publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]] |location= Wellington  |isbn= 0908573634 |pages= 20, 22 }}</ref>\n\nWhen this line opened in 1886, Foxton's status as a port slipped, and this position deteriorated further when the WMR was incorporated into the government's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] in 1908.

In 1903 the Moutoa Estate was developed as the main supply of flax.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> By 1908 problems with river silting and bar strandings meant that coastal shipping was avoiding Foxton. By 1916 there were only two ships coming into the port<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> but in that year 97,000 bales of flax were shipped out from Foxton.<ref name=\"Esler\" />\n\n===The Whirokino Cut===\nDeforestation of the inland Manawatu District in the late nineteenth century meant increased flooding and led to the creation of stopbanks, floodgates, and the Whirokino Cut.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> Completed in 1943 as part of the Lower Manawatu Flood Control Scheme, it was intended as a spillway but an unexpected flood broke through the upper end and diverted the river down the spillway, cutting off the Foxton loop of the river  and causing great outcry at the time.<ref name=\"Hunt2\">Hunt, A.N. 1968.

The nearby Foxton Beach offers wetlands of international significance with godwits and multiple species of other rare birdlife, and a beach with plenty of surf, swimmers and fishermen and women.\n\n=== Heritage ===\nFoxton is a heritage town in its own right. [[Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom]] and the Cultural Park - with its Dutch windmill De Molen, the Whare Manaaki carving workshop and the [https://www.foxton.org.nz/attr-flax.html Flax Stripper Museum] - are located in the centre of town. The fully restored BNZ building on Main Street, and the oldest cottage in the region 'Nye Cottage' on Harbour Street are both within view of the Park. The 1918 [[Foxton Fizz]] factory can be visited, and the MAVTech Museum provides a fascinating overview of the development of audiovisual technology during the last century. The exhibition is placed within an authentic, restored movie theatre that traces its origins back to 1911 when it first was built as a Coronation Hall. All are within a few minutes walk along Main Street with its many heritage buildings.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe area is sand country with a temperate climate, average monthly temperatures ranging from 8&nbsp;\u00b0C (July) to 17.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (January), with a minimum/maximum of \u22124&nbsp;\u00b0C to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C.

A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter.

The Manawatu River was then the main access to the rich hinterland. The west coast of the lower North Island is not naturally supplied with harbours and the Foxton harbour had a dangerous bar at the river mouth. As the only real harbour between Whanganui and Wellington it was used anyway.\n\n== History ==\nFoxton was named after Sir [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], and has a history of [[New Zealand flax|flax]] stripping, which was used to make wool packs, matting and rope. Other industries associated with the town have included clothing manufacturing and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink [[Foxton Fizz]],<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7041966/Fizzing-for-return-to-Foxton Fizzing for return to Foxton]</ref> although the products are now made in [[Putaruru]].<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/6572863/Foxton-Fizz-nabs-Z-contract Foxton Fizz nabs Z contract]</ref>\n\nEarly on, Foxton became a thriving regional centre, and with that status came a newspaper - the Manawatu Herald (est. in 1878).\n\nIt was only with the advent of the [[Palmerston North]]-[[Wellington]] railway that [[Palmerston North]] began to overtake it as the most important centre in the [[Manawatu]].  The central government had originally proposed that Foxton was to be on the route of the main line from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Palmerston North]], and a [[Light rail|tramway]] linking Foxton and [[Palmerston North]] was upgraded into the [[Foxton Branch]] railway in the 1870s.  However, due to government delays in extending the line further south, a group of Wellingtonian businessmen established the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] (WMR), which announced in February 1881 that the \"West Coast\" line would run to Longburn, bypassing Foxton. This was a shorter and more direct route to Napier and Auckland, and avoided \"unproductive country\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cassells |first= K R (Ken) |title= Uncommon Carrier \u2013 The History of the Wellington & Manawatu Railway Company, 1882\u20131908 |year= 1994 |publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]] |location= Wellington  |isbn= 0908573634 |pages= 20, 22 }}</ref>\n\nWhen this line opened in 1886, Foxton's status as a port slipped, and this position deteriorated further when the WMR was incorporated into the government's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] in 1908. The branch railway closed in 1959, leaving only road access to the town.<ref>Malcolm McKinnon.

In 1903 the Moutoa Estate was developed as the main supply of flax.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> By 1908 problems with river silting and bar strandings meant that coastal shipping was avoiding Foxton. By 1916 there were only two ships coming into the port<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> but in that year 97,000 bales of flax were shipped out from Foxton.<ref name=\"Esler\" />\n\n===The Whirokino Cut===\nDeforestation of the inland Manawatu District in the late nineteenth century meant increased flooding and led to the creation of stopbanks, floodgates, and the Whirokino Cut.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> Completed in 1943 as part of the Lower Manawatu Flood Control Scheme, it was intended as a spillway but an unexpected flood broke through the upper end and diverted the river down the spillway, cutting off the Foxton loop of the river  and causing great outcry at the time.<ref name=\"Hunt2\">Hunt, A.N. 1968.

The nearby Foxton Beach offers wetlands of international significance with godwits and multiple species of other rare birdlife, and a beach with plenty of surf, swimmers and fishermen and women.\n\n=== Heritage ===\nFoxton is a heritage town in its own right. [[Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom]] and the Cultural Park - with its Dutch windmill De Molen, the Whare Manaaki carving workshop and the [https://www.foxton.org.nz/attr-flax.html Flax Stripper Museum] - are located in the centre of town. The fully restored BNZ building on Main Street, and the oldest cottage in the region 'Nye Cottage' on Harbour Street are both within view of the Park. The 1918 [[Foxton Fizz]] factory can be visited, and the MAVTech Museum provides a fascinating overview of the development of audiovisual technology during the last century. The exhibition is placed within an authentic, restored movie theatre that traces its origins back to 1911 when it first was built as a Coronation Hall. All are within a few minutes walk along Main Street with its many heritage buildings.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe area is sand country with a temperate climate, average monthly temperatures ranging from 8&nbsp;\u00b0C (July) to 17.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (January), with a minimum/maximum of \u22124&nbsp;\u00b0C to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C.
