Servicing 37 stations, the line has 46.4&nbsp;km of grade-separated tracks running mostly on underground and elevated guideways. Formerly known as the PUTRA LRT, it is currently operated by [[Rapid KL]], a subsidiary of [[Prasarana Malaysia]]. The line is named after its former terminus, [[Kelana Jaya LRT station|Kelana Jaya station]]. The line is numbered&nbsp;{{Rint|my|5}} and coloured '''<span style=\"color:#{{KLRT color|5}};\">Ruby</span>''' on the official transit map.\n\n== Line information ==\n\n<mapframe text=\"Location of Kelana Jaya LRT line\" width=270 height=400 zoom=11 latitude=3.11445 longitude=101.65519>\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoline\",\n  \"ids\": \"Q248445\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"stroke\": \"#e0115f\",\n    \"stroke-width\": 6\n  }\n}\n</mapframe>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThe line runs from [[Putra Heights]] through [[Kelana Jaya]] to [[Gombak]], serving the [[Subang Jaya]] and [[Petaling Jaya]] regions to the south; southwest and central [[Kuala Lumpur]], and Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the centre; and low density residential areas further north. At 46.4&nbsp;km in length, it is [[List of automated urban metro subway systems|one of the longest]] fully [[automatic train operation|automated driverless metro]] lines in the world.\n\nThe stations are given in a north\u2013south direction, consists primarily of elevated stops and a handful of underground and at-grade stations. Of the 37 stations, 31 are elevated, [[Sri Rampai LRT station|Sri Rampai]] lies at ground level, and five stops ([[Masjid Jamek LRT station|Masjid Jamek]], [[Dang Wangi LRT station|Dangi Wangi]], [[Kampung Baru LRT station|Kampung Baru]], [[KLCC LRT station|KLCC]] and [[Ampang Park LRT station|Ampang Park]]) are underground.\n\nThe stations, like those of the [[Ampang Line|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]], are styled in several types of architectural designs. Elevated stations, in most parts, were constructed in four major styles with distinctive roof designs for specific portions of the line. [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral station]], added later, features a design more consistent with the Stesen Sentral station building. Underground stations, however, tend to feature unique concourse layout and [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]], and feature floor-to-ceiling [[platform screen doors]] to prevent platform-to-track intrusions. 22 stations (including two terminal stations and the five subway stations) use a single [[island platform]], while 15 others use two [[side platform]]s. Stations with island platforms allow easy interchange between north-bound and south-bound trains without requiring one to walk down/up to the concourse level. The island platform at Putra Heights terminal station is shared with the Sri Petaling Line trains bound for Sentul Timur, allowing cross-platform line interchange at the station.\n\nThe stations were built to support [[disability|disabled]] passengers, with [[elevator]]s and [[wheelchair lift]]s alongside [[escalator]]s and [[stairway]]s between the levels. The stations have platform gaps smaller than 5&nbsp;cm to allow easy access for the disabled and wheelchair users. They are able to achieve this with:\n* Tracks that are non-ballasted, lessening rail and train movements.\n* Trains that have direct rubber suspension, lessening train body movements.\n* Trains that do not rapidly run through stations.\n* Stations that have straight platforms.\n\nThe stations on the Kelana Jaya Line are the earliest rapid transit stations in the [[Klang Valley]] designed to provide a degree of accessibility for handicapped users. In contrast, handicapped-friendly facilities for the [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]] were installed beginning in 2012.\n\nThe stations have [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit security cameras]] for security purposes.\n\n===Station list===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black; font-size:95%;\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"color:white\" bgcolor=\"{{KLRT color|5}}\"\n| '''Code'''\n| '''Name'''\n| '''Platform type'''\n| '''Position'''\n| '''Parking bays'''\n| '''Interchange/notes'''\n|-\n|{{KLRT color code|KJ|1}}||'''{{lrts|Gombak}}||[[Terminus station|Terminus]] (Island)|| Elevated ||MSPR: 1,441||\n'''Northern terminus'''.

The extension will be part of a RM10 billion plan to expand [[Public transport in Kuala Lumpur|Kuala Lumpur's public transport network]].\n\nThe expansion plan will also see the [[Ampang Line|Sri Petaling Line]] extended to the suburbs of [[Puchong]] and the south-west of Kuala Lumpur The plan also involved the construction of an entirely new line, tentatively called the [[Kota Damansara\u2013Cheras line]], running from [[Kota Damansara]] in the western portion of the city, to [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]] which lies to the south-east of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAs of August 2008, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] was reportedly running land and engineering studies for the proposed extension.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Two extra LRT lines being studied |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/21/nation/20080821121505&sec=nation |publisher=The Star |date=21 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053942/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F21%2Fnation%2F20080821121505&sec=nation |archivedate=24 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2009, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] began displaying the alignment of the proposed extensions over a 3-month period for feedback.

They consist of two-[[electric multiple unit]]s, which serve as either a driving car or trailer car depending on its direction of travel. The trains use [[linear motor]]s and draw power from a [[third rail]] located at the side of the [[Rail profile|steel rails]]. The plating in between the running rails is used for accelerating and decelerating the train. The reaction plate is semi-magnetised, which pulls the train along as well as helps it to slow down.[[File:Kelana Jaya Line.jpg|thumb|The new [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] 300 for Kelana Jaya Line|alt=]]The ART is completely automated and operates without drivers, stopping at stations for a limited amount of time. Nevertheless, [[manual override]] control panels are provided at each end of the trains for use in an event of an emergency. The technology is essentially identical to that of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]], which operates in very similar environments.\n\nThe interior of the ART, like its [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang  and Sri Petaling Lines]]' counterparts, consists of plastic seating aligned sideways towards the sides of the train, with spacing for passengers on wheelchair, and spacing in the middle for standing occupants. Since its launch in 1998, the ART rolling stock has remained relatively unchanged; only more holding straps have been added and the labeling has been modified from Putra-LRT to [[RapidKL]]. Some of the rolling stock has the majority of the seats removed for added passenger capacity during rush hours.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] signed an agreement with Bombardier [https://www.hartasuma.com/ HARTASUMA] Consortium for the purchase of 88 Mark II ART cars (22 train sets of 4-cars) with an option for another 13 for RM1.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |title=Prasarana Homepage \u2013 Prasarana in RM1.2b deal for 35 LRT trains |website=Prasarana |url-status=dead |archivedate=20 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320142353/http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> The 22 train sets, initially targeted to be delivered from August 2008 onwards, will have four cars each and will boost the carrying capacity of the fleet by 1,500 people.

Each driverless train features a new design for the end caps and curved sidewall structure, with a bigger and more open interior. All trains come in a four-car configuration, with each car accommodating up to 220 passengers. They are equipped with Linear Induction Motor (LIM) propulsion technology which allows for operation on tighter curves, with less noise and greatly reduced wheel and track wear. Low energy consumption is realised through a combination of lightweight aluminium carshells and LIM propulsion system. Furthermore, the vehicle's regenerative braking enables the reuse of energy released during braking. The aisles and walk-through gangways are also wider when compared with the previous fleet. Other than that, the trains are also equipped with 16  cameras onboard each, infotainment LCD screens, dynamic route maps, better air-conditioning and bigger windows. With the new trains, the line can increase its capacity by 20 to 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotransportmagazine.com/21574/news/industry-news/innovia-metro-300-kuala-lumpur/ |title=Driverless INNOVIA Metro 300 fleet enters service in Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Eurotransportmagazine.com |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/05/16/new-improved-trains-brought-in-for-lrt-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New improved trains brought in for LRT Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-05-16 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/01/21/updated-trains-for-lrt-new-fleet-to-increase-passenger-capacity-by-20-on-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New fleet to increase passenger capacity by 20% on Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-01-21 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-consortium-delivers-first-innovia-metro-300-train-for-kuala-lumpur-light-metro-4787787 |title=Bombardier consortium delivers first Innovia Metro 300 train for Kuala Lumpur light metro |publisher=Railway Technology |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Fleet details===\nThe Kelana Jaya Line fleet consisted of the following models:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Servicing 37 stations, the line has 46.4&nbsp;km of grade-separated tracks running mostly on underground and elevated guideways. Formerly known as the PUTRA LRT, it is currently operated by [[Rapid KL]], a subsidiary of [[Prasarana Malaysia]]. The line is named after its former terminus, [[Kelana Jaya LRT station|Kelana Jaya station]]. The line is numbered&nbsp;{{Rint|my|5}} and coloured '''<span style=\"color:#{{KLRT color|5}};\">Ruby</span>''' on the official transit map.\n\n== Line information ==\n\n<mapframe text=\"Location of Kelana Jaya LRT line\" width=270 height=400 zoom=11 latitude=3.11445 longitude=101.65519>\n{\n  \"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n  \"service\": \"geoline\",\n  \"ids\": \"Q248445\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"stroke\": \"#e0115f\",\n    \"stroke-width\": 6\n  }\n}\n</mapframe>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThe line runs from [[Putra Heights]] through [[Kelana Jaya]] to [[Gombak]], serving the [[Subang Jaya]] and [[Petaling Jaya]] regions to the south; southwest and central [[Kuala Lumpur]], and Kuala Lumpur City Centre to the centre; and low density residential areas further north. At 46.4&nbsp;km in length, it is [[List of automated urban metro subway systems|one of the longest]] fully [[automatic train operation|automated driverless metro]] lines in the world.\n\nThe stations are given in a north\u2013south direction, consists primarily of elevated stops and a handful of underground and at-grade stations. Of the 37 stations, 31 are elevated, [[Sri Rampai LRT station|Sri Rampai]] lies at ground level, and five stops ([[Masjid Jamek LRT station|Masjid Jamek]], [[Dang Wangi LRT station|Dangi Wangi]], [[Kampung Baru LRT station|Kampung Baru]], [[KLCC LRT station|KLCC]] and [[Ampang Park LRT station|Ampang Park]]) are underground.\n\nThe stations, like those of the [[Ampang Line|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]], are styled in several types of architectural designs. Elevated stations, in most parts, were constructed in four major styles with distinctive roof designs for specific portions of the line. [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral station]], added later, features a design more consistent with the Stesen Sentral station building. Underground stations, however, tend to feature unique concourse layout and [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]], and feature floor-to-ceiling [[platform screen doors]] to prevent platform-to-track intrusions. 22 stations (including two terminal stations and the five subway stations) use a single [[island platform]], while 15 others use two [[side platform]]s. Stations with island platforms allow easy interchange between north-bound and south-bound trains without requiring one to walk down/up to the concourse level. The island platform at Putra Heights terminal station is shared with the Sri Petaling Line trains bound for Sentul Timur, allowing cross-platform line interchange at the station.\n\nThe stations were built to support [[disability|disabled]] passengers, with [[elevator]]s and [[wheelchair lift]]s alongside [[escalator]]s and [[stairway]]s between the levels. The stations have platform gaps smaller than 5&nbsp;cm to allow easy access for the disabled and wheelchair users. They are able to achieve this with:\n* Tracks that are non-ballasted, lessening rail and train movements.\n* Trains that have direct rubber suspension, lessening train body movements.\n* Trains that do not rapidly run through stations.\n* Stations that have straight platforms.\n\nThe stations on the Kelana Jaya Line are the earliest rapid transit stations in the [[Klang Valley]] designed to provide a degree of accessibility for handicapped users. In contrast, handicapped-friendly facilities for the [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines]] were installed beginning in 2012.\n\nThe stations have [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit security cameras]] for security purposes.\n\n===Station list===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black; font-size:95%;\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"color:white\" bgcolor=\"{{KLRT color|5}}\"\n| '''Code'''\n| '''Name'''\n| '''Platform type'''\n| '''Position'''\n| '''Parking bays'''\n| '''Interchange/notes'''\n|-\n|{{KLRT color code|KJ|1}}||'''{{lrts|Gombak}}||[[Terminus station|Terminus]] (Island)|| Elevated ||MSPR: 1,441||\n'''Northern terminus'''.

The extension will be part of a RM10 billion plan to expand [[Public transport in Kuala Lumpur|Kuala Lumpur's public transport network]].\n\nThe expansion plan will also see the [[Ampang Line|Sri Petaling Line]] extended to the suburbs of [[Puchong]] and the south-west of Kuala Lumpur The plan also involved the construction of an entirely new line, tentatively called the [[Kota Damansara\u2013Cheras line]], running from [[Kota Damansara]] in the western portion of the city, to [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]] which lies to the south-east of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAs of August 2008, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] was reportedly running land and engineering studies for the proposed extension.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Two extra LRT lines being studied |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/21/nation/20080821121505&sec=nation |publisher=The Star |date=21 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053942/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F21%2Fnation%2F20080821121505&sec=nation |archivedate=24 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2009, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] began displaying the alignment of the proposed extensions over a 3-month period for feedback.

They consist of two-[[electric multiple unit]]s, which serve as either a driving car or trailer car depending on its direction of travel. The trains use [[linear motor]]s and draw power from a [[third rail]] located at the side of the [[Rail profile|steel rails]]. The plating in between the running rails is used for accelerating and decelerating the train. The reaction plate is semi-magnetised, which pulls the train along as well as helps it to slow down.[[File:Kelana Jaya Line.jpg|thumb|The new [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] 300 for Kelana Jaya Line|alt=]]The ART is completely automated and operates without drivers, stopping at stations for a limited amount of time. Nevertheless, [[manual override]] control panels are provided at each end of the trains for use in an event of an emergency. The technology is essentially identical to that of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]], which operates in very similar environments.\n\nThe interior of the ART, like its [[Ampang and Sri Petaling lines|Ampang  and Sri Petaling Lines]]' counterparts, consists of plastic seating aligned sideways towards the sides of the train, with spacing for passengers on wheelchair, and spacing in the middle for standing occupants. Since its launch in 1998, the ART rolling stock has remained relatively unchanged; only more holding straps have been added and the labeling has been modified from Putra-LRT to [[RapidKL]]. Some of the rolling stock has the majority of the seats removed for added passenger capacity during rush hours.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, [[Syarikat Prasarana Negara]] signed an agreement with Bombardier [https://www.hartasuma.com/ HARTASUMA] Consortium for the purchase of 88 Mark II ART cars (22 train sets of 4-cars) with an option for another 13 for RM1.2 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |title=Prasarana Homepage \u2013 Prasarana in RM1.2b deal for 35 LRT trains |website=Prasarana |url-status=dead |archivedate=20 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320142353/http://www.prasarana.com.my/TheEdgeTamimi%5B131006%5D.html |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> The 22 train sets, initially targeted to be delivered from August 2008 onwards, will have four cars each and will boost the carrying capacity of the fleet by 1,500 people.

Each driverless train features a new design for the end caps and curved sidewall structure, with a bigger and more open interior. All trains come in a four-car configuration, with each car accommodating up to 220 passengers. They are equipped with Linear Induction Motor (LIM) propulsion technology which allows for operation on tighter curves, with less noise and greatly reduced wheel and track wear. Low energy consumption is realised through a combination of lightweight aluminium carshells and LIM propulsion system. Furthermore, the vehicle's regenerative braking enables the reuse of energy released during braking. The aisles and walk-through gangways are also wider when compared with the previous fleet. Other than that, the trains are also equipped with 16  cameras onboard each, infotainment LCD screens, dynamic route maps, better air-conditioning and bigger windows. With the new trains, the line can increase its capacity by 20 to 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotransportmagazine.com/21574/news/industry-news/innovia-metro-300-kuala-lumpur/ |title=Driverless INNOVIA Metro 300 fleet enters service in Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Eurotransportmagazine.com |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/05/16/new-improved-trains-brought-in-for-lrt-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New improved trains brought in for LRT Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-05-16 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/01/21/updated-trains-for-lrt-new-fleet-to-increase-passenger-capacity-by-20-on-kelana-jaya-line/ |title=New fleet to increase passenger capacity by 20% on Kelana Jaya line - Community &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2016-01-21 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbombardier-consortium-delivers-first-innovia-metro-300-train-for-kuala-lumpur-light-metro-4787787 |title=Bombardier consortium delivers first Innovia Metro 300 train for Kuala Lumpur light metro |publisher=Railway Technology |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Fleet details===\nThe Kelana Jaya Line fleet consisted of the following models:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "Sublimation (psychology)", "text_new": "{{short description|Type defense mechanism where socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are unconsciously transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior}}\nIn [[psychology]], '''sublimation''' is a [[Defense mechanism#Level 4: Mature|mature type]] of [[defense mechanism]], in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.\n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that sublimation was a sign of [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and [[civilization]], allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being \"an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an \"important\" part in civilized life.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud, '[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]' (1930) in The Standard Edition Of ''The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&nbsp;\u2013 The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and its Discontents, and Other Works'', trans. by James Strachey (Hogarth Press; London, 1961), vol.

Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Human, All Too Human, by Friedrich Nietzsche.|work=gutenberg.org}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Psychoanalytic theory ==\nIn Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.\n\nSublimation ({{lang-de|Sublimierung}}) is the process of transforming [[libido]] into \"socially useful\" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as [[Psychological repression|repression]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[intellectualisation]], and [[Psychological projection|projection]]. In ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.<ref>Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (Karnac Books, 2011), p. 44.</ref>\n\nFreud got the idea of '''sublimation''' while reading ''[[Die Harzreise|The Harz Journey]]'' by [[Heinrich Heine]]. The story is about [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be a conflict between the need for satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness. In an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.<ref>Geller, J.(2009). \"Of Snips... and Puppy Dog Tails\": Freud's Sublimation of Judentum. American Imago66(2), 169-184. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 6, 2012, from Project MUSE database.</ref><!-- This section is full of jargon, and the last sentence does not mesh with the one it follows. -->\n\n=== Interpersonal psychoanalysis ===\n[[Harry Stack Sullivan]], the pioneer of [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]], defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social approval for the pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.\n\n== Sexual sublimation ==\n'''Sexual sublimation''', also known as '''sexual transmutation''', is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or \"sexual energy\" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the [[transference]] of sexual energy, or [[libido]], into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief.

Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences, all of which are used to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. Unfortunately, all attempts to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.</ref>\n\nLacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man.

His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.</ref> Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.</ref> Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\"/> in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.\n\nLacan also considers sublimation to be a process of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''{{Hairspace}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.</ref> (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnes\u00e4nger''{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\"/> who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centered around a hole (the vagina<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.</ref>). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation.'<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.</ref> He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Proven\u00e7al verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.</ref> If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).\n\nLacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.</ref> They are primitive and even primordial artifacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.</ref> In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.</ref> and often depict empty spaces through perspective.\n\nIn myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\"/> (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).\n\nLacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behavior can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\"/> As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.</ref> (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.\n\n==Empirical research==\nA study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.<ref name=\"kim13\">{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}</ref>\nThese investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing \"possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"kim13\"/>{{rp|639}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].\n*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].\n*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F.

Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Human, All Too Human, by Friedrich Nietzsche.|work=gutenberg.org}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Psychoanalytic theory ==\nIn Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.\n\nSublimation ({{lang-de|Sublimierung}}) is the process of transforming [[libido]] into \"socially useful\" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as [[Psychological repression|repression]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[intellectualisation]], and [[Psychological projection|projection]]. In ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.<ref>Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (Karnac Books, 2011), p. 44.</ref>\n\nFreud got the idea of '''sublimation''' while reading ''[[Die Harzreise|The Harz Journey]]'' by [[Heinrich Heine]]. The story is about [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be a conflict between the need for satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness. In an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.<ref>Geller, J.(2009). \"Of Snips... and Puppy Dog Tails\": Freud's Sublimation of Judentum.

The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.\n\n== Sexual sublimation ==\n'''Sexual sublimation''', also known as '''sexual transmutation''', is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or \"sexual energy\" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the [[transference]] of sexual energy, or [[libido]], into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief. It is based on the idea that \"sexual energy\" can be used to create a spiritual nature which in turn can create more sensual works, instead of one's sexuality being unleashed \"raw.\"<ref name=\"Sivananda1\">{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Brahmacharya (Celibacy)|url=http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/brahmacharya.htm|accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Samael Aun Weor|authorlink=Samael Aun Weor|title=The Transmutation of Sexual Energy|url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=143&Itemid=43|accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|authorlink=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|title=Cognizantability: Section 2, The Basic Laws of Transmutation|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/mws/mws_cgz_sect-02.html|accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref> The classical example in [[Western religions]] is [[clerical celibacy]].\n\nAs espoused in the [[Tanya]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Likkutei Amarim Tanya I|last=Zalman|first=R.

Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnes\u00e4nger''{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\"/> who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centered around a hole (the vagina<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.</ref>). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation.'<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.</ref> He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Proven\u00e7al verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.</ref> If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).\n\nLacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.</ref> They are primitive and even primordial artifacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.</ref> In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.</ref> and often depict empty spaces through perspective.\n\nIn myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\"/> (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).\n\nLacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behavior can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\"/> As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.</ref> (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.\n\n==Empirical research==\nA study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.<ref name=\"kim13\">{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}</ref>\nThese investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing \"possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"kim13\"/>{{rp|639}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].\n*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].\n*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F. Heatherton]], a more sinister example is given in which a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] becomes a [[surgeon]] or a [[dentist]]. A direct example of this is in the musical and movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' characterized in the descriptively sadistic character of Orin Scrivello who follows his mother's advice to become a dentist, quoting her \"You'll find a way/to make your natural tendencies pay ... Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane.\"\n*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.\n* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.\n* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode \"[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]\", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.\n* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: \"...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strength of the Nipponese.\"\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Abstinence]]\n* [[Agape]]\n* [[Brahmacharya]]\n* [[Catharsis]]\n* [[Classical conditioning]]\n* [[Eroto-comatose lucidity]]\n* [[Witchcraft|Magic]]\n* [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)]]\n* [[Meditation]]\n* [[Neotantra]]\n* [[Philokalia]]\n* [[Pranayama]]\n* [[Sex magic]]\n* [[Shakers]]\n* [[Tantra]]\n* [[Vow of chastity]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.
