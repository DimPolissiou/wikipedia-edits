In 1951, the first Penryhn Road campus buildings opened. Kingston was recognised as a 'Regional College of Technology' by the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] in 1957. In 1970, the College of Technology merged with the College of Art to become Kingston Polytechnic, offering 34 major courses, of which 17 were at degree level.<ref name=kuwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/|title=Our history - Facts and figures|website=Kingston University Website|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> In 1975, Kingston merged with the Gipsy Hill College of Education, incorporating the College's faculty into Kingston's Division of Educational Studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.kingston.ac.uk/documents/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/documents/history-of-kingston-text.pdf|title=A History of Kingston university|last=Gibson|first=Michael|date=1999|publisher=Kingston University|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKingston was granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].
