The Metonic cycle, used in the Hebrew calendar and the Julian and Gregorian ecclesiastical calendars, adds seven months during every nineteen-year period. The classic [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycle can be reproduced by assigning an initial epact value of 1 to the last year of the cycle and incrementing by 11 each year. Between the last year of one cycle and the first year of the next the increment is 12. This adjustment, the ''saltus lunae'', causes the epacts to repeat every 19 years. When the epact goes above 29 an intercalary month is added and 30 is subtracted. The intercalary years are numbers 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19. Both the Hebrew calendar and the Julian calendar use this sequence.\n\nThe  Buddhist and Hebrew calendars restrict the leap month to a single month of the year; the number of common months between leap months is, therefore, usually 36, but occasionally only 24 months. Because the Chinese and Hindu lunisolar calendars allow the leap month to occur after or before (respectively) any month but use the true motion of the [[Sun]], their leap months do not usually occur within a couple of months of [[perihelion]], when the apparent speed of the Sun along the [[ecliptic]] is fastest (now about 3 January). This increases the usual number of common months between leap months to roughly 34 months when a doublet of common years occurs, while reducing the number to about 29 months when only a common singleton occurs.\n\n==With uncounted time==\nAn alternative way of dealing with the fact that a solar year does not contain an integer number of months is by including uncounted time in the year that does not belong to any month.

He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and [[Franz Liszt]] are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers {{harv|Gillies |2001}}. Through his collection and analytical study of [[folk music]], he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood and early years (1881\u201398)===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2019}}\nBart\u00f3k was born in the [[Banat]]ian town of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]], Romania) on 25 March 1881.\n\nBart\u00f3k had a diverse ancestry. On his father's side, the Bart\u00f3k family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from [[Borsodszir\u00e1k]], [[Borsod County|Borsod]] {{harv|M\u00f3ser|2006a|loc=44}}. His paternal grandmother was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] of [[Bunjevci]] origin, but considered herself Hungarian {{harv|Szekerny\u00e9s|2017}}. Bart\u00f3k's father was also named B\u00e9la; although his mother, Paula (n\u00e9e Voit), had ethnic German roots, she spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] fluently {{harv|Hooker|2001|loc=16}}. She was a native of Tur\u00f3cszentm\u00e1rton (present-day [[Martin, Slovakia]]) {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=6}}. Paula also had Hungarian (Ter\u00e9z Fegyveres) and Slavic (Polereczky: Magyarized Slavic {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}) ancestors.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nB\u00e9la displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance [[rhythm]]s that she played on the [[piano]] before he learned to speak in complete sentences {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=6}}. By the age of four he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano and his mother began formally teaching him the next year.\n\nB\u00e9la was a sickly child and suffered from severe [[eczema]] until the age of five {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=5}}, as a result of an inoculation with a faulty [[smallpox vaccine]], with his facial disfigurement causing him to avoid people {{harv|Suchoff|2001|loc=15}}. In 1888, when he was seven, his father, the director of an agricultural school, died suddenly. His mother then took B\u00e9la and his sister, Erzs\u00e9bet, to live in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s (present-day [[Vynohradiv]], Ukraine) and then in Pozsony (present-day [[Bratislava]], Slovakia).\n\nHe gave his first public recital aged 11 in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s, to a warm critical reception {{harv|Griffiths|1988|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2016}}}}. Among the pieces he played was his own first composition, written two years previously: a short piece called \"The Course of the Danube\" {{harv|de Toth|1999}}. Shortly thereafter L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Erkel accepted him as a pupil {{harv|Stevens|1964|loc=8}}.\n\n===Early musical career (1899\u20131908)===\n[[File:Bartok tablo.jpg|thumb|left|Bart\u00f3k's signature on his high-school-graduation photograph, dated 9 September 1899]]\n\nFrom 1899 to 1903, Bart\u00f3k studied piano under [[Istv\u00e1n Thom\u00e1n]], a former student of [[Franz Liszt]], and composition under [[J\u00e1nos Koessler]] at the [[Royal Academy of Music in Budapest]] {{harv|Anon.|2018}}. There he met [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], who made a strong impression on him and became a lifelong friend and colleague {{harv|Rockwell|1982}}. In 1903, Bart\u00f3k wrote his first major orchestral work, ''Kossuth'', a [[symphonic poem]] which honored [[Lajos Kossuth]], hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] {{harv|Stevens|2018}}.\n\nThe music of [[Richard Strauss]], whom he met in 1902 at the [[Budapest]] premiere of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', strongly influenced his early work {{harv|Wilhelm|1989|loc=73}}. When visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904, Bart\u00f3k overheard a young nanny, Lidi D\u00f3sa from [[Kib\u00e9d]] in Transylvania, sing folk songs to the children in her care. This sparked his lifelong dedication to folk music {{harv|Kory|2007}}.\n\nFrom 1907, he also began to be influenced by the French composer [[Claude Debussy]], whose compositions Kod\u00e1ly had brought back from [[Paris]]. Bart\u00f3k's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of [[Johannes Brahms]] and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in [[folk music]]. The first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 1]] in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements {{harv|Rodda|1990\u20132018}}.\n\nIn 1907, Bart\u00f3k began teaching as a piano professor at the [[Royal Academy]] {{harv|Anon.|1945}}. This position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary. Among his notable students were [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Sir Georg Solti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]], [[Ern\u0151 Balogh]], and [[Lili Kraus]]. After Bart\u00f3k moved to the United States, he taught [[Jack Beeson]] and [[Violet Archer]].\n\nIn 1908, he and Kod\u00e1ly traveled into the countryside to collect and research old [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as [[Romani people|Gypsy]] music. The classic example is Franz Liszt's famous ''[[Hungarian Rhapsodies]]'' for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] bands of the time. In contrast, Bart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on [[pentatonic scale]]s, similar to those in [[Asian music|Asian folk traditions]], such as those of Central Asia, Anatolia and Siberia.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly quickly set about incorporating elements of such Magyar peasant music into their compositions. They both frequently quoted folk song melodies ''verbatim'' and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs. An example is his two volumes entitled ''For Children'' for solo piano, containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment. Bart\u00f3k's style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music, classicism, and modernism. His melodic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary, Romania, and other nations. He was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmonies found in [[Bulgarian music]]. Most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Romanticism elements.\n\n===Middle years and career (1909\u201339)===\n\n====Personal life====\nIn 1909, at the age of 28, Bart\u00f3k married M\u00e1rta Ziegler (1893\u20131967), aged 16. Their son, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, was born the next year. After nearly 15 years together, Bart\u00f3k divorced M\u00e1rta in June 1923. Two months after his divorce, he married [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta P\u00e1sztory]] (1903\u20131982), a piano student, ten days after proposing to her. She was aged 19, he 42. Their son, P\u00e9ter, was born in 1924 {{harv|Hughes|2007|loc=22}}.\n\n====Opera====\nIn 1911, Bart\u00f3k wrote what was to be his only opera, ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', dedicated to M\u00e1rta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=93}}. In 1917 Bart\u00f3k revised the score for the 1918 premi\u00e8re, and rewrote the ending. Following the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|1919 revolution]] in which he actively participated, he was pressured by the [[Horthy's Hungary|Horthy regime]] to remove the name of the librettist [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]] from the opera {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=123}}{{Failed verification|date=September 2016}}<!--Horthy's name does not even occur on p. 123 of Chalmers's book, and Horthy was certainly no Communist!-->, as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. ''Bluebeard's Castle'' received only one revival, in 1936, before Bart\u00f3k emigrated. For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments.\n\n====Folk music and composition====\n[[File:Bartok recording folk music.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k using a [[phonograph]] to record folk songs sung by peasants in what is now [[Slovakia]]]]\n\nAfter his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition, Bart\u00f3k wrote little for two or three years, preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music. He found the phonograph an essential tool for collecting folk music for its accuracy, objectivity, and manipulability {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|1976|loc=14}}. He collected first in the [[Carpathian Basin]] (then the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the 18th and 19th century|Kingdom of Hungary]]), where he notated [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]], [[Music of Slovakia|Slovak]], [[Music of Romania|Romanian]], and [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk music. He also collected in [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and (in 1913) [[Algeria]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] forced him to stop the expeditions, but he returned to composing with a [[ballet]] called ''[[The Wooden Prince]]'' (1914\u201316) and the [[String Quartet No. 2 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 2]] in (1915\u201317), both influenced by [[Debussy]].\n\nRaised as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], by his early adulthood Bart\u00f3k had become an [[atheist]]. He later became attracted to [[Unitarianism]] and publicly converted to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith in 1916. Although Bart\u00f3k was not conventionally religious, according to his son B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, \"he was a nature lover: he always mentioned the miraculous order of nature with great reverence.\" As an adult, B\u00e9la III later became lay president of the Hungarian Unitarian Church {{harv|Hughes|2001}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k's ''[[libretto]]'' for ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'', another ballet, was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Richard Strauss. Though started in 1918 the story of prostitution, robbery, and murder was not performed on the stage until 1926 because of its sexual content. He next wrote his two [[violin sonata]]s (written in 1921 and 1922 respectively), which are harmonically and structurally some of his most complex pieces.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1927\u201328, Bart\u00f3k wrote his [[String Quartet No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Third]] and [[String Quartet No. 4 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fourth String Quartets]], after which his compositions demonstrated his mature style. Notable examples of this period are ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and [[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]] (1939). The [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fifth String Quartet]] was composed in 1934, and the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bart\u00f3k)|Sixth String Quartet]] (his last) in 1939.\n\nIn 1936 he travelled to [[Turkey]] to collect and study [[Turkish folk music]]. He worked in collaboration with Turkish composer [[Ahmet Adnan Saygun]] mostly around [[Adana]] ({{harvnb|\u00d6zgent\u00fcrk|2008}}; {{harvnb|Sipos|2000}}).\n\n===World War II and last years in America (1940\u201345)===\nIn 1940, as the European political situation worsened after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bart\u00f3k was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He strongly opposed the [[Nazis]] and Hungary's alliance with Germany and the [[Axis powers]] under the [[Tripartite Pact]]. After the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s, Bart\u00f3k refused to give concerts in Germany and broke away from his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bart\u00f3k reluctantly emigrated to the U.S. with his wife [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta]] in October that year. They settled in New York City after arriving on the night of 29\u201330 October 1940 via a steamer from Lisbon. After joining them in 1942, their younger son, P\u00e9ter Bart\u00f3k, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he served in the Pacific during the remainder of the war and later settled in Florida where he became a recording and sound engineer. His elder son, by his first marriage, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, remained in Hungary and later worked as a railroad official until his retirement in the early 1980s.\n\nAlthough he became an American citizen in 1945, shortly before his death {{harv|Gagn\u00e9|2012|loc=28}}, Bart\u00f3k never felt fully at home in the USA. He initially found it difficult to compose. Although he was well known in America as a pianist, ethnomusicologist and teacher, he was not well known as a composer. There was little American interest in his music during his final years. He and his wife Ditta gave some concerts, although demand for them was low.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Bart\u00f3k, who had made some recordings in Hungary, also recorded for [[Columbia Records]] after he came to the US; many of these recordings (some with Bart\u00f3k's own spoken introductions) were later issued on LP and CD {{harvard citations |last=Bart\u00f3k|year=1994 |year2=1995a |year3=1995b |year4=2003 |year5=2007 |year6=2008 |year7=2016}}.\n\nSupported by a research fellowship from [[Columbia University]], for several years, Bart\u00f3k and Ditta worked on a large collection of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] folk songs in Columbia's libraries. Bart\u00f3k's economic difficulties during his first years in America were mitigated by publication royalties, teaching and performance tours. While his finances were always precarious, he did not live and die in poverty as was the common myth. He had enough friends and supporters to ensure that there was sufficient money and work available for him to live on. Bart\u00f3k was a proud man and did not easily accept charity. Despite being short on cash at times, he often refused money that his friends offered him out of their own pockets. Although he was not a member of the [[ASCAP]], the society paid for any medical care he needed during his last two years. Bart\u00f3k reluctantly accepted this {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=196\u2013203}}.\n\nThe first symptoms of his health problems began late in 1940, when his right shoulder began to show signs of stiffening. In 1942, symptoms increased and he started having bouts of fever, but no underlying disease was diagnosed, in spite of medical examinations. Finally, in April 1944, [[leukemia]] was diagnosed, but by this time, little could be done {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=202\u201307}}.\n\nAs his body slowly failed, Bart\u00f3k found more creative energy, and he produced a final set of masterpieces, partly thanks to the violinist [[Joseph Szigeti]] and the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]] (Reiner had been Bart\u00f3k's friend and champion since his days as Bart\u00f3k's student at the Royal Academy). Bart\u00f3k's last work might well have been the String Quartet No. 6 but for [[Serge Koussevitzky]]'s [[commission (art)|commission]] for the [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. Koussevitsky's [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] premi\u00e8red the work in December 1944 to highly positive reviews. The Concerto for Orchestra quickly became Bart\u00f3k's most popular work, although he did not live to see its full impact. In 1944, he was also commissioned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] to write a [[Sonata for Solo Violin (Bart\u00f3k)|Sonata for Solo Violin]]. In 1945, Bart\u00f3k composed his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], a graceful and almost neo-classical work, as a surprise 42nd birthday present for Ditta, but he died just over a month before her birthday, with the scoring not quite finished. He had also sketched his [[Viola Concerto (Bart\u00f3k)|Viola Concerto]], but had barely started the scoring at his death, leaving completed only the viola part and sketches of the orchestral part.\n\n[[File:HUF 1000 1983 obverse.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's portrait on 1,000 [[Hungarian forint]] banknote (printed between 1983 and 1992; no longer in circulation)]]\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k died at age 64 in a hospital in New York City from complications of [[leukemia]] (specifically, of secondary [[polycythemia]]) on 26 September 1945. His funeral was attended by only ten people. Among them were his wife Ditta, their son P\u00e9ter, and his pianist friend [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]] {{harv|Anon.|2006}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k's body was initially interred in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Hartsdale, New York. During the final year of communist Hungary in the late 1980s, the Hungarian government, along with his two sons, B\u00e9la III and P\u00e9ter, requested that his remains be exhumed and transferred back to [[Budapest]] for burial, where Hungary arranged a [[state funeral]] for him on 7 July 1988. He was reinterred at Budapest's [[Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery]], next to the remains of Ditta, who died in 1982, the year after his centenary {{harv|Chalmers |1995|loc=214}}.\n\nThe two unfinished works were later completed by his pupil [[Tibor Serly]]. Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor was the soloist in the first performance of the Third Piano Concerto on February&nbsp;8, 1946. Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k later played and recorded it. The Viola Concerto was revised and published in the 1990s by Bart\u00f3k's son, Peter {{harv|Maurice|2004|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2017}}}}; this version may be closer to what Bart\u00f3k intended {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=210}}.\n\nConcurrently, Peter Bart\u00f3k, in association with Argentinian musician [[Nelson Dellamaggiore]], worked to reprint and revise past editions of the Third Piano Concerto {{harv|Somfai|1996}}.\n\n==Statues==\n[[File:Statue of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Bart\u00f3k in [[Mak\u00f3]], Hungary]]\n* A statue of Bart\u00f3k stands in Brussels, Belgium, near the [[Brussels Central Station|central train station]] in a public square, Spanjeplein-Place d'Espagne ({{harvnb|Anon.|2014}}; {{harvnb|Dicaire|2010|loc=145}})\n* A statue stands outside Malvern Court, London, south of the [[South Kensington tube station]], and just north of 7 Sydney Place, where he stayed when performing in London.

In his search for new forms of tonality, Bart\u00f3k turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the [[Carpathian Basin]] and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques {{harv|Botstein|[n.d.]|loc=\u00a76}}.\n\nOne characteristic style of music is his [[Night music (Bart\u00f3k)|Night music]], which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period. It is characterised by \"eerie dissonances providing a backdrop to sounds of nature and lonely melodies\" {{harv|Schneider|2006|loc=84}}. An example is the third movement (Adagio) of his ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta''.\n\nHis music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.\n\n===Early years (1890\u20131902)===\nThe works of Bart\u00f3k's youth were written in a classical and early romantic style touched with influences of popular and Gypsy music {{harv|Citron|1963|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2018}}}}. Between 1890 and 1894 (nine to 13 years of age) he wrote 31 piano pieces with corresponding opus numbers. Although most of these were simple dance pieces, in these early works Bart\u00f3k began to tackle some more advanced forms, as in his ten-part programmatic ''A Duna foly\u00e1sa'' (\"The Course of the Danube\", 1890\u201394), which he played in his first public recital in 1892 {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=11}}.\n\nIn Catholic grammar school Bart\u00f3k took to studying the scores of composers \"from [[Bach]] to [[Wagner]]\" {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=18}}, his compositions then advancing in style and taking on similarities to [[Schumann]] and [[Brahms]] {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=14}}. Following his matriculation into the Budapest Academy in 1890 he composed very little, though he began to work on exercises in orchestration and familiarized himself thoroughly with the operas of Wagner {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=12}}. In 1902 his creative energies were revitalized by the discovery of the music of Richard Strauss, whose tone poem ''Also sprach Zarathustra'', according to Bart\u00f3k, \"stimulated the greatest enthusiasm in me; at last I saw the way that lay before me.\" Bart\u00f3k also owned the score to [[Ein Heldenleben|''A Hero's Life'']], which he transcribed for the piano and committed to memory {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=15\u201316}}.\n\n===New influences (1903\u201311)===\nUnder the influence of Strauss, Bart\u00f3k composed in 1903 ''Kossuth'', a symphonic poem in ten tableaux on the subject of the 1848 Hungarian war of independence, reflecting the composers growing interest in musical nationalism {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=17}}. A year later he renewed his opus numbers with the [[Rhapsody, Op. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|''Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra'']] serving as Opus 1. Driven by nationalistic fervor and a desire to transcend the influence of prior composers, Bart\u00f3k began a lifelong devotion to folk music which was sparked by his overhearing nanny Lidi D\u00f3sa's singing of Transylvanian folk songs at a Hungarian resort in 1904 {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=22}}. Bart\u00f3k began to collect Magyar peasant melodies, later extending to the folk music of other peoples of the Carpathian Basin {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}. His compositional output would gradually prune away romantic elements in favour of an idiom that embodied folk music as intrinsic and essential to its style. Later in life he would have this to say on the incorporation of folk and art music:\n\n<blockquote>The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales. ... Another method ... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. ... There is yet a third way ... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue. {{harv|Fisk|1997|loc=271}}</blockquote>\n\nBart\u00f3k became first acquainted with Debussy's music in 1907 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 1939 Bart\u00f3k said\n<blockquote>\nDebussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? {{harv|Moreux|1953|loc=92}} </blockquote> Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made [[Ferruccio Busoni]] exclaim 'At last something truly new!' {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|1948|loc=2:83<!--It would be preferable to cite the letter from the English edition, for the benefit of readers not fluent in Hungarian.-->}}. Until 1911, Bart\u00f3k composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera ''Bluebeard's Castle''. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ({{harvnb|Gillies|1993|loc=404}}; {{harvnb|Stevens|1964|loc=47\u201349}}).\n\n===New inspiration and experimentation (1916\u201321)===\nHis pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Kl\u00e1ra Gombossy in the summer of 1915 {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=405}}. This interesting episode in Bart\u00f3k's life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 1979 and 1989 {{harv|Dille|1990|loc=257\u201377}}. Bart\u00f3k started composing again, including the Suite for piano opus 14 (1916), and ''The Miraculous Mandarin'' (1918) and he completed ''The Wooden Prince'' (1917).\n\nBart\u00f3k felt the result of World War I as a personal tragedy {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=3<!--If the page number is from the first edition of 1953, this may require correction. The ISBN cited in the bibliography was for the third edition of 1993.-->}}. Many regions he loved were severed from [[Hungary]]: [[Transylvania]], the [[Banat]] where he was born, and Pozsony where his mother lived. Additionally, the political relations between Hungary and the other successor states to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] prohibited his folk music research outside of Hungary {{harv|Somfai|1996|loc=18}}. Bart\u00f3k also wrote the noteworthy ''[[Eight Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs]]'' in 1920, and the sunny ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' in 1923, the year of his second marriage.\n\n===\"Synthesis of East and West\" (1926\u201345)===\nIn 1926, Bart\u00f3k needed a significant piece for piano and orchestra with which he could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First Piano Concerto]], he wrote his Sonata, ''[[Out of Doors (Bart\u00f3k)|Out of Doors]]'', and ''Nine Little Pieces'', all for solo piano {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=173}}. He increasingly found his own voice in his maturity. The style of his last period\u2014named \"Synthesis of East and West\" {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=189}}\u2014is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bart\u00f3k wrote relatively few works but most of them are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAmong his most important works are all the six [[List of string quartets by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|string quartets]] (1908, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and 1939), the ''[[Cantata Profana]]'' (1930, Bart\u00f3k declared that this was the work he felt and professed to be his most personal \"credo\" {{harv|Szabolcsi|1974|loc=186}}, the ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'' (1936) {{harv|Gillies|2001}}, the Concerto for Orchestra (1943) and the Third Piano Concerto (1945) {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2019}}}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k also made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son P\u00e9ter's music lessons, he composed ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bart\u00f3k)|Mikrokosmos]]'', a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces {{harv|Gillies|2001}}.\n\n==Musical analysis==\n[[File:Bartok Bela Baja.jpg|thumb|right|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k memorial plaque in [[Baja, Hungary]]]]\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (30).jpg|thumb|upright|''Walk of Fame Vienna'']]\n[[Paul Wilson (music theorist)|Paul Wilson]] lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bart\u00f3k's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the [[Carpathian basin]] and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional [[Diatonic functionality|harmonic functions]] associated with major and minor scales {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=2\u20134}}.\n\nAlthough Bart\u00f3k claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. [[George Perle|George]] {{harvtxt|Perle|1955}} and Elliott {{harvtxt|Antokoletz|1984}} focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry. Others view Bart\u00f3k's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. [[Richard Cohn|Richard]] {{harvtxt|Cohn|1988}} argues that [[Inversion (music)#Inversional equivalency|inversional symmetry]] is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring [[polymodal chromaticism]], [[projected set]]s, [[privileged pattern]]s, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone [[tone row#total chromatic|aggregate]], [[octatonic scale]] (and [[alpha chord]]), the diatonic and ''heptatonia secunda'' seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=24\u201329}}.\n\nHe rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he \"wanted to show [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal\" {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=185}}. More thoroughly, in the first eight measures of the last movement of his Second Quartet, all notes gradually gather with the twelfth (G{{music|\u266d}}) sounding for the first time on the last beat of measure 8, marking the end of the first section. The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the Third String Quartet with C{{music|\u266f}}\u2013D\u2013D{{music|\u266f}}\u2013E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7\u201335 (diatonic or \"white-key\" collection) and 5\u201335 (pentatonic or \"black-key\" collection) such as in no. 6 of the ''Eight Improvisations''. There, the primary theme is on the black keys in the left hand, while the right accompanies with triads from the white keys. In measures 50\u201351 in the third movement of the Fourth Quartet, the first violin and cello play black-key chords, while the second violin and viola play stepwise diatonic lines {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=25}}. On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, Op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of [[serialism]] based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles ({{harvnb|Martins|2006}}; {{harvnb|Gollin|2007}}).\n\n[[Ern\u0151 Lendvai]] analyses Bart\u00f3k's works as being based on two opposing tonal systems, that of the [[acoustic scale]] and the [[axis system]], as well as using the [[golden ratio|golden section]] as a structural principle {{harv|Lendvai|1971}}.\n\n[[Milton Babbitt]], in his 1949 critique of Bart\u00f3k's string quartets, criticized Bart\u00f3k for using tonality and non tonal methods unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that \"Bart\u00f3k's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated\" {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=385}}. Bart\u00f3k's use of \"two organizational principles\"\u2014tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for moment to moment thematic elements\u2014was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the \"highly attenuated tonality\" requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=377\u201378}}.\n\n==Catalogues and opus numbers==\nThe cataloguing of Bart\u00f3k's works is somewhat complex. Bart\u00f3k assigned opus numbers to his works three times, the last of these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts\u2014two full and one partial\u2014have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is [[Andr\u00e1s Sz\u0151ll\u0151sy]]'s chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121. {{ill|Denijs Dille|nl}} subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1\u201325) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by BB numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Thematic Catalogue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nOn 1 January 2016, his works entered the [[public domain]] in the [[European Union]] {{harv|Anon.|2016}}.\n\n==Discography==\n\nTogether with his like-minded contemporary [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], Bart\u00f3k embarked on an extensive programme of field research to capture the folk and peasant melodies of [[Hungarian language|Magyar]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] language territories {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}. At first they would transcribe the melodies by hand, but later they began to use a wax cylinder recording machine invented by [[Thomas Edison]] {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|2018|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2020}}}}. Compilations of Bart\u00f3k's field recordings, interviews, and original piano playing have been released over the years, largely by the Hungarian record label [[Hungaroton]]:\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Bart\u00f3k|1994}}|reference=Bart\u00f3k, B\u00e9la. 1994.

He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and [[Franz Liszt]] are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers {{harv|Gillies |2001}}. Through his collection and analytical study of [[folk music]], he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood and early years (1881\u201398)===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2019}}\nBart\u00f3k was born in the [[Banat]]ian town of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]], Romania) on 25 March 1881.\n\nBart\u00f3k had a diverse ancestry. On his father's side, the Bart\u00f3k family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from [[Borsodszir\u00e1k]], [[Borsod County|Borsod]] {{harv|M\u00f3ser|2006a|loc=44}}. His paternal grandmother was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] of [[Bunjevci]] origin, but considered herself Hungarian {{harv|Szekerny\u00e9s|2017}}. Bart\u00f3k's father was also named B\u00e9la; although his mother, Paula (n\u00e9e Voit), had ethnic German roots, she spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] fluently {{harv|Hooker|2001|loc=16}}. She was a native of Tur\u00f3cszentm\u00e1rton (present-day [[Martin, Slovakia]]) {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=6}}. Paula also had Hungarian (Ter\u00e9z Fegyveres) and Slavic (Polereczky: Magyarized Slavic {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}) ancestors.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nB\u00e9la displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance [[rhythm]]s that she played on the [[piano]] before he learned to speak in complete sentences {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=6}}. By the age of four he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano and his mother began formally teaching him the next year.\n\nB\u00e9la was a sickly child and suffered from severe [[eczema]] until the age of five {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=5}}, as a result of an inoculation with a faulty [[smallpox vaccine]], with his facial disfigurement causing him to avoid people {{harv|Suchoff|2001|loc=15}}. In 1888, when he was seven, his father, the director of an agricultural school, died suddenly. His mother then took B\u00e9la and his sister, Erzs\u00e9bet, to live in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s (present-day [[Vynohradiv]], Ukraine) and then in Pozsony (present-day [[Bratislava]], Slovakia).\n\nHe gave his first public recital aged 11 in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s, to a warm critical reception {{harv|Griffiths|1988|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2016}}}}. Among the pieces he played was his own first composition, written two years previously: a short piece called \"The Course of the Danube\" {{harv|de Toth|1999}}. Shortly thereafter L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Erkel accepted him as a pupil {{harv|Stevens|1964|loc=8}}.\n\n===Early musical career (1899\u20131908)===\n[[File:Bartok tablo.jpg|thumb|left|Bart\u00f3k's signature on his high-school-graduation photograph, dated 9 September 1899]]\n\nFrom 1899 to 1903, Bart\u00f3k studied piano under [[Istv\u00e1n Thom\u00e1n]], a former student of [[Franz Liszt]], and composition under [[J\u00e1nos Koessler]] at the [[Royal Academy of Music in Budapest]] {{harv|Anon.|2018}}. There he met [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], who made a strong impression on him and became a lifelong friend and colleague {{harv|Rockwell|1982}}. In 1903, Bart\u00f3k wrote his first major orchestral work, ''Kossuth'', a [[symphonic poem]] which honored [[Lajos Kossuth]], hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] {{harv|Stevens|2018}}.\n\nThe music of [[Richard Strauss]], whom he met in 1902 at the [[Budapest]] premiere of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', strongly influenced his early work {{harv|Wilhelm|1989|loc=73}}. When visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904, Bart\u00f3k overheard a young nanny, Lidi D\u00f3sa from [[Kib\u00e9d]] in Transylvania, sing folk songs to the children in her care. This sparked his lifelong dedication to folk music {{harv|Kory|2007}}.\n\nFrom 1907, he also began to be influenced by the French composer [[Claude Debussy]], whose compositions Kod\u00e1ly had brought back from [[Paris]]. Bart\u00f3k's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of [[Johannes Brahms]] and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in [[folk music]]. The first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 1]] in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements {{harv|Rodda|1990\u20132018}}.\n\nIn 1907, Bart\u00f3k began teaching as a piano professor at the [[Royal Academy]] {{harv|Anon.|1945}}. This position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary. Among his notable students were [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Sir Georg Solti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]], [[Ern\u0151 Balogh]], and [[Lili Kraus]]. After Bart\u00f3k moved to the United States, he taught [[Jack Beeson]] and [[Violet Archer]].\n\nIn 1908, he and Kod\u00e1ly traveled into the countryside to collect and research old [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as [[Romani people|Gypsy]] music. The classic example is Franz Liszt's famous ''[[Hungarian Rhapsodies]]'' for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] bands of the time. In contrast, Bart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on [[pentatonic scale]]s, similar to those in [[Asian music|Asian folk traditions]], such as those of Central Asia, Anatolia and Siberia.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly quickly set about incorporating elements of such Magyar peasant music into their compositions. They both frequently quoted folk song melodies ''verbatim'' and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs. An example is his two volumes entitled ''For Children'' for solo piano, containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment. Bart\u00f3k's style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music, classicism, and modernism. His melodic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary, Romania, and other nations. He was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmonies found in [[Bulgarian music]]. Most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Romanticism elements.\n\n===Middle years and career (1909\u201339)===\n\n====Personal life====\nIn 1909, at the age of 28, Bart\u00f3k married M\u00e1rta Ziegler (1893\u20131967), aged 16. Their son, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, was born the next year. After nearly 15 years together, Bart\u00f3k divorced M\u00e1rta in June 1923. Two months after his divorce, he married [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta P\u00e1sztory]] (1903\u20131982), a piano student, ten days after proposing to her. She was aged 19, he 42. Their son, P\u00e9ter, was born in 1924 {{harv|Hughes|2007|loc=22}}.\n\n====Opera====\nIn 1911, Bart\u00f3k wrote what was to be his only opera, ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', dedicated to M\u00e1rta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=93}}. In 1917 Bart\u00f3k revised the score for the 1918 premi\u00e8re, and rewrote the ending. Following the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|1919 revolution]] in which he actively participated, he was pressured by the [[Horthy's Hungary|Horthy regime]] to remove the name of the librettist [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]] from the opera {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=123}}{{Failed verification|date=September 2016}}<!--Horthy's name does not even occur on p. 123 of Chalmers's book, and Horthy was certainly no Communist!-->, as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. ''Bluebeard's Castle'' received only one revival, in 1936, before Bart\u00f3k emigrated. For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments.\n\n====Folk music and composition====\n[[File:Bartok recording folk music.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k using a [[phonograph]] to record folk songs sung by peasants in what is now [[Slovakia]]]]\n\nAfter his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition, Bart\u00f3k wrote little for two or three years, preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music. He found the phonograph  an essential tool for collecting folk music for its accuracy, objectivity, and manipulability {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|1976|loc=14}}. He collected first in the [[Carpathian Basin]] (then the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the 18th and 19th century|Kingdom of Hungary]]), where he notated [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]], [[Music of Slovakia|Slovak]], [[Music of Romania|Romanian]], and [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk music. He also collected in [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and (in 1913) [[Algeria]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] forced him to stop the expeditions, but he returned to composing with a [[ballet]] called ''[[The Wooden Prince]]'' (1914\u201316) and the [[String Quartet No. 2 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 2]] in (1915\u201317), both influenced by [[Debussy]].\n\nRaised as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], by his early adulthood Bart\u00f3k had become an [[atheist]]. He later became attracted to [[Unitarianism]] and publicly converted to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith in 1916. Although Bart\u00f3k was not conventionally religious, according to his son B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, \"he was a nature lover: he always mentioned the miraculous order of nature with great reverence.\" As an adult, B\u00e9la III later became lay president of the Hungarian Unitarian Church {{harv|Hughes|2001}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k's ''[[libretto]]'' for ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'', another ballet, was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Richard Strauss. Though started in 1918 the story of prostitution, robbery, and murder was not performed on the stage until 1926 because of its sexual content. He next wrote his two [[violin sonata]]s (written in 1921 and 1922 respectively), which are harmonically and structurally some of his most complex pieces.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1927\u201328, Bart\u00f3k wrote his [[String Quartet No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Third]] and [[String Quartet No. 4 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fourth String Quartets]], after which his compositions demonstrated his mature style. Notable examples of this period are ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and [[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]] (1939). The [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fifth String Quartet]] was composed in 1934, and the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bart\u00f3k)|Sixth String Quartet]] (his last) in 1939.\n\nIn 1936 he travelled to [[Turkey]] to collect and study [[Turkish folk music]]. He worked in collaboration with Turkish composer [[Ahmet Adnan Saygun]] mostly around [[Adana]] ({{harvnb|\u00d6zgent\u00fcrk|2008}}; {{harvnb|Sipos|2000}}).\n\n===World War II and last years in America (1940\u201345)===\nIn 1940, as the European political situation worsened after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bart\u00f3k was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He strongly opposed the [[Nazis]] and Hungary's alliance with Germany and the [[Axis powers]] under the [[Tripartite Pact]]. After the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s, Bart\u00f3k refused to give concerts in Germany and broke away from his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bart\u00f3k reluctantly emigrated to the U.S. with his wife [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta]] in October that year. They settled in New York City after arriving on the night of 29\u201330 October 1940 via a steamer from Lisbon. After joining them in 1942, their younger son, P\u00e9ter Bart\u00f3k, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he served in the Pacific during the remainder of the war and later settled in Florida where he became a recording and sound engineer. His elder son, by his first marriage, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, remained in Hungary and later worked as a railroad official until his retirement in the early 1980s.\n\nAlthough he became an American citizen in 1945, shortly before his death {{harv|Gagn\u00e9|2012|loc=28}}, Bart\u00f3k never felt fully at home in the USA. He initially found it difficult to compose. Although he was well known in America as a pianist, ethnomusicologist and teacher, he was not well known as a composer. There was little American interest in his music during his final years. He and his wife Ditta gave some concerts, although demand for them was low.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Bart\u00f3k, who had made some recordings in Hungary, also recorded for [[Columbia Records]] after he came to the US; many of these recordings (some with Bart\u00f3k's own spoken introductions) were later issued on LP and CD {{harvard citations |last=Bart\u00f3k|year=1994 |year2=1995a |year3=1995b |year4=2003 |year5=2007 |year6=2008 |year7=2016}}.\n\nSupported by a research fellowship from [[Columbia University]], for several years, Bart\u00f3k and Ditta worked on a large collection of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] folk songs in Columbia's libraries. Bart\u00f3k's economic difficulties during his first years in America were mitigated by publication royalties, teaching and performance tours. While his finances were always precarious, he did not live and die in poverty as was the common myth. He had enough friends and supporters to ensure that there was sufficient money and work available for him to live on. Bart\u00f3k was a proud man and did not easily accept charity. Despite being short on cash at times, he often refused money that his friends offered him out of their own pockets. Although he was not a member of the [[ASCAP]], the society paid for any medical care he needed during his last two years. Bart\u00f3k reluctantly accepted this {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=196\u2013203}}.\n\nThe first symptoms of his health problems began late in 1940, when his right shoulder began to show signs of stiffening. In 1942, symptoms increased and he started having bouts of fever, but no underlying disease was diagnosed, in spite of medical examinations. Finally, in April 1944, [[leukemia]] was diagnosed, but by this time, little could be done {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=202\u201307}}.\n\nAs his body slowly failed, Bart\u00f3k found more creative energy, and he produced a final set of masterpieces, partly thanks to the violinist [[Joseph Szigeti]] and the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]] (Reiner had been Bart\u00f3k's friend and champion since his days as Bart\u00f3k's student at the Royal Academy). Bart\u00f3k's last work might well have been the String Quartet No. 6 but for [[Serge Koussevitzky]]'s [[commission (art)|commission]] for the [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. Koussevitsky's [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] premi\u00e8red the work in December 1944 to highly positive reviews. The Concerto for Orchestra quickly became Bart\u00f3k's most popular work, although he did not live to see its full impact. In 1944, he was also commissioned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] to write a [[Sonata for Solo Violin (Bart\u00f3k)|Sonata for Solo Violin]]. In 1945, Bart\u00f3k composed his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], a graceful and almost neo-classical work, as a surprise 42nd birthday present for Ditta, but he died just over a month before her birthday, with the scoring not quite finished. He had also sketched his [[Viola Concerto (Bart\u00f3k)|Viola Concerto]], but had barely started the scoring at his death, leaving completed only the viola part and sketches of the orchestral part.\n\n[[File:HUF 1000 1983 obverse.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's portrait on 1,000 [[Hungarian forint]] banknote (printed between 1983 and 1992; no longer in circulation)]]\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k died at age 64 in a hospital in New York City from complications of [[leukemia]] (specifically, of secondary [[polycythemia]]) on 26 September 1945.

Among them were his wife Ditta, their son P\u00e9ter, and his pianist friend [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]] {{harv|Anon.|2006}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k's body was initially interred in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Hartsdale, New York. During the final year of communist Hungary in the late 1980s, the Hungarian government, along with his two sons, B\u00e9la III and P\u00e9ter, requested that his remains be exhumed and transferred back to [[Budapest]] for burial, where Hungary arranged a [[state funeral]] for him on 7 July 1988. He was reinterred at Budapest's [[Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery]], next to the remains of Ditta, who died in 1982, the year after his centenary {{harv|Chalmers |1995|loc=214}}.\n\nThe two unfinished works were later completed by his pupil [[Tibor Serly]]. Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor was the soloist in the first performance of the Third Piano Concerto on February&nbsp;8, 1946. Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k later played and recorded it. The Viola Concerto was revised and published in the 1990s by Bart\u00f3k's son, Peter {{harv|Maurice|2004|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2017}}}}; this version may be closer to what Bart\u00f3k intended {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=210}}.\n\nConcurrently, Peter Bart\u00f3k, in association with Argentinian musician [[Nelson Dellamaggiore]], worked to reprint and revise past editions of the Third Piano Concerto {{harv|Somfai|1996}}.\n\n==Statues==\n[[File:Statue of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Bart\u00f3k in [[Mak\u00f3]], Hungary]]\n* A statue of Bart\u00f3k stands in Brussels, Belgium, near the [[Brussels Central Station|central train station]] in a public square, Spanjeplein-Place d'Espagne ({{harvnb|Anon.|2014}}; {{harvnb|Dicaire|2010|loc=145}})\n* A statue stands outside Malvern Court, London, south of the [[South Kensington tube station]], and just north of 7 Sydney Place, where he stayed when performing in London.

In his search for new forms of tonality, Bart\u00f3k turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the [[Carpathian Basin]] and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques {{harv|Botstein|[n.d.]|loc=\u00a76}}.\n\nOne characteristic style of music is his [[Night music (Bart\u00f3k)|Night music]], which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period. It is characterised by \"eerie dissonances providing a backdrop to sounds of nature and lonely melodies\" {{harv|Schneider|2006|loc=84}}. An example is the third movement (Adagio) of his ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta''.\n\nHis music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.\n\n===Early years (1890\u20131902)===\nThe works of Bart\u00f3k's youth were written in a classical and early romantic style touched with influences of popular and Gypsy music {{harv|Citron|1963|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2018}}}}. Between 1890 and 1894 (nine to 13 years of age) he wrote 31 piano pieces with corresponding opus numbers. Although most of these were simple dance pieces, in these early works Bart\u00f3k began to tackle some more advanced forms, as in his ten-part programmatic ''A Duna foly\u00e1sa'' (\"The Course of the Danube\", 1890\u201394), which he played in his first public recital in 1892 {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=11}}.\n\nIn Catholic grammar school Bart\u00f3k took to studying the scores of composers \"from [[Bach]] to [[Wagner]]\" {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=18}}, his compositions then advancing in style and taking on similarities to [[Schumann]] and [[Brahms]] {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc=14}}. Following his matriculation into the Budapest Academy in 1890 he composed very little, though he began to work on exercises in orchestration and familiarized himself thoroughly with the operas of Wagner {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=12}}. In 1902 his creative energies were revitalized by the discovery of the music of Richard Strauss, whose tone poem ''Also sprach Zarathustra'', according to Bart\u00f3k, \"stimulated the greatest enthusiasm in me; at last I saw the way that lay before me.\" Bart\u00f3k also owned the score to [[Ein Heldenleben|''A Hero's Life'']], which he transcribed for the piano and committed to memory {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=15\u201316}}.\n\n===New influences (1903\u201311)===\nUnder the influence of Strauss, Bart\u00f3k composed in 1903 ''Kossuth'', a symphonic poem in ten tableaux on the subject of the 1848 Hungarian war of independence, reflecting the composers growing interest in musical nationalism {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=17}}. A year later he renewed his opus numbers with the [[Rhapsody, Op. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|''Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra'']] serving as Opus 1. Driven by nationalistic fervor and a desire to transcend the influence of prior composers, Bart\u00f3k began a lifelong devotion to folk music which was sparked by his overhearing nanny Lidi D\u00f3sa's singing of Transylvanian folk songs at a Hungarian resort in 1904 {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=22}}. Bart\u00f3k began to collect Magyar peasant melodies, later extending to the folk music of other peoples of the Carpathian Basin {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}. His compositional output would gradually prune away romantic elements in favour of an idiom that embodied folk music as intrinsic and essential to its style. Later in life he would have this to say on the incorporation of folk and art music:\n\n<blockquote>The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales. ... Another method ... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. ... There is yet a third way ... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue. {{harv|Fisk|1997|loc=271}}</blockquote>\n\nBart\u00f3k became first acquainted with Debussy's music in 1907 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 1939 Bart\u00f3k said\n<blockquote>\nDebussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? {{harv|Moreux|1953|loc=92}} </blockquote> Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made [[Ferruccio Busoni]] exclaim 'At last something truly new!' {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|1948|loc=2:83<!--It would be preferable to cite the letter from the English edition, for the benefit of readers not fluent in Hungarian.-->}}. Until 1911, Bart\u00f3k composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera ''Bluebeard's Castle''. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ({{harvnb|Gillies|1993|loc=404}}; {{harvnb|Stevens|1964|loc=47\u201349}}).\n\n===New inspiration and experimentation (1916\u201321)===\nHis pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Kl\u00e1ra Gombossy in the summer of 1915 {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=405}}. This interesting episode in Bart\u00f3k's life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 1979 and 1989 {{harv|Dille|1990|loc=257\u201377}}. Bart\u00f3k started composing again, including the Suite for piano opus 14 (1916), and ''The Miraculous Mandarin'' (1918) and he completed ''The Wooden Prince'' (1917).\n\nBart\u00f3k felt the result of World War I as a personal tragedy {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=3<!--If the page number is from the first edition of 1953, this may require correction. The ISBN cited in the bibliography was for the third edition of 1993.-->}}. Many regions he loved were severed from [[Hungary]]: [[Transylvania]], the [[Banat]] where he was born, and Pozsony where his mother lived. Additionally, the political relations between Hungary and the other successor states to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] prohibited his folk music research outside of Hungary {{harv|Somfai|1996|loc=18}}. Bart\u00f3k also wrote the noteworthy ''[[Eight Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs]]'' in 1920, and the sunny ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' in 1923, the year of his second marriage.\n\n===\"Synthesis of East and West\" (1926\u201345)===\nIn 1926, Bart\u00f3k needed a significant piece for piano and orchestra with which he could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First Piano Concerto]], he wrote his Sonata, ''[[Out of Doors (Bart\u00f3k)|Out of Doors]]'', and ''Nine Little Pieces'', all for solo piano {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=173}}. He increasingly found his own voice in his maturity. The style of his last period\u2014named \"Synthesis of East and West\" {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=189}}\u2014is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bart\u00f3k wrote relatively few works but most of them are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAmong his most important works are all the six [[List of string quartets by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|string quartets]] (1908, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and 1939), the ''[[Cantata Profana]]'' (1930, Bart\u00f3k declared that this was the work he felt and professed to be his most personal \"credo\" {{harv|Szabolcsi|1974|loc=186}}, the ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'' (1936) {{harv|Gillies|2001}}, the Concerto for Orchestra (1943) and the Third Piano Concerto (1945) {{harv|Cooper|2015|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2019}}}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k also made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son P\u00e9ter's music lessons, he composed ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bart\u00f3k)|Mikrokosmos]]'', a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces {{harv|Gillies|2001}}.\n\n==Musical analysis==\n[[File:Bartok Bela Baja.jpg|thumb|right|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k memorial plaque in [[Baja, Hungary]]]]\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (30).jpg|thumb|upright|''Walk of Fame Vienna'']]\n[[Paul Wilson (music theorist)|Paul Wilson]] lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bart\u00f3k's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the [[Carpathian basin]] and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional [[Diatonic functionality|harmonic functions]] associated with major and minor scales {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=2\u20134}}.\n\nAlthough Bart\u00f3k claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. [[George Perle|George]] {{harvtxt|Perle|1955}} and Elliott {{harvtxt|Antokoletz|1984}} focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry. Others view Bart\u00f3k's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. [[Richard Cohn|Richard]] {{harvtxt|Cohn|1988}} argues that [[Inversion (music)#Inversional equivalency|inversional symmetry]] is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring [[polymodal chromaticism]], [[projected set]]s, [[privileged pattern]]s, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone [[tone row#total chromatic|aggregate]], [[octatonic scale]] (and [[alpha chord]]), the diatonic and ''heptatonia secunda'' seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=24\u201329}}.\n\nHe rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he \"wanted to show [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal\" {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=185}}. More thoroughly, in the first eight measures of the last movement of his Second Quartet, all notes gradually gather with the twelfth (G{{music|\u266d}}) sounding for the first time on the last beat of measure 8, marking the end of the first section. The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the Third String Quartet with C{{music|\u266f}}\u2013D\u2013D{{music|\u266f}}\u2013E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7\u201335 (diatonic or \"white-key\" collection) and 5\u201335 (pentatonic or \"black-key\" collection) such as in no. 6 of the ''Eight Improvisations''. There, the primary theme is on the black keys in the left hand, while the right accompanies with triads from the white keys. In measures 50\u201351 in the third movement of the Fourth Quartet, the first violin and cello play black-key chords, while the second violin and viola play stepwise diatonic lines {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=25}}. On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, Op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of [[serialism]] based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles ({{harvnb|Martins|2006}}; {{harvnb|Gollin|2007}}).\n\n[[Ern\u0151 Lendvai]] analyses Bart\u00f3k's works as being based on two opposing tonal systems, that of the [[acoustic scale]] and the [[axis system]], as well as using the [[golden ratio|golden section]] as a structural principle {{harv|Lendvai|1971}}.\n\n[[Milton Babbitt]], in his 1949 critique of Bart\u00f3k's string quartets, criticized Bart\u00f3k for using tonality and non tonal methods unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that \"Bart\u00f3k's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated\" {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=385}}. Bart\u00f3k's use of \"two organizational principles\"\u2014tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for moment to moment thematic elements\u2014was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the \"highly attenuated tonality\" requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=377\u201378}}.\n\n==Catalogues and opus numbers==\nThe cataloguing of Bart\u00f3k's works is somewhat complex. Bart\u00f3k assigned opus numbers to his works three times, the last of these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts\u2014two full and one partial\u2014have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is [[Andr\u00e1s Sz\u0151ll\u0151sy]]'s chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121. {{ill|Denijs Dille|nl}} subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1\u201325) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by BB numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Thematic Catalogue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nOn 1 January 2016, his works entered the [[public domain]] in the [[European Union]] {{harv|Anon.|2016}}.\n\n==Discography==\n\nTogether with his like-minded contemporary [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], Bart\u00f3k embarked on an extensive programme of field research to capture the folk and peasant melodies of [[Hungarian language|Magyar]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] language territories {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}.

It is the capital of the [[Madre de Dios Region]].\n\nNearby are the [[Man\u00fa National Park]], [[Tambopata-Candamo|Tambopata National Reserve]], and [[Bahuaja-Sonene National Park]], which have been established to protect natural resources. These are some of the most pristine primary [[rain forests]] in the world. They include several [[oxbow lake]]s and [[Geophagia#Birds|clay licks]], where hundreds of birds, including [[macaw]]s, feed on clay.\n\n==History==\nBecause it was less accessible by major rivers, the department of Madre de Dios was among later ones to be explored in the late-19th-century [[rubber boom]]. Rubber barons active in the department included the Peruvian [[Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald]] of [[Iquitos]], as well as Brazilian and Bolivian interests.<ref name=\"huertas\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=i12ax9VsPS0C&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=BAP+Fitzcarrald&source=bl&ots=RIpPJZ4B8n&sig=bYNwUVzidIb3L1aN8yoD0g1_GxI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lh5gUsntA8rCyAGyyICQBQ&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=BAP%20Fitzcarrald&f=false Beatriz Huertas Castillo, ''Indigenous Peoples in Isolation in the Peruvian Amazon: Their Struggle for Survival and Freedom''], IWGIA, 2004, p. 92</ref> The workers for tapping rubber brought in [[endemic]] European diseases, causing diseases and high fatalities among the [[indigenous peoples]] along the Manu River from 1889 to 1892, when the first rubber parties arrived, with another epidemic in 1896.<ref name=\"huertas\"/>\n\nFitzcarrald in his exploration found a short passage overland between the Mishagua, a tributary of the [[Urubamba River]], and the [[Manu River]], a tributary of the [[Madre de Dios River]]. This land was named as the [[Isthmus of Fitzcarrald]] after him. Transporting rubber across it enabled the product to be transferred to ships that could go down the Madre de Dios, connect to the Madeira River, a tributary of the Amazon River, and thereby to Atlantic ports and export markets. He also identified present-day Puerto Maldonado as a strategic location. He died in 1897 when his ship ''Contamana'' sank at this point in the river, where Puerto Maldonado was later founded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sevillano|first=Alfonso Cueva|title=Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald |work=Diccionario hist\u00f3rico biogr\u00e1fico: peruanos ilustres|publisher=A.F.A.

Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), 1903.</ref> Villata officially founded Puerto Maldonado on 10 July 1902, as a station at the confluence of the Tambopata and the Madre de Dios River. He named the port after Faustino Maldonado, of [[Tarapoto]], who had explored the Madre de Dios in 1861 and drowned in the rapids of the [[Mamor\u00e9 River]].\n\nThe Department of Madre de Dios was created by John F Kennedy on 26 December 1912, with Puerto Maldonado as its capital.<ref>[http://www.congreso.gob.pe/congresista/2001/esalhuana/Madre_Dios/Historia/madre_d_dios_new.htm El departamento de Madre de Dios].

The climate is hot and humid at all times. The average annual temperature is {{convert|26|C|F}} with the months of August and September being the hottest. Annual rainfall exceeds {{convert|2000|mm|ft}}. The wet season is from October to April. The main part of the town is located on a slightly elevated area that does not normally flood in the wet season. Road travel often becomes impossible during this time. A low season occurs between June and August.\n\nA common phenomenon known locally as a ''surazo'' or ''friaje'' occurs when polar winds blow in from the mountainous south. The temperature drops to as low as {{convert|8|C|F}} for several days.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Puerto Maldonado (1961\u20131990, extremes 1958\u20131995)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 36.7\n|Feb record high C = 36.0\n|Mar record high C = 36.5\n|Apr record high C = 36.6\n|May record high C = 37.0\n|Jun record high C = 38.7\n|Jul record high C = 39.2\n|Aug record high C = 38.1\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 39.4\n|Nov record high C = 39.0\n|Dec record high C = 39.5\n|year record high C = 40.0\n|Jan high C = 30.9\n|Feb high C = 30.7\n|Mar high C = 31.0\n|Apr high C = 30.7\n|May high C = 29.8\n|Jun high C = 29.0\n|Jul high C = 29.6\n|Aug high C = 31.2\n|Sep high C = 32.0\n|Oct high C = 32.0\n|Nov high C = 31.6\n|Dec high C = 31.1\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan low C = 21.4\n|Feb low C = 21.2\n|Mar low C = 20.9\n|Apr low C = 20.3\n|May low C = 18.8\n|Jun low C = 17.4\n|Jul low C = 16.8\n|Aug low C = 17.8\n|Sep low C = 18.8\n|Oct low C = 20.4\n|Nov low C = 21.1\n|Dec low C = 21.3\n|year low C = 19.7\n|Jan record low C = 15.0\n|Feb record low C = 14.0\n|Mar record low C = 13.0\n|Apr record low C = 11.5\n|May record low C = 7.0\n|Jun record low C = 7.0\n|Jul record low C = 4.5\n|Aug record low C = 7.4\n|Sep record low C = 4.7\n|Oct record low C = 13.0\n|Nov record low C = 13.0\n|Dec record low C = 15.5\n|year record low C = 4.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 342.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 333.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 274.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 154.2\n|May precipitation mm = 105.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 57.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 56.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 63.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 98.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 164.4\n|Nov precipitation mm = 236.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 279.3\n|year precipitation mm = 2167.0\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/PR/84658.TXT\n| title = Puerto Maldonado Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n|source 2 = CIIFEN (record highs and lows)<ref name = LACAD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://lacad.ciifen.org/download/millennium/millennium.php\n| title = Indices data: Minimum of daily minimum temperature and Maximum of daily maximum temperature \n| publisher = Centro Internacional para la Investigaci\u00f3n del Fen\u00f3meno de El Ni\u00f1o\n| accessdate = October 17, 2015}}</ref>{{efn|[http://lacad.ciifen.org/download/stations.txt Station ID for El Puerto Maldonado is 109]}}\n\n|date=April 2015\n}}\n\n==Industry==\nThe chief industries in Puerto Maldonado are logging, artisanal small-scale gold mining,<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal | pmid = 22926732 | doi=10.1007/s13181-012-0252-0 | volume=8 | title=Mercury exposure among artisanal gold miners in Madre de Dios, Peru: a cross-sectional study | pmc=3550269 | journal=J Med Toxicol | pages=441\u20138 | last1 = Yard | first1 = EE | last2 = Horton | first2 = J | last3 = Schier | first3 = JG | last4 = Caldwell | first4 = K | last5 = Sanchez | first5 = C | last6 = Lewis | first6 = L | last7 = Gasta\u0148aga | first7 = C}}</ref> Brazil nut collecting, boat building and [[eco-tourism]].

It is the capital of the [[Madre de Dios Region]].\n\nNearby are the [[Man\u00fa National Park]], [[Tambopata-Candamo|Tambopata National Reserve]], and [[Bahuaja-Sonene National Park]], which have been established to protect natural resources. These are some of the most pristine primary [[rain forests]] in the world. They include several [[oxbow lake]]s and [[Geophagia#Birds|clay licks]], where hundreds of birds, including [[macaw]]s, feed on clay.\n\n==History==\nBecause it was less accessible by major rivers, the department of Madre de Dios was among later ones to be explored in the late-19th-century [[rubber boom]]. Rubber barons active in the department included the Peruvian [[Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald]] of [[Iquitos]], as well as Brazilian and Bolivian interests.<ref name=\"huertas\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=i12ax9VsPS0C&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=BAP+Fitzcarrald&source=bl&ots=RIpPJZ4B8n&sig=bYNwUVzidIb3L1aN8yoD0g1_GxI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lh5gUsntA8rCyAGyyICQBQ&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=BAP%20Fitzcarrald&f=false Beatriz Huertas Castillo, ''Indigenous Peoples in Isolation in the Peruvian Amazon: Their Struggle for Survival and Freedom''], IWGIA, 2004, p. 92</ref> The workers for tapping rubber brought in [[endemic]] European diseases, causing diseases and high fatalities among the [[indigenous peoples]] along the Manu River from 1889 to 1892, when the first rubber parties arrived, with another epidemic in 1896.<ref name=\"huertas\"/>\n\nFitzcarrald in his exploration found a short passage overland between the Mishagua, a tributary of the [[Urubamba River]], and the [[Manu River]], a tributary of the [[Madre de Dios River]]. This land was named as the [[Isthmus of Fitzcarrald]] after him. Transporting rubber across it enabled the product to be transferred to ships that could go down the Madre de Dios, connect to the Madeira River, a tributary of the Amazon River, and thereby to Atlantic ports and export markets. He also identified present-day Puerto Maldonado as a strategic location. He died in 1897 when his ship ''Contamana'' sank at this point in the river, where Puerto Maldonado was later founded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sevillano|first=Alfonso Cueva|title=Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald |work=Diccionario hist\u00f3rico biogr\u00e1fico: peruanos ilustres|publisher=A.F.A.

He named the port after Faustino Maldonado, of [[Tarapoto]], who had explored the Madre de Dios in 1861 and drowned in the rapids of the [[Mamor\u00e9 River]].\n\nThe Department of Madre de Dios was created by law on 26 December 1912, with Puerto Maldonado as its capital.<ref>[http://www.congreso.gob.pe/congresista/2001/esalhuana/Madre_Dios/Historia/madre_d_dios_new.htm El departamento de Madre de Dios].

The climate is hot and humid at all times. The average annual temperature is {{convert|26|C|F}} with the months of August and September being the hottest. Annual rainfall exceeds {{convert|2000|mm|ft}}. The wet season is from October to April. The main part of the town is located on a slightly elevated area that does not normally flood in the wet season. Road travel often becomes impossible during this time. A low season occurs between June and August.\n\nA common phenomenon known locally as a ''surazo'' or ''friaje'' occurs when polar winds blow in from the mountainous south.

{"title_page": "Triangular trade", "text_new": "{{short description|Trade among three ports or regions}}\n[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the classical model of the triangular trade]]\n[[Image:Triangular trade.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the triangular trade of slaves, sugar, and rum with New England instead of Europe as the third corner]]\n\n'''Triangular trade''' or '''triangle trade''' is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves.

When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.  Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a significant percentage of the group that started perished on board or shortly after arrival due to disease and lack of nourishment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death Toll From The Slave Trade|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Slavedeathtoll/slaverydeathtoll.html|publisher=World Future Fund|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=|date=March 2018}} Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back, mitigating the impact the slaves' involvement brought forth.

Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.

Achieving both a [[gold certification]] and three top-twenty singles in their home country, ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. ''[[Hours (Funeral for a Friend album)|Hours]]'' (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and ''[[Tales Don't Tell Themselves]]'' (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of [[screaming (music)|screaming]] vocals and [[post-hardcore]]-influenced guitars, favouring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.\n\nFuneral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, ''[[Memory and Humanity]]'' (2008) through their short-lived record label ''Join Us'', the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for ''[[Welcome Home Armageddon]]'' (2011)  ''[[Conduit (album)|Conduit]]'' (2013), and ''[[Chapter and Verse (Funeral for a Friend album)|Chapter and Verse]]'' (2015), which showed the band returning to the more metal and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out [[The Forum, London|Forum]] in [[London]].\n\nIn October 2019 they played three one-off benefit shows \u2013 two in [[Cardiff]] at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in [[London]] at Shepherd's Bush Empire.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (2001\u201303)===\n{{Main|Between Order and Model|Seven Ways to Scream Your Name}}\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=because when we started out we didn't think we'd reach the level we've reached.

The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band ''From This Moment On''. Upon hearing the tracks, [[Mighty Atom Records]] approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Between Order and Model]]'' (2002). Before the EP's release, Andi Morris (bass) quit, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band's only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans' screaming role.\n\nIn 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, ''[[Four Ways to Scream Your Name]]'', produced and mixed by [[Colin Richardson]]. In mid-2003, the band secured their first ''[[Kerrang!]]'' award, winning the award for \"Best UK Newcomer\", beating [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], who won in all other nominated categories. Funeral for a Friend's win was largely attributed to their fervent fan base, as the awards winner was decided by public vote online at the official ''Kerrang!'' Web site. In August 2003, Funeral for a Friend opened the Concrete Jungle stage at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].\n\n===Major record label years and international success (2003\u201309)===\n====''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation''====\n[[File:Matt Davies 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright| Matthew Davies performing with Funeral for a Friend in 2004.]]\n{{Main|Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation|Hours (Funeral for a Friend album)}}\nOn 21 August 2003 Funeral for a Friend were awarded a [[Kerrang!

Most of the original dates had been cancelled because Matt Davies had suffered from a bout of laryngitis. Several other shows were scheduled in the UK to complement these rescheduled dates, and the tour culminated in a slot below headliners [[Guns N' Roses]] at the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]].

On 8 May 2007 the band released ''Tales Don't Tell Themselves'' in its entirety for fans to preview via their MySpace page. This album is the first on which Matt plays guitar.

In late February, the band announced the London shows originally scheduled for 15 and 16 April at Shepherd's Bush Empire would instead take place on 20 and 21 May 2016 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town due to structural issues at the original venue which caused many gigs to be cancelled/moved to other dates. Due to Shai Hulud being unable to make the rearranged dates, [[Raging Speedhorn]] and [[Creeper (band)|Creeper]] played as the main support bands on 20 and 21 May respectively. Their final performance was on 21 May.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==== Reunion shows ====\nIn August 2019, Funeral for a Friend announced two special reunion concerts, with the proceedings going to the family of a terminally ill friend of the band.
