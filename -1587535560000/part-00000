His followers are his brother Sathya (Dharma), and supporters (Shobharaj, Sharath Lohitashwa). The people of Krishnanna's constituency elect him as a legislator. Krishna, an ardent follower of Dr. Rajkumar, establishes his own independent political empire, consensus with ideals proposed by Rajkumar. Krishna Prasad's dream is to see his son as a politician revered by people. During this time, he meets with a fatal accident, in which his brother and his followers are also killed, two of them even betraying him.\n\n14 years later, Krishna Prasad's son Bharath ([[Puneeth Rajkumar]]) becomes a daring super-cop in Mumbai. He is on a mission to apprehend mafia don Nayak ([[Kelly Dorjee]]), who is involved in illegal drug trade, extortion and arms trafficking. It is later revealed that Krishna prasad actually survived the accident but ended up in a state of coma. However, this truth is hidden by Krishna Prasad's family from the people. Bharath maintains a low profile to catch Nayak. In an undercover operation in Spain, Bharath gets hold of Nayak's brother, Bablu. Later, it is revealed that corrupt opposition leader Mallanna Goud ([[Doddanna]]), who is also tied up with Nayak, was the mastermind behind Krishna Prasad's accident, and had planned to derail Krishna's political empire as he was opposing his illegal businesses and relation with Nayak.\n\nBharath falls in love with Prasanthi ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]), whom he meets in Spain during his operation. Prasanthi is the daughter of Bharath's higher officer ([[Avinash]]), a cop who reports to the police commissioner (Vinod Alwa) in Bangalore city. When Bharath's dad comes out of the coma, doctors advise his family that Krishna Prasad is at risk if he encounters or hears anything upsetting, disturbing or shocking. Bharath hides the events surrounding his dad's accident & shifts his family to his dad's previously abandoned mansion, which is now being used for filmmaking.\n\nBharath creates a dummy political set-up at this mansion. In the guise of a reality television program, Bharath tricks an aspiring but unsuccessful film actor P. Vibhushan ([[Rangayana Raghu]]), by making him believe that the television show is being sponsored by film star [[V. Ravichandran]], and that Ravichandran wants to offer Padma Vibhushan very high remuneration for his realistic performance in the show. On the other hand, an aspiring actor Kamangi Kidney ([[Sadhu Kokila]]) is also tricked by Bharath. Bharath also tricks Gouda with a real estate business deal, to exploit his criminal nexus. Bharath keeps this drama under wraps from Krishna Prasad, by making Krishna Prasad believe that Bharath is now an M.L.A., revered by people fulfilling his dad's wishes. He also marries his love, Prasanthi, to make his father happy. The rest of the plot reveals the politician-criminal nexus behind Krishna Prasad's accident, the comic misadventures which lead to Krishna Prasad knowing the truth, and Bharath's retaliation over Nayak, Rudresh, and Mallanna's political corruption.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Puneeth Rajkumar]] as Bharat Kumar\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Prashanti\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Krishna Prasad\n* [[Kelly Dorjee]] as Nayak\n* [[Rangayana Raghu]] as P V Bhushan\n* [[Sadhu Kokila]] as Kidney Kamangi\n* [[Tennis Krishna]]\n* [[Thilak Shekar]]\n* [[Jai Jagadish]]\n* [[Shobaraj (Kannada Actor)|Shobaraj]]\n* [[Harsha]]\n* [[Avinash]] as bharat's Higher Officer\n* [[Doddanna]] as Opposition Party Leader Mallana Goud\n* [[Shashikumar]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Om Prakash Rao]]\n* [[Harish Raj]] as Shastri\n* [[Mandya Ramesh]]\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Politician, nayak's supporter\n* [[Sundar Raj|Sunder Raj]]\n* [[Neetu Chandra]] as [[item number]] \"Why Why (Y Y)\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film launched in December 2013 is the first Kannada production of the Telugu company [[14 Reels Entertainment]].

{"title_page": "Okun's law", "text_new": "{{short description|Economic relationship}}\n[[File:Okun's Law 2016.svg|thumb|300x300px|Graph of US quarterly data (not annualized) from 1948 through 2016 estimates a form of the difference version of Okun's law: %Change GDP = 3.2 - 1.8*(Change Unemployment Rate). R^2 of .463. Differences from other results are partly due to the use of quarterly data.]]\nIn [[economics]], '''Okun's law''' (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]], who proposed the relationship in 1962<ref>Prachowny, 1993.</ref>) is an [[Empirical research|empirically]] observed relationship between [[unemployment]] and losses in a country's production.  The \"gap version\" states that for every 1% increase in the [[unemployment rate]], a country's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] will be roughly an additional 2% lower than its [[potential GDP]].  The \"difference version\"<ref>Knotek, 75</ref> describes the relationship between quarterly changes in unemployment and quarterly changes in [[real GDP]].  The stability and usefulness of the law has been disputed.<ref>Knotek, 93</ref>\n\n==Imperfect relationship==\nOkun's law may more accurately be called \"Okun's [[rule of thumb]]\" because it is an approximation based on empirical observation rather than a result derived from theory. Okun's law is approximate because factors other than employment (such as productivity) affect output. In Okun's original statement of his law, '''2'''% increase in output corresponds to a 1% decline in the rate of cyclical unemployment; a 0.5% increase in labor force participation; a 0.5% increase in hours worked per employee; and a 1% increase in output per hours worked ([[labor productivity]]).<ref>Okun, 1962</ref>\n\nOkun's law states that a one-point increase in the cyclical unemployment rate is associated with two percentage points of negative growth in real GDP. The relationship varies depending on the country and time period under consideration.\n\nThe relationship has been tested by regressing GDP or GNP growth on change in the unemployment rate. Martin Prachowny estimated about a 3% decrease in output for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate. However, he argued that the majority of this change in output is actually due to changes in factors other than unemployment, such as capacity utilization and hours worked. Holding these other factors constant reduces the association between unemployment and GDP to around 0.7% for every 1% change in the unemployment rate (Prachowny 1993). The magnitude of the decrease seems to be declining over time in the United States. According to Andrew Abel and [[Ben Bernanke]], estimates based on data from more recent years give about a 2% decrease in output for every 1% increase in unemployment (Abel and Bernanke, 2005).\n\nThere are several reasons why GDP may increase or decrease more rapidly than unemployment decreases or increases:\n\nAs unemployment increases,\n* a reduction in the [[multiplier effect]] created by the circulation of money from employees\n* unemployed persons may drop out of the [[labor force]] (stop seeking work), after which they are no longer counted in unemployment statistics\n* employed workers may work shorter hours\n* labor productivity may decrease, perhaps because employers retain more workers than they need\nOne implication of Okun's law is that an increase in labor productivity or an increase in the size of the labor force can mean that real net output grows without net unemployment rates falling (the phenomenon of \"[[jobless recovery|jobless growth]]\")\n\nOkun's Law is sometimes confused with [[Lucas wedge]].\n\n==Mathematical statements==\nThe gap version of Okun's law may be written (Abel & Bernanke 2005) as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\overline{u})</math>, where\n* <math>Y</math> is actual output\n* <math>\\overline{Y}</math> is potential GDP\n* <math>u</math> is actual unemployment rate\n* <math>\\overline{u}</math> is the natural rate of unemployment\n* <math>c</math> is the factor relating changes in unemployment to changes in output\n\nIn the United States since 1955 or so, the value of c has typically been around 2 or 3, as explained above.\n\nThe gap version of Okun's law, as shown above, is difficult to use in practice because <math>\\overline{Y}</math> and <math>\\overline{u}</math>\ncan only be estimated, not measured. A more commonly used form of Okun's law, known as the difference or growth rate form of\nOkun's law, relates changes in output to changes in unemployment:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} = k - c \\Delta u\\,</math>, where:\n* <math>Y</math> and <math>c</math> are as defined above\n* <math>\\Delta Y</math> is the change in actual output from one year to the next\n* <math>\\Delta u</math> is the change in actual unemployment from one year to the next\n* <math>k</math> is the average annual growth rate of full-employment output\n\nAt the present time in the United States, k is about 3% and c is about 2, so the equation may be written\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} = 0.03 - 2 \\Delta u.\\,</math>\nThe graph at the top of this article illustrates the growth rate form of Okun's law, measured quarterly rather than annually.\n\n==Derivation of the growth rate form==\nWe start with the first form of Okun's law:\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\overline{Y}} = 1-\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\overline{u})</math>\n:<math>\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}}-1 = c(\\overline{u}-u).</math>\nTaking annual differences on both sides, we obtain\n:<math>\\Delta\\left(\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}}\\right) = \\frac{Y + \\Delta Y}{\\overline{Y}+ \\Delta \\overline{Y}} - \\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nPutting both numerators over a common denominator, we obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} \\Delta Y - Y \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}(\\overline{Y} + \\Delta \\overline{Y})}= c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nMultiplying the left hand side by <math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} + \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{Y}</math>, which is approximately equal to 1, we obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} \\Delta Y - Y \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}Y} = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} - \\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}} \\approx c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u)</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}} + c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nWe assume that <math>\\Delta \\overline{u}</math>, the change in the natural rate of unemployment, is approximately equal to 0. We also assume that <math>\\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}}</math>, the growth rate of full-employment output, is approximately equal to its average value, <math>k</math>. So we finally obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} \\approx k - c \\Delta u.</math>\n\n==Usefulness ==\n\nThrough comparisons between actual data and theoretical forecasting, Okun's law proves to be an invaluable{{clarify|date=September 2018}} tool in predicting trends between unemployment and real GDP. However, the accuracy of the data theoretically proved through Okun's law compared to real world numbers proves to be generally inaccurate. This is due to the variances in Okun's coefficient. Many{{who|date=September 2018}} conclude that information proved by Okun's law to be acceptable to a certain degree{{clarify|date=September 2018}}. Also, some findings{{which|date=September 2018}} have concluded that Okun's law tends to have higher rates of accuracy for short-run predictions, rather than long-run predictions. Forecasters{{who|date=September 2018}} have concluded this to be true due to unforeseen market conditions that may affect Okun's coefficient.\n\nAs such, Okun's law is generally acceptable by forecasters as a tool for short-run trend analysis between unemployment and real GDP, rather than being used for long run analysis as well as accurate numerical calculations.\n\nThe San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank determined through the use of empirical data from past recessions in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s that Okun\u2019s law was a useful theory. All recessions showed two common main trends: a counterclockwise loop for both real-time and revised data. The recoveries of the 1990s and 2000s did have smaller and tighter loops.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lucas wedge]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Laurence|last2= Tovar Jalles|first2=Jo\u00e3o| last3= Loungani|first3=Prakash|title=Do Forecasters Believe in Okun\u2019s Law?

R^2 of .463. Differences from other results are partly due to the use of quarterly data.]]\nIn [[economics]], '''Okun's law''' (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]], who proposed the relationship in 1962<ref>Prachowny, 1993.</ref>) is an [[Empirical research|empirically]] observed relationship between [[unemployment]] and losses in a country's production.  The \"gap version\" states that for every 1% increase in the [[unemployment rate]], a country's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] will be roughly an additional 2% lower than its [[potential GDP]].  The \"difference version\"<ref>Knotek, 75</ref> describes the relationship between quarterly changes in unemployment and quarterly changes in [[real GDP]].  The stability and usefulness of the law has been disputed.<ref>Knotek, 93</ref>\n\n==Imperfect relationship==\nOkun's law may more accurately be called \"Okun's [[rule of thumb]]\" because it is an approximation based on empirical observation rather than a result derived from theory. Okun's law is approximate because factors other than employment (such as productivity) affect output. In Okun's original statement of his law, '''2'''% increase in output corresponds to a 1% decline in the rate of cyclical unemployment; a 0.5% increase in labor force participation; a 0.5% increase in hours worked per employee; and a 1% increase in output per hours worked ([[labor productivity]]).<ref>Okun, 1962</ref>\n\nOkun's law states that a one-point increase in the cyclical unemployment rate is associated with two percentage points of negative growth in real GDP. The relationship varies depending on the country and time period under consideration.\n\nThe relationship has been tested by regressing GDP or GNP growth on change in the unemployment rate. Martin Prachowny estimated about a 3% decrease in output for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate. However, he argued that the majority of this change in output is actually due to changes in factors other than unemployment, such as capacity utilization and hours worked. Holding these other factors constant reduces the association between unemployment and GDP to around 0.7% for every 1% change in the unemployment rate (Prachowny 1993). The magnitude of the decrease seems to be declining over time in the United States. According to Andrew Abel and [[Ben Bernanke]], estimates based on data from more recent years give about a 2% decrease in output for every 1% increase in unemployment (Abel and Bernanke, 2005).\n\nThere are several reasons why GDP may increase or decrease more rapidly than unemployment decreases or increases:\n\nAs unemployment increases,\n* a reduction in the [[multiplier effect]] created by the circulation of money from employees\n* unemployed persons may drop out of the [[labor force]] (stop seeking work), after which they are no longer counted in unemployment statistics\n* employed workers may work shorter hours\n* labor productivity may decrease, perhaps because employers retain more workers than they need\nOne implication of Okun's law is that an increase in labor productivity or an increase in the size of the labor force can mean that real net output grows without net unemployment rates falling (the phenomenon of \"[[jobless recovery|jobless growth]]\")\n\nOkun's Law is sometimes confused with [[Lucas wedge]].\n\n==Mathematical statements==\nThe gap version of Okun's law may be written (Abel & Bernanke 2005) as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\overline{u})</math>, where\n* <math>Y</math> is actual output\n* <math>\\overline{Y}</math> is potential GDP\n* <math>u</math> is actual unemployment rate\n* <math>\\overline{u}</math> is the natural rate of unemployment\n* <math>c</math> is the factor relating changes in unemployment to changes in output\n\nIn the United States since 1955 or so, the value of c has typically been around 2 or 3, as explained above.\n\nThe gap version of Okun's law, as shown above, is difficult to use in practice because <math>\\overline{Y}</math> and <math>\\overline{u}</math>\ncan only be estimated, not measured. A more commonly used form of Okun's law, known as the difference or growth rate form of\nOkun's law, relates changes in output to changes in unemployment:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} = k - c \\Delta u\\,</math>, where:\n* <math>Y</math> and <math>c</math> are as defined above\n* <math>\\Delta Y</math> is the change in actual output from one year to the next\n* <math>\\Delta u</math> is the change in actual unemployment from one year to the next\n* <math>k</math> is the average annual growth rate of full-employment output\n\nAt the present time in the United States, k is about 3% and c is about 2, so the equation may be written\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} = 0.03 - 2 \\Delta u.\\,</math>\nThe graph at the top of this article illustrates the growth rate form of Okun's law, measured quarterly rather than annually.\n\n==Derivation of the growth rate form==\nWe start with the first form of Okun's law:\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y}-Y}{\\overline{Y}} = 1-\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(u-\\overline{u})</math>\n:<math>\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}}-1 = c(\\overline{u}-u).</math>\nTaking annual differences on both sides, we obtain\n:<math>\\Delta\\left(\\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}}\\right) = \\frac{Y + \\Delta Y}{\\overline{Y}+ \\Delta \\overline{Y}} - \\frac{Y}{\\overline{Y}} = c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nPutting both numerators over a common denominator, we obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} \\Delta Y - Y \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}(\\overline{Y} + \\Delta \\overline{Y})}= c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nMultiplying the left hand side by <math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} + \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{Y}</math>, which is approximately equal to 1, we obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{Y} \\Delta Y - Y \\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}Y} = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} - \\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}} \\approx c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u)</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}} + c(\\Delta \\overline{u}-\\Delta u).</math>\nWe assume that <math>\\Delta \\overline{u}</math>, the change in the natural rate of unemployment, is approximately equal to 0. We also assume that <math>\\frac{\\Delta \\overline{Y}}{\\overline{Y}}</math>, the growth rate of full-employment output, is approximately equal to its average value, <math>k</math>. So we finally obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta Y}{Y} \\approx k - c \\Delta u.</math>\n\n==Usefulness ==\n\nThrough comparisons between actual data and theoretical forecasting, Okun's law proves to be an invaluable{{clarify|date=September 2018}} tool in predicting trends between unemployment and real GDP. However, the accuracy of the data theoretically proved through Okun's law compared to real world numbers proves to be generally inaccurate. This is due to the variances in Okun's coefficient. Many{{who|date=September 2018}} conclude that information proved by Okun's law to be acceptable to a certain degree{{clarify|date=September 2018}}. Also, some findings{{which|date=September 2018}} have concluded that Okun's law tends to have higher rates of accuracy for short-run predictions, rather than long-run predictions. Forecasters{{who|date=September 2018}} have concluded this to be true due to unforeseen market conditions that may affect Okun's coefficient.\n\nAs such, Okun's law is generally acceptable by forecasters as a tool for short-run trend analysis between unemployment and real GDP, rather than being used for long run analysis as well as accurate numerical calculations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lucas wedge]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Laurence|last2= Tovar Jalles|first2=Jo\u00e3o| last3= Loungani|first3=Prakash|title=Do Forecasters Believe in Okun\u2019s Law?

The name \"Malinois\" is derived from [[Mechelen|Malines]], the [[Belgian French|French]] name for the breed's Flemish city of origin, Mechelen.<ref>Contemporary [[English language|English]] speakers refer to the city by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, Mechelen. The city is located in [[Flanders]], the [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] northern portion of Belgium. Belgium has [[Languages of Belgium|three official languages]].</ref>\n\nThe breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, accelerants (for arson investigation), and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search and rescue missions. The [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] uses Belgian Malinois to guard the grounds of the [[White House]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/white-house-security-mulls-tourist-screens.html?_r=0\n |title = White House May Check Tourists Blocks Away\n |last = Schmidt\n |first = Michael S.\n |date = September 21, 2014\n |website = nytimes.com\n |publisher = The New York Times\n |accessdate = September 22, 2014\n |quote = At all times, there are several muzzled Belgian Malinois on the White House grounds, officials said.\n}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nThe Malinois is a medium-to-large and square-proportioned dog in the [[herding dog|sheepdog]] family. The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the [[German Shepherd]].<ref name=\"akc.org\"/>\n\n===Coat and colour ===\nDue to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colours of pure-bred Malinois are a base colour fawn to mahogany and tan with a [[melanistic mask|black mask]] and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The colour tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.\n\nThe other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours: the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuren)|Tervuren]] is the same colour as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)|Laekenois]] is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)|Groenendael]] (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred; this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds.\n\n===Size===\nMales are about {{convert|61|-|66|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while females are about {{convert|56|-|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=5112 |title=Breed Standard |publisher=The Kennel Club |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Female Malinois average {{convert|20|-|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; males are heavier at {{convert|25|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FCI\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Belgian Malinois 01.jpg|A Malinois with a black mask\nFile:Belgian Malinois Male Puppy.jpg|A four-month-old male Belgian Malinois\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Malinois in ring competition Belgium - Apr 2005.jpg|thumbnail|A Malinois in the ring competing in dog agility]]\n\nWell-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent,<ref name = \"BSDCC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsdcc.org/faq.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Belgian Shepherd Dog Club of Canada  |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref><ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/><ref name = Northern/> friendly,<ref name = BSDCC/> protective,<ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/> alert and hard-working.

The city is located in [[Flanders]], the [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] northern portion of Belgium. Belgium has [[Languages of Belgium|three official languages]].</ref>\n\nThe breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, accelerants (for arson investigation), and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search and rescue missions.

The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the [[German Shepherd]].<ref name=\"akc.org\"/>\n\n===Coat and colour ===\nDue to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colours of pure-bred Malinois are a base colour fawn to mahogany and tan with a [[melanistic mask|black mask]] and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The colour tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.\n\nThe other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours: the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuren)|Tervuren]] is the same colour as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)|Laekenois]] is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)|Groenendael]] (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred; this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds.\n\n===Size===\nMales are about {{convert|61|-|66|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while females are about {{convert|56|-|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=5112 |title=Breed Standard |publisher=The Kennel Club |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Female Malinois average {{convert|20|-|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; males are heavier at {{convert|25|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FCI\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Belgian Malinois 01.jpg|A Malinois with a black mask\nFile:Belgian Malinois Male Puppy.jpg|A four-month-old male Belgian Malinois\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Malinois in ring competition Belgium - Apr 2005.jpg|thumbnail|A Malinois in the ring competing in dog agility]]\n\nWell-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent,<ref name = \"BSDCC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsdcc.org/faq.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Belgian Shepherd Dog Club of Canada  |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref><ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/><ref name = Northern/> friendly,<ref name = BSDCC/> protective,<ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/> alert and hard-working. Belgian Malinois exhibit energy levels that are among the highest of all dog breeds. A typical Malinois will have puppy-like energy until the age of three, though it is not uncommon for them to exhibit this energy level until the age of five. Many have excessively high [[prey drive]]. Some may be excessively exuberant or playful, especially when young.<ref name = BSDCC/><ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/>\n\nThey can be destructive or develop neurotic behaviours if not provided enough stimulation and exercise.

From 1016 to 1035, [[Cnut the Great]] ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his [[North Sea Empire]], together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son [[Harold Harefoot]], until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut's sons, [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacnut]], took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of [[Edward the Confessor]].\n\nEdward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, [[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]], took the throne. In the autumn of that same year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], in [[Yorkshire]]. Then, three weeks later, [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] defeated Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], and in December he accepted the submission of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.\n\n==Danish\u2013Norwegian conflict in the North Sea==\nIn the 11th century, when King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] had freed Norway from Cnut the Great, the terms of the peace treaty provided that the first of the two kings Magnus (Norway) and Harthacnut (Denmark) to die would leave their dominion as an inheritance to the other. When Edward the Confessor ascended the throne of a united Dano-Saxon England, a Norse army was raised from every Norwegian colony in the British Isles and attacked Edward's England in support of Magnus', and after his death, his brother Harald Hardrada's, claim to the English throne. On the accession of [[Harold Godwinson]] after the death of Edward the Confessor, Hardrada invaded Northumbria with the support of Harold's brother [[Tostig Godwinson]], and was defeated at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], three weeks before William I's victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Chronology==\n'''800''' \u2212 Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.\n\n'''865''' \u2212 Danish raiders first begin to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they move north and attack Northumbria, which is in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper \u00c6lla. The Danes use the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sack and burn.\n\n'''867''' \u2212 Following the loss of York, Osberht and \u00c6lla form an alliance against the Danes. They launch a counter-attack, but the Danes kill both Osberht and \u00c6lla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King \u00c6thelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, march against the Danes, who are positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but are unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia cedes Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.\n\n'''868''' \u2212 Danes capture [[Nottingham]]\n\n'''869''' \u2212 Ivar the Boneless returns and demands tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.\n\n'''870''' \u2212 King Edmund refuses Ivar's demand.  Ivar defeats and captures Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King \u00c6thelred and Alfred attack the Danes at Reading, but are repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursue them.\n\n'''871''' \u2212 On 7 January, \u00c6thelred and Alfred make their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). \u00c6thelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred leads the army into battle. \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeat the Danes, who count among their losses five [[earl|jarls]] (nobles). The Danes retreat and set up fortifications at [[Old Basing|Basing]] ([[Basingstoke]]) in Hampshire, a mere {{convert|14|mi|km}} from Reading. \u00c6thelred attacks the Danish fortifications and is routed. The Danes follow up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\n\nKing \u00c6thelred dies on 23 April 871 and Alfred takes the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrates on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He is moderately successful in this endeavour and is able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army is on the verge of collapse. Alfred responds by paying off the Danes in order for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turn north and attack Mercia, which they finish off in short order, and capture London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fights in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he flees to Europe. During Ivar's campaign against Mercia he dies and is succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeats Burgred and places a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now control East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.\n\n'''875''' \u2212 The Danes settle in [[Dorset]], well inside of Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly makes peace with them.\n\n'''876''' \u2212 The Danes break the peace when they capture the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.\n\n'''877''' \u2212 Alfred lays in a siege, while the Danes wait for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encounter a storm and lose more than 100 ships, and the Danes are forced to return to East Mercia in the north.\n\n'''878''' \u2212 In January, Guthrum leads an attack against Wessex that seeks to capture Alfred while he winters in Chippenham. Another Danish army [[Viking expansion#Wales|landed in south Wales]] arrives and moves south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum's forces. However, they stop during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex [[ealdorman]] named [[Odda, Ealdorman of Devon|Odda]]. The Saxons, led by Odda, attack the Danes while they sleep and defeat their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred is forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred is able to gather an army and attacks Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes are defeated and retreat to Chippenham, where the English pursue and lay siege to Guthrum's forces. The Danes are unable to hold out without relief and soon surrender. Alfred demands as a term of the surrender that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agrees to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum is true to his word and settles in East Anglia, at least for a while.\n\n'''884''' \u2212 Guthrum attacks Kent, but is defeated by the English. This leads to the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, which establishes the boundaries of the Danelaw and allows for Danish self-rule in the region.<ref name=attenbborough96>{{Cite book|editor-last=Attenborough|editor-first=F.L.

These strongholds became known as the ''Five Boroughs''. ''Borough'' derives from the Old English word ''burh'' ([[cognate]] with German ''Burg'', meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.\n\n==Legal concepts==\nThe Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in ''[[weregild|wergild]]''.\n\nMany of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking ''wapentake'', the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]. The use of the execution site and cemetery at [[Walkington Wold Burials|Walkington Wold]] in east Yorkshire suggests a continuity of judicial practice.<ref>J.L. Buckberry & D.M.

Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, [[Ingleby, Derbyshire|Ingleby]], [[Derbyshire]].\n\nArchaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.\n\n[[Thynghowe]] was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in [[Sherwood Forest]], in Nottinghamshire. The word \"howe\" often indicates a prehistoric [[burial mound]].

From 1016 to 1035, [[Cnut the Great]] ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his [[North Sea Empire]], together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son [[Harold Harefoot]], until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut's sons, [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacnut]], took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of [[Edward the Confessor]].\n\nEdward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, [[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]], took the throne. In the autumn of that same year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], in [[Yorkshire]]. Then, three weeks later, [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] defeated Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], and in December he accepted the submission of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.\n\n==Danish\u2013Norwegian conflict in the North Sea==\nIn the 11th century, when King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] had freed Norway from Cnut the Great, the terms of the peace treaty provided that the first of the two kings Magnus (Norway) and Harthacnut (Denmark) to die would leave their dominion as an inheritance to the other. When Edward the Confessor ascended the throne of a united Dano-Saxon England, a Norse army was raised from every Norwegian colony in the British Isles and attacked Edward's England in support of Magnus', and after his death, his brother Harald Hardrada's, claim to the English throne. On the accession of [[Harold Godwinson]] after the death of Edward the Confessor, Hardrada invaded Northumbria with the support of Harold's brother [[Tostig Godwinson]], and was defeated at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], three weeks before William I's victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Chronology==\n'''800''' \u2212 Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.\n\n'''865''' \u2212 Danish raiders first begin to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they move north and attack Northumbria, which is in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper \u00c6lla. The Danes use the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sack and burn.\n\n'''867''' \u2212 Following the loss of York, Osberht and \u00c6lla form an alliance against the Danes. They launch a counter-attack, but the Danes kill both Osberht and \u00c6lla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King \u00c6thelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, march against the Danes, who are positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but are unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia cedes Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.\n\n'''868''' \u2212 Danes capture [[Nottingham]]\n\n'''869''' \u2212 Ivar the Boneless returns and demands tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.\n\n'''870''' \u2212 King Edmund refuses Ivar's demand.  Ivar defeats and captures Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King \u00c6thelred and Alfred attack the Danes at Reading, but are repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursue them.\n\n'''871''' \u2212 On 7 January, \u00c6thelred and Alfred make their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). \u00c6thelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred leads the army into battle. \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeat the Danes, who count among their losses five [[earl|jarls]] (nobles). The Danes retreat and set up fortifications at [[Old Basing|Basing]] ([[Basingstoke]]) in Hampshire, a mere {{convert|14|mi|km}} from Reading. \u00c6thelred attacks the Danish fortifications and is routed. The Danes follow up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\n\nKing \u00c6thelred dies on 23 April 871 and Alfred takes the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrates on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He is moderately successful in this endeavour and is able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army is on the verge of collapse. Alfred responds by paying off the Danes in order for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turn north and attack Mercia, which they finish off in short order, and capture London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fights in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he flees to Europe. During Ivar's campaign against Mercia he dies and is succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeats Burgred and places a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now control East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.\n\n'''875''' \u2212 The Danes settle in [[Dorset]], well inside of Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly makes peace with them.\n\n'''876''' \u2212 The Danes break the peace when they capture the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.\n\n'''877''' \u2212 Alfred lays in a siege, while the Danes wait for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encounter a storm and lose more than 100 ships, and the Danes are forced to return to East Mercia in the north.\n\n'''878''' \u2212 In January, Guthrum leads an attack against Wessex that seeks to capture Alfred while he winters in Chippenham. Another Danish army [[Viking expansion#Wales|landed in south Wales]] arrives and moves south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum's forces. However, they stop during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex [[ealdorman]] named [[Odda, Ealdorman of Devon|Odda]]. The Saxons, led by Odda, attack the Danes while they sleep and defeat their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred is forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred is able to gather an army and attacks Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes are defeated and retreat to Chippenham, where the English pursue and lay siege to Guthrum's forces. The Danes are unable to hold out without relief and soon surrender. Alfred demands as a term of the surrender that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agrees to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum is true to his word and settles in East Anglia, at least for a while.\n\n'''884''' \u2212 Guthrum attacks Kent, but is defeated by the English. This leads to the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, which establishes the boundaries of the Danelaw and allows for Danish self-rule in the region.<ref name=attenbborough96>{{Cite book|editor-last=Attenborough|editor-first=F.L.

''Borough'' derives from the Old English word ''burh'' ([[cognate]] with German ''Burg'', meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.\n\n==Legal concepts==\nThe Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in ''[[weregild|wergild]]''.\n\nMany of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking ''wapentake'', the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]. The use of the execution site and cemetery at [[Walkington Wold Burials|Walkington Wold]] in east Yorkshire suggests a continuity of judicial practice.<ref>J.L. Buckberry & D.M. Hadley, \"An Anglo-Saxon Execution Cemetery at Walkington Wold, Yorkshire\", ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 26(3) 2007, 325</ref>\n\nUnder the Danelaw, between 30% and 50% of the population in the countryside had the legal status of '[[sokeman]]', occupying an intermediate position between the [[free tenant]]s and the [[Villein (feudal)|bond tenants]].<ref>Emma Day (2011), [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/239350/Emma_Day_Thesis.pdf;sequence=1 SOKEMEN AND FREEMEN IN LATE ANGLO-SAXON EAST ANGLIA IN COMPARATIVE CONTEXT.

A sokeman was a free man within the lord's ''soke'', or jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.mercedesrochelle.com/wordpress/?p=1062 What is Sac and Soke in Anglo-Saxon England?] (2015)</ref>\n\nAccording to many scholars, \"... the Danelaw was an especially \u2018free\u2019 area of Britain because the rank and file of the Danish armies, from whom sokemen were descended, had settled in the area and imported their own social system.\"<ref>Emma Day (2011), [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/239350/Emma_Day_Thesis.pdf;sequence=1 SOKEMEN AND FREEMEN IN LATE ANGLO-SAXON EAST ANGLIA IN COMPARATIVE CONTEXT.

There seems to be a remarkable number of ''Kirby/Kirkby'' names, some with remains of Anglo-Saxon building<ref>Taylor, H.M. & Taylor, Joan, ''Anglo-Saxon Architecture''. Cambridge, 1965.</ref> indicating both a Norse origin and early church building.<ref>introduction, Biddulph, Joseph ''Old Danish of the Old Danelaw''.

The contact between these languages in the Danelaw caused the incorporation of many Norse words into the [[English language]], including the word [[law]] itself, ''sky'' and ''window,'' and the [[Grammatical person|third person]] [[pronoun]]s ''they'', ''them'' and ''their''.<ref>Henry Loyn,'' The Vikings in Britain'' (Cambridge: Blackwell Publishers, 1995), 85.</ref> Many Old Norse words still survive in the dialects of Northern England.<ref>Joan Beal, \"English Dialects in the North of England: Morphology and Syntax,\" in ''A Handbook of Varieties of English'' vol. 2, ed.

However, Stamford failed to gain such status\u2014perhaps because of the nearby autonomous territory of [[Rutland]].\n\n==Genetic heritage==\n{{See also|Genetic history of the British Isles|Scandinavian migration to the United Kingdom}}\nIn 2000, the [[BBC]] commissioned a genetic survey of the British Isles by a team from [[University College London]] led by Professor David Goldstein for its programme '[[Blood of the Vikings]]'. It concluded that Norse invaders settled sporadically throughout the British Isles with a particular concentration in certain areas, such as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1689955.stm |title=ENGLAND &#124; Viking blood still flowing |work=BBC News |date=2001-12-03 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> In this finding, the Vikings refers to Norwegian Vikings only, as the study did not set out to genetically distinguish descendants of Danish Vikings from descendants of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlers. That was decided on the basis that the latter two groups originated from areas that overlap each other on the continental North Sea coast (ranging from the [[Jutland Peninsula]] to [[Belgium]]) and were therefore deemed inconvenient or difficult to genetically distinguish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geneticarchaeology.com/research/Blood_Of_The_Vikings.asp |title=Blood of the Vikings |work=Genetic Archaeology |year=2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606235749/http://www.geneticarchaeology.com/research/Blood_Of_The_Vikings.asp |archive-date=2014-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A further genetic study in 2015 found some evidence that, after Germanic migrants began settling (400s CE), their communities had lived alongside indigenous 'British' ones, and not intermingled for the first hundred years before going on to become a homogenous genetic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31905764|title=DNA study: Celts not a single group|first=Pallab|last=Ghosh|date=18 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This may therefore have been a similar process during the Scandinavian settlement of the Danelaw. The same study could not detect Viking genes from the raiding period.\n\n==Archaeology==\nMajor archaeological sites that bear testimony to the Danelaw are few. The most famous is the site at York. Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, [[Ingleby, Derbyshire|Ingleby]], [[Derbyshire]].\n\nArchaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.\n\n[[Thynghowe]] was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in [[Sherwood Forest]], in Nottinghamshire. The word \"howe\" often indicates a prehistoric [[burial mound]]. Howe is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''Haugr'' meaning mound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/guide-to-scandinavian-origins-of-place-names.pdf |first=Anke-Beate |last=Stahl |title=Guide to Scandinavian origins of place names in Britain |work=[[Ordnance Survey]] |date=May 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> The site's rediscovery was made by Lynda Mallett, Stuart Reddish and John Wood. The site had vanished from modern maps and was essentially lost to history until the local history enthusiasts made their discoveries. Experts think the rediscovered site, which lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the [[Birklands]] in Sherwood Forest, may also yield clues as to the boundary of the ancient [[Anglo Saxon]] kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. [[English Heritage]] recently inspected the site and believes it is a national rarity.

Unlike the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which was initially only available through [[shareware]] and mail order, ''Doom II'' was sold in stores.

There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, ''Doom II's'' levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.\n\nRather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first ''Doom'', gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of ''Doom''), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of ''Doom'' available in ''[[The Ultimate Doom]]'', the [[retail]] re-release of the original ''Doom''). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.\n\n''Doom II'' doubled the number of non-[[Boss (video games)|boss]] monster types and started using bosses from the original ''Doom'' as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the double-barreled shotgun (called the Super Shotgun in the game), and a new power-up, the Megasphere.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Doom''{{'}}s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in ''Doom II'', including \"out of the box\" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in [[deathmatch]]-style combat. There was also [[LAN|Local area network]] (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original ''Doom''. As with the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service [[DWANGO]] or with once-popular programs like [[Kali (software)|Kali]] and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, ''Doom II'' can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party [[Source port|source ports]] such as ''[[Odamex]]'',<ref name=\"OnlineDoom2\"/> ''[[Zandronum]]'',<ref name=\"Zandronum\"/>\n''[[ZDaemon]]'',<ref name=\"ZDaemon\"/> and are still popular today.<ref name=\"WyeSoft\"/> The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] port of ''Doom II'' supports online multiplayer via [[Xbox Live]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and [[Hell]].\n \nImmediately following the events in ''Doom'', the player once again assumes the role of [[Doomguy|an unnamed space marine]]. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, The demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/><ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/>\n\nThe humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/> The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.<ref name=\"timbrastowguide\"/>\n\nJust as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in [[space orbit|orbit]], who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.\n\nAfter fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest [[demon]] he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin ([[Baphomet]]). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed.\n\nPut the mans text about helping rebuild earth back.\n\n==Development==\nMost of the levels were designed by [[Sandy Petersen]],<ref name=\"JRShoot\"/> with [[American McGee]] playing a significant role as well. The final level, ''Icon of Sin'', contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] where two of the artists put the disembodied head of [[John Romero]] as the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be hit by rockets three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying \"To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero\", putting it through various [[Audio filter|filters]] to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the \"demonic chant\" spoken by the head upon spotting the player.<ref name=\"JRInterview\"/><ref name=\"IconSin\"/> The photo that was scanned for the \"John Romero's head\"-sprite was from a [[Businessweek]] photo shot in 1994.<ref name=\"JRBusWeek\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized.<ref name=\"3DO-Doom2\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2Preview\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2PreviewII\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was first released on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the [[Doomsday rule]] and exactly ten months after the original), in both North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DoomsdayRule\"/><ref name=\"DoomII-20Years\"/><ref name=\"DoomBlue\"/>\n\n==Expansions==\n===''Master Levels for Doom II''===\n''Master Levels for Doom II'' is an official [[expansion pack]] for ''Doom II'' which was released on December 26, 1995 by [[id Software]]. The CD contains 20 [[Doom modding|WAD]] files created by various authors under contract. There was also an additional bonus called ''Maximum Doom'' consisting of 3,000 [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] levels.<ref name=\"MaxDoom\"/>\n\n===''No Rest for the Living''===\n''No Rest for the Living'' is the title of an expansion pack developed by [[Nerve Software]] for the release of ''Doom II'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the Xbox 360. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 ''Doom II'' release from ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'', as part of ''Doom Classic Complete'' for the [[PlayStation Network]], and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 [[Unity engine]] port of ''Doom II''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Sales===\nAccording to [[David Kushner]] in ''[[Masters of Doom]]'', id Software shipped 600,000 units of ''Doom II'' to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months.<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/> Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves.<ref name=\"Pioneer-GTInteractive\"/> The game was the United States' highest-selling computer title of 1994.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone.<ref name=\"slow\"/>\n\nIn the United States, ''Doom II'' was the third-best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, with 1.55 million units sold during that period.<ref name=\"alltimesales\"/> Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million. Of the latter figure, Kushner wrote that \"30 percent [...] came from Germany\u2014a country that had banned the game from its shelves.\"<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/>\n\n===Critical reviews===\n{{Video game reviews\n | MC = PC: 83/100<ref name=\"MC\"/><br />GBA: 77/100<ref name=\"MC-GBA\"/><br />X360: 77/100<ref name=\"MC-X360\"/>\n | Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allgame-DM2\"/>\n | NGen = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NG\"/>\n | PCPP = 3/10 <small>(Master Levels)</small><ref name=\"MasterLevels\"/>\n | GSpot = 8.5 /10 <small>(PC)</small><ref name=Spot>{{cite web |last=Gamespot Staff |date=May 1, 1996 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-ii-review/1900-2539987/ |title=Doom II Review (GameSpot)|publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n | GSpy = {{rating|4.5|5}} <small>(GBA)</small><ref name=Spy>{{cite web |last=Fryman|first=Avi |date=October 26, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030134428/http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/doom-ii/547320p1.html |archive-date=October 3, 2004|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/doom-ii/547320p1.html|title=GameSpy: Doom II|publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n | rev1 = ''[[MacUser]]''\n | rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"macuser\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev2Score = A<ref name=ET>{{cite web |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris|date=October 28, 1994 |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/28/pc-game-review-doom-ii-hell-earth/ |title=PC Game Review: 'Doom II: Hell on Earth'|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe reception of ''Doom II'' was positive, with reviewers saying it refined everything that made the original ''Doom'' good.<ref name=\"GR-DM2\"/> According to ''Dragon'', \"if mindless but intense carnage is what you want, you'll get your money's worth.

Unlike the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which was initially only available through [[shareware]] and mail order, ''Doom II'' was sold in stores. ''Master Levels for Doom II'', an [[expansion pack]] with 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995.<ref name=\"ml-faq\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was [[Video game port|ported]] to the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002, on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in 2010,<ref name=\"Shacknews-DM2\"/><ref name=\"XboxLive-DM2\"/> and on [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in 2019.<ref name=\"OriginalDoom\"/> The release of the ''Doom'' [[Open source|source code]] has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including the Apple [[iPhone]] and several other types of cell phones.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:DOOM2 ingame 1.png|thumb|left|The [[double-barreled shotgun]] in use]]\n\n''Doom II'' was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, ''Doom II's'' levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.\n\nRather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first ''Doom'', gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of ''Doom''), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of ''Doom'' available in ''[[The Ultimate Doom]]'', the [[retail]] re-release of the original ''Doom''). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.\n\n''Doom II'' doubled the number of non-[[Boss (video games)|boss]] monster types and started using bosses from the original ''Doom'' as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the double-barreled shotgun (called the Super Shotgun in the game), and a new power-up, the Megasphere.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Doom''{{'}}s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in ''Doom II'', including \"out of the box\" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in [[deathmatch]]-style combat. There was also [[LAN|Local area network]] (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original ''Doom''. As with the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service [[DWANGO]] or with once-popular programs like [[Kali (software)|Kali]] and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, ''Doom II'' can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party [[Source port|source ports]] such as ''[[Odamex]]'',<ref name=\"OnlineDoom2\"/> ''[[Zandronum]]'',<ref name=\"Zandronum\"/>\n''[[ZDaemon]]'',<ref name=\"ZDaemon\"/> and are still popular today.<ref name=\"WyeSoft\"/> The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] port of ''Doom II'' supports online multiplayer via [[Xbox Live]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and [[Hell]].\n \nImmediately following the events in ''Doom'', the player once again assumes the role of [[Doomguy|an unnamed space marine]]. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, The demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/><ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/>\n\nThe humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/> The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.<ref name=\"timbrastowguide\"/>\n\nJust as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in [[space orbit|orbit]], who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.\n\nAfter fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest [[demon]] he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin ([[Baphomet]]). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed.\n\n==Development==\nMost of the levels were designed by [[Sandy Petersen]],<ref name=\"JRShoot\"/> with [[American McGee]] playing a significant role as well. The final level, ''Icon of Sin'', contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] where two of the artists put the disembodied head of [[John Romero]] as the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be hit by rockets three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying \"To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero\", putting it through various [[Audio filter|filters]] to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the \"demonic chant\" spoken by the head upon spotting the player.<ref name=\"JRInterview\"/><ref name=\"IconSin\"/> The photo that was scanned for the \"John Romero's head\"-sprite was from a [[Businessweek]] photo shot in 1994.<ref name=\"JRBusWeek\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized.<ref name=\"3DO-Doom2\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2Preview\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2PreviewII\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was first released on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the [[Doomsday rule]] and exactly ten months after the original), in both North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DoomsdayRule\"/><ref name=\"DoomII-20Years\"/><ref name=\"DoomBlue\"/>\n\n==Expansions==\n===''Master Levels for Doom II''===\n''Master Levels for Doom II'' is an official [[expansion pack]] for ''Doom II'' which was released on December 26, 1995 by [[id Software]]. The CD contains 20 [[Doom modding|WAD]] files created by various authors under contract. There was also an additional bonus called ''Maximum Doom'' consisting of 3,000 [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] levels.<ref name=\"MaxDoom\"/>\n\n===''No Rest for the Living''===\n''No Rest for the Living'' is the title of an expansion pack developed by [[Nerve Software]] for the release of ''Doom II'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the Xbox 360. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 ''Doom II'' release from ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'', as part of ''Doom Classic Complete'' for the [[PlayStation Network]], and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 [[Unity engine]] port of ''Doom II''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Sales===\nAccording to [[David Kushner]] in ''[[Masters of Doom]]'', id Software shipped 600,000 units of ''Doom II'' to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months.<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/> Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves.<ref name=\"Pioneer-GTInteractive\"/> The game was the United States' highest-selling computer title of 1994.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone.<ref name=\"slow\"/>\n\nIn the United States, ''Doom II'' was the third-best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, with 1.55 million units sold during that period.<ref name=\"alltimesales\"/> Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million.

Before, he held various positions at the [[University of Graz]] (1973\u20131975), [[University of Vienna]] (1975\u20131992), [[Saarland University|University of Saarland]] (1992\u20132003), and University of Malaya (2012-2015), and worked at the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) (1985\u20131987), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) (1988\u20131990), and the [[World Bank]] (1997\u20132011). At the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C., he served as Sector Director (1997\u20132009), Research Director (2009\u20132011), and acting Senior Vice-President (2002\u20132003). From 1983 to 2005, he directed the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Economic Policy Analyses (Vienna). He currently holds an honorary professorship at the [[University of New South Wales]] (Sydney). He is a Research Fellow at [[Institute for the Study of Labor|IZA]] (a German labor market think tank in Bonn) and [[CESifo Economic Studies|CESifo]] (Munich). In 2014 he was elected Full Member (Fellow) of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. He consults for governments, international organizations, and research institutions.\n\nHolzmann holds various editorial and advisory positions, including: Associate Editor\u2012 ''Journal of the Economics of Ageing''; Associate Editor, Economics \u2013 ''E-journal''; Member \u2013 Editorial and Advisory Board of ''International Journal of Social Security and Workers Compensation'' (Australia); Member \u2013 Editorial Board of ''Journal of Public Policy''; Member \u2013 Council of Advisors, Population Europe; and Distinguished Associate \u2013 Atlantic International Economic Society. He has published 37 books and over 150 articles on social, fiscal, and financial policy issues. \n\n== Career highlights ==\n\nHolzmann held guest professorships at, ''inter alia'', [[Hitotsubashi University]] (Tokyo), [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile|La Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]] (Santiago), and [[Southwestern University of Finance and Economics]] (Chengdu); he lectured, ''inter alia'', at [[Harvard University]]  (Boston) and [[Oxford University]] (Oxford, UK); and he consulted for Austria's central bank [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank]], the Commission of the European Union, the [[Council of Europe]], [[Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GTZ, now GIZ), the [[International Labour Organization]], the IMF, the [[International Social Security Association]] (ISSA), the OECD, and the World Bank.\n\nWhile on leave from the University of Vienna, Holzmann joined OECD\u2019s Social Affairs Team in 1985 to establish its pension data base and wrote the policy think piece on \"Reforming Public Pensions\" (Holzmann 1988). Upon his return to Vienna in 1987, he was invited to join the IMF\u2019s Fiscal Affairs Department. Hoping to leave behind pensions and return to broader fiscal and macroeconomic policy issues and looking forward to working on developing countries, he was instead thrown back into pension work on fiscal issues in Hungary and Poland before and during their transformation. He was involved in rethinking their social programs as those countries acknowledged the need to focus there as well as on their moves from centrally planned to [[Market economy|market economies]]. This engagement led to Holzmann\u2019s subsequent analytical and policy work on pensions and other social programs across essentially all Central and East European reform countries (Holzmann 1997b).\n\nIn 1992 the University of Saarland offered Holzmann a full professorship and a position as chair of the Institute of International Economic Relations as well as managing director of the Economic Section of the European Institute (a post-graduate institution with teaching staff that included [[Paul De Grauwe|Paul de Grauwe]] and [[European Commission]] staff and officials). This allowed him to return to his initial intellectual interest (European monetary integration), to work on Western European integration, and to teach authoritatively on Eastern European transitions. The 1990s were the heyday of discussing the [[Maastricht treaty]] implementation and preparing for introduction of the Euro; the [[European Institute]] offered intellectual stimulus and corrections to the debate. Yet Holzmann\u2019s warning about the construction issues of the [[Euro]] and the likely consequences were little heard (Holzmann, Herve, and Demmel 1996; Demmel, Herve, and Holzmann 1999).\n\nHolzmann was recruited to join the World Bank in 1997 under the leadership of [[James Wolfensohn]], the just-appointed president. Out of 232 international candidates, he was selected to head the newly established Social Protection and Labor Sector. Given the University of Saarland\u2019s budget cuts as part of a further bailout of the state of Saarland, Holzmann had strong incentives to once again leave academia and return to Washington, D.C. He was motivated by the intellectual and managerial challenges of this new World Bank sector and derived great satisfaction from successfully addressing them. His notable achievements there include:\n* \tA widely applauded strategy for this new sector and the development of its intellectual underpinnings, which moved social protection from being a synonym for mere hand-outs (often resented) to a concept of [[social risk management]] (SRM) that provides a strong economic and social rationale for such interventions given the many risks to which the poor are exposed (Holzmann and Jorgensen 1999, 2001). The implications of SRM were detailed in a sector strategy (World Bank 2001), became a foundation of the World Bank\u2019s ''World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty'', and were embraced by the development community. As such, the concept became a cornerstone for economic and social development across the globe, and SRM is now used as a conceptual framework for social programs by both developing and highly developed countries. \n* \tThe [[knowledge management]] approach for the sector and the development of analytical and operational products to help governments design and implement better policies in the area of social protection and labor. Internationally recognized products include: PROST, the [http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/01/18278193/modeling-pension-reform-world-banks-pension-reform-options-simulation-toolkit Pension Reform Options Simulation Tool] used by almost 100 countries across the world; analytical products published in the [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/13084 Social Protection and Labor Discussion Paper Series]; and creation of three core courses on pensions, labor and employment, and social assistance. The pension core course started as a collaboration with Harvard University and was co-directed with [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and [[Laurence Kotlikoff|Larry Kotlikoff]]. Holzmann is recognized worldwide for his research on pensions, including on topics such as: the impact of moving from unfunded to funded provisions on economic outcomes (Holzmann 1997a, 1999); the measurement of implicit pension liabilities (Holzmann, Palacios, and Zviniene 2001, 2004; Holzmann 2014b); and pension reform issues.\n*       Development of a pension reform strategy for World Bank client countries that offered a new vision while taking into consideration political, economic, and administrative constraints (Holzmann and Stiglitz 2001; Holzmann and Hinz 2005). Holzmann\u2019s engaged debates with [[Joseph Stiglitz|Joe Stiglitz]] (then World Bank Chief Economist and Nobel Laureate in Economics in 2001, the year their joint book was published) led to a sharpening of arguments on both sides of the debate over whether or not to fund pensions. Holzmann\u2019s 2005 publication with Hinz was critically reviewed by [[Peter Diamond]], another Nobel Laureate in Economics. As part of this intellectual exercise Holzmann, like Peter Diamond and Nick Barr, became a main driving force for analyzing the design, strengthening the implementation, and covering the knowledge gaps of Notional or Non-financial [[Defined contribution plan|Defined Contribution]] (NDC) schemes such as those introduced in Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Sweden (Holzmann and Palmer 2006; Holzmann, Palmer, and Robalino 2012, 2013). Holzmann was a strong proponent of NDCs as the core element of a pan-European pension approach (Holzmann 2006, 2015b). In continuation of the NDC policy research work, he is now leading an editorial team to publish the contents of the October 2017 Rome 3rd NDC conference. These two volumes (37 chapters) should be ready in 2019 (Holzmann, Palmer, Palacios, and Sacchi, in preparation).\n* \tThe rekindling of interest in labor market issues in developing countries at the World Bank and beyond, including development of strategies and knowledge products and creation with IZA of a [http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/research/ra7/index joint program on \"Employment and Development\"] in 2006. Now the largest research network on the topic, Holzmann co-directed this program with Klaus Zimmermann until 2011. His own research contributions to the employment debate from a social protection angle comprise, ''inter alia'': the first comprehensive publication on severance pay, an effort that took eight years (Holzmann and Vodpivec 2012); the role of the zero pillar in coverage expansion (Holzmann, Robalino, and Takayama 2009); and the role of matching contributions for coverage extensions (Hinz, Holzmann, Takayama, and Tuesta 2013). \n* \tThe introduction of promising new areas into the development discourse, such as [[financial literacy]] and education, migration, and [[portability (social security)|portability]] of social benefits. The exploration of new ideas in social protection and labor was often financed by World Bank trust funds generously provided by various countries\u2019 development agencies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Germany, Italy, Korea, Norway, Switzerland, and the Russian Federation); Holzmann excelled in soliciting their interest and generosity. \n* On financial literacy and education, Holzmann initiated and guided a large research team whose work offered an analytically convincing alternative to traditional conceptualization and measurement proposals (Holzmann 2011; Holzmann, Mulaj, and Perotti 2013). He initiated and led research on how to make migration a win-win-win situation for migrant-sending and -receiving countries and migrants (Holzmann and Muenz 2004; Holzmann and Pouget 2010; Holzmann 2018). Lastly, Holzmann initiated and is still the leader of economic research on the international portability of social benefits (Holzmann, Koettl, and Chernetsky 2006; Holzmann and Koettl 2015; Holzmann 2015c; Holzmann 2016).\n* \tThe intellectually innovating and operationally relevant and client-oriented work by the Social Protection and Labor Sector and its staff, which was recognized by two World Bank internal (but independent) evaluation bodies: in 2003, this sector was the only one to receive a \"highly satisfactory\" rating among 16 sectors, an outstanding rank retained in 2011 and shared with only two other World Bank sectors.\n\nSince retiring from the World Bank in 2011 and returning to Alpine Austria, Holzmann has held the chair for Old-Age Financial Protection at the University of Malaya (Kuala Lumpur) (2012\u20132015) and continues to serve the University\u2019s Social Security Research Centre in an honorary position. His impact includes: initiation of and work on a database of 30,000 contributors to the [[Employees Provident Fund (Malaysia)|Employees Provident Fund]] \u2013 Malaysia\u2019s central provident fund \u2012 that is available to researchers, the first of its kind in Asia; and a think piece on issues and a reform vision for the Employees Provident Fund (Holzmann 2014a). Since 2012 he has held an honorary position at CEPAR \u2013 the Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research \u2013 at the University of New South Wales. In this capacity he initiated a joint CEPAR-CESifo project on a largely under-researched topic, namely taxation of public and private pensions in general and taxation of internationally portable pensions in particular. Two successful workshops in Sydney (2014) and [http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/events/Archive/conferences/2015/09/2015-09-03-tag15-Holzmann.html Munich (2015)] with many world-class experts offered the material for a book published recently by MIT Press (Holzmann and Piggott 2018). With his initiated work on the taxation of internationally portable pensions, Holzmann hopes to attract the attention of economists to offer conceptual guidance for policy makers in the design and reform of income taxes and the rethinking of double taxation treaties (Holzmann 2015a; Genser and Holzmann 2018).\n\nIn 2014 Holzmann became a member of the Forum of Experts of the BBVA Pension Institute in Madrid, where he conducts research with academic colleagues from Spain and Portugal on policy-relevant but underexplored topics such as: the role of demography for pension systems and reforms (e.g., Ayuso, Bravo, and Holzmann 2014, 2015); the importance of heterogeneity in longevity and the implication for pension scheme redesign (Ayuso, Bravo, and Holzmann 2017a, 2017b); and the importance of getting the estimates for life expectancy right (Ayuso, Bravo, and Holzmann 2018). The current project under implementation investigates the relevance of the lifecycle savings model for key tiers of the population.\n\n== Selected publications (referenced above) == \nAyuso, M., J.
