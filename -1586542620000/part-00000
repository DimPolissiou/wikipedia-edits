It also contains the [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[blood vessel]]s. The [[blood vessel]]s in the [[dermis]] provide nourishment and waste removal from its own [[cell (biology)|cells]] as well as for the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].\n\nThe [[dermis]] is tightly connected to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] through a [[basement membrane]] and is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.\n\n====Papillary region====\nThe papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'' that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The papillae provide the [[dermis]] with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular [[connective tissue]] and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagen]]ous, [[Elastic fibers|elastic]], and [[Reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the [[dermis]] its properties of [[strength of materials|strength]], [[extensibility]], and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].\nAlso located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Subcutaneous tissue===\n{{main|Subcutaneous tissue}}\n\nThe [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also hypodermis)  is not part of the skin, and lies below the [[dermis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying [[bone]] and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. It consists of loose [[connective tissue]] and [[elastin]]. The main [[cell (biology)|cell]] types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (the subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of [[body fat]]). [[Fat]] serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n[[Microorganisms]] like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of [[skin flora]] depends on region of the skin.

It is generally permeable, and in the case of many [[amphibians]], may actually be a major respiratory organ. The [[dermis]] of [[bony fish]] typically contains relatively little of the [[connective tissue]] found in [[tetrapod]]s. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony [[scale (zoology)|scales]]. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the [[skull]], these [[scale (zoology)|scales]] are lost in [[tetrapods]], although many [[reptile]]s do have [[scale (zoology)|scales]] of a different kind, as do [[pangolin]]s. [[Cartilaginous fish]] have numerous tooth-like [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] embedded in their skin, in place of true [[scale (zoology)|scales]].\n\n[[Sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s are both unique to [[mammals]], but other types of skin gland are found in other [[vertebrates]]. [[Fish]] typically have a numerous individual [[mucus]]-secreting skin [[cell (biology)|cells]] that aid in insulation and protection, but may also have [[poison]] [[glands]], [[photophore]]s, or [[cell (biology)|cells]] that produce a more watery, [[serous]] fluid. In [[amphibians]], the [[mucus]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are gathered together to form sac-like [[glands]]. Most living [[amphibians]] also possess ''granular [[glands]]'' in the skin, that secrete irritating or toxic compounds.<ref name=VB/>\n\nAlthough [[melanin]] is found in the skin of many species, in the [[reptile]]s, the [[amphibians]], and [[fish]], the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is often relatively colorless. Instead, the color of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to melanin, may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the color of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].<ref name=VB/>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n''See also: [[amphibian]]s''\n\n==== Overview ====\nAmphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms |publisher= ScienceDirect|language=en|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1\u201329 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:FrogSkin.png|thumb|616x616px|'''Frog Gland Anatomy-''' A: Mucous gland (alveolus), B: Chromophore, C: Granular Gland (alveolus), D: Connective Tissue, E: Stratum Corneum, F: Transition Zone (intercalary region), G: Epidermis (Where the duct resides), H: Dermis]]\n\n==== Granular Glands ====\nGranular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStructurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA635&lpg=PA635&dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position. BMP signals from the epidermis inhibit the formation of placodes in nearby ectoderm.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|It is believed that the mesoderm defines the pattern. The epidermis instructs the mesodermal cells to condense and then the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of what structure to make through a series of reciprocal inductions.

Instead, the color of the skin is largely due to [[chromatophore]]s in the [[dermis]], which, in addition to melanin, may contain [[guanine]] or [[carotenoid]] [[pigments]]. Many species, such as [[chameleon]]s and [[flounder]]s may be able to change the color of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their [[chromatophores]].<ref name=VB/>\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n''See also: [[amphibian]]s''\n\n==== Overview ====\nAmphibians possess two types of [[gland]]s, [[Mucous gland|mucous]] and granular (serous). Both of these glands are part of the [[integument]] and thus considered [[cutaneous]]. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via [[keratinocyte]]s and passes through to the surface of the [[Epidermis|epidermal]] or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Cutaneous granular glands and amphibian venoms |publisher= ScienceDirect|language=en|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(95)98515-I|volume=111|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|pages=1\u201329 | last1 = Toledo | first1 = R.C.|year=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:FrogSkin.png|thumb|616x616px|'''Frog Gland Anatomy-''' A: Mucous gland (alveolus), B: Chromophore, C: Granular Gland (alveolus), D: Connective Tissue, E: Stratum Corneum, F: Transition Zone (intercalary region), G: Epidermis (Where the duct resides), H: Dermis]]\n\n==== Granular Glands ====\nGranular glands can be identified as [[venom]]ous and often differ in the type of toxin as well as the concentrations of secretions across various orders and species within the amphibians. They are located in clusters differing in concentration depending on [[amphibian]] taxa. The toxins can be fatal to most vertebrates or have no effect against others. These glands are alveolar meaning they structurally have little sacs in which venom is produced and held before it is secreted upon defensive behaviors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStructurally, the ducts of the granular gland initially maintain a cylindrical shape. However, when the ducts become mature and full of toxic fluid, the base of the ducts become swollen due to the pressure from the inside. This causes the epidermal layer to form a pit like opening on the surface of the duct in which the inner fluid will be secreted in an upwards fashion.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UklQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA635&lpg=PA635&dq=necturus+integument+google+book#v=onepage&q=necturus%20integument%20google%20book&f=false|title=Journal of Morphology|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology .|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe intercalary region of granular glands are more developed and mature in comparison with mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an [[ectoderm]]al muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe gland alveolus is a sac that is divided into three specific regions/layers. The outer layer or tunica fibrosa is composed of densely packed connective-tissue which connects with fibers from the spongy intermediate layer where elastic fibers as well as nerves reside. The nerves send signals to the muscles as well as the epithelial layers. Lastly, the epithelium or tunica propria encloses the gland.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Mucous Glands ====\nMucous glands are non-venomous and offer a different functionality for amphibians than granular. Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ducts of the mucous gland appear as cylindrical vertical tubes which break through the epidermal layer to the surface of the skin. The cells lining the inside of the ducts are oriented with their longitudinal axis forming 90 degree angles surrounding the duct in a helical fashion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIntercalary cells react identically to those of granular glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified intercalary region (depending on the function of the glands), yet the majority share the same structure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe alveolor of mucous glands are much more simple and only consist of an epithelium layer as well as connective tissue which forms a cover over the gland. This gland lacks a tunica propria and appears to have delicate and intricate fibers which pass over the gland's muscle and epithelial layers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Birds and reptiles===\n{{Main|Reptile scales}}\nThe [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s is closer to that of [[mammals]], with a layer of dead keratin-filled [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial [[amphibians]] such as [[toad]]s. However, in all of these animals there is no clear [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] into distinct layers, as occurs in [[human]]s, with the change in [[cell (biology)|cell]] type being relatively gradual. The mammalian [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] always possesses at least a [[stratum germinativum]] and [[stratum corneum]], but the other intermediate layers found in [[human]]s are not always distinguishable.\n[[Hair]] is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin, while [[feather]]s are (at least among living species) similarly unique to [[bird]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 129\u2013145|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Bird]]s and [[reptile]]s have relatively few skin [[gland]]s, although there may be a few structures for specific purposes, such as [[pheromone]]-secreting [[cell (biology)|cells]] in some [[reptile]]s, or the [[uropygial gland]] of most birds.<ref name=VB/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Cn span|Cutaneous structures arise from the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and nails. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]].  The basal layer is a [[stem cell]] layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an [[autocrine]] signal, [[Transforming growth factor|TGF-a]], and through [[paracrine]] signal FGF7 aka [[keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|Hair and feathers are formed in a regular pattern and it is believed to be the result of a reaction-diffusion system. This [[reaction-diffusion system]] combines an activator, [[Sonic hedgehog]], with an inhibitor, BMP4 or BMP2, to form clusters of cells in a regular pattern. Sonic hedgehog-expressing epidermal cells induce the condensation of cells in the mesoderm. The clusters of mesodermal cells signal back to the epidermis to form the appropriate structure for that position. BMP signals from the epidermis inhibit the formation of placodes in nearby ectoderm.|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{Cn span|It is believed that the mesoderm defines the pattern. The epidermis instructs the mesodermal cells to condense and then the mesoderm instructs the epidermis of what structure to make through a series of reciprocal inductions.

It was released on October 30, 2007, by [[Jive Records]]. It was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, but was rush-released after being [[internet leak|leaked]] online. The album was recorded between 2006 and 2007, during which time Spears' personal struggles and erratic behavior were highly publicized and overshadowed her professional projects. Spears collaborated with producers including [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Sean Garrett]], and [[The Neptunes]]. ''Blackout'' is a primarily [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] record with [[Euro disco]] and [[dubstep]] influences; lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing. The project features a more foreboding and atmospheric tone compared to Spears' previous albums.\n\n''Blackout'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom described it as Spears' most progressive and consistent album. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 290,000 copies after a last-minute rule change, and became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States. However, it was later certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted within the top ten of several national charts internationally and has topped the albums chart in Canada, Ireland, and the pan-[[European Top 100 Albums]] and has attained several certifications worldwide, including gold certification in seven countries, platinum in four countries, and multi-platinum in Russia.\n\nThe singles \"[[Gimme More]]\", \"[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]\", and \"[[Break the Ice (song)|Break the Ice]]\" respectively peaked at numbers three, 18, and 43 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Unlike her previous albums, Spears did not heavily promote ''Blackout''; her only televised appearance for ''Blackout'' was [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears' performance|a universally panned performance]] of \"Gimme More\" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. However, many of the songs of ''Blackout'' were performed on her tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] in 2009. Retrospectively, ''Blackout'' received widespread acclaim, with some citing its influence on pop music years later and it also ranked on many end-of-decade lists. ''[[The Times]]'' named it as the fifth best pop album of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best pop albums of the Noughties {{!}} The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417940.ece|website=The Times|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the album was added to the library and archives of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: \"I can believe the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that.\" During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that ''Long Road Out of Eden'' had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on ''Billboard.biz'' that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, ''Billboard'' would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week.

Ewing explained that \"The ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' blueprint for pop albums \u2013 every track good, every track a potential hit \u2013 makes more sense than ever. Especially if a star can keep sonically up-to-date in a fast-moving market.\"<ref name=pitchfork />\n\nReviewers noted the use of [[Auto-Tune]] in Spears' voice.<ref name=pitchfork /><ref name=telephone /> Ewing said that ''Blackout'' serves as a reminder of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that \"treated or untreated: her thin Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop.\" He noted that the album \"is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them.\"<ref name=pitchfork /> While reviewing Spears' demo of \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\", Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' compared it to \"Piece of Me\", \"proving yet again how much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop.

It was released on October 30, 2007, by [[Jive Records]]. It was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, but was rush-released after being [[internet leak|leaked]] online. The album was recorded between 2006 and 2007, during which time Spears' personal struggles and erratic behavior were highly publicized and overshadowed her professional projects. Spears collaborated with producers including [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Sean Garrett]], and [[The Neptunes]]. ''Blackout'' is a primarily [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] record with [[Euro disco]] and [[dubstep]] influences; lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing. The project features a more foreboding and atmospheric tone compared to Spears' previous albums.\n\n''Blackout'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom described it as Spears' most progressive and consistent album. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 290,000 copies after a last-minute rule change, and became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States. However, it was later certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted within the top ten of several national charts internationally and has topped the albums chart in Canada, Ireland, and the pan-[[European Top 100 Albums]] and has attained several certifications worldwide, including gold certification in seven countries, platinum in four countries, and multi-platinum in Russia.\n\nThe singles \"[[Gimme More]]\", \"[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]\", and \"[[Break the Ice (song)|Break the Ice]]\" respectively peaked at numbers three, 18, and 43 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Unlike her previous albums, Spears did not heavily promote ''Blackout''; her only televised appearance for ''Blackout'' was [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears' performance|a universally panned performance]] of \"Gimme More\" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. However, many of the songs of ''Blackout'' were performed on her tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] in 2009. Retrospectively, ''Blackout'' received widespread acclaim, with some citing its influence on pop music years later and it also ranked on many end-of-decade lists. ''[[The Times]]'' named it as the fifth best pop album of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best pop albums of the Noughties {{!}} The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417940.ece|website=The Times|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the album was added to the library and archives of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2019, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''Blackout'' one of the most influential pop albums to impact the 2010s.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/biggest-pop-influences-on-2010s-927808/</ref>\n\n== Background and development ==\n[[File:You Want a Piece of Me?

Jessica Letkemann of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' compared the sales favorably to those of the number-one album of the previous week, [[Carrie Underwood]]'s ''[[Carnival Ride]]'', which sold 49,000 copies. Letkemann also estimated that ''Blackout'' would possibly debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573290/20071101/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Blackout Projected To Light Up The Charts For Fifth No. 1 Debut|work=MTV News|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=November 1, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> On November 6, 2007, ''Billboard'' announced that even though [[The Eagles]]'s first-week sales of ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'' had handily surpassed Spears, they would not debut atop the chart because of rules forbidding albums exclusively sold at one retail outlet ([[Walmart]] in this case) from entering the ''Billboard'' 200. The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: \"I can believe the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that.\" During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that ''Long Road Out of Eden'' had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on ''Billboard.biz'' that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, ''Billboard'' would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week. Hence ''Long Road Out of Eden'' would top the ''Billboard'' 200, while ''Blackout'' would debut at number two, with sales of 290,000 copies.<ref name=eagles>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573657/britney-spears-blackout-denied-1-debut.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Blackout Denied No. 1 Debut On Billboard Chart After Last-Minute Rule Change|work=MTV News|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> It became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one.<ref name=recorddigital>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/britney-spears-debuts-1-on-european-albums-chart-and-debuts-1-on-us-digital-albums-chart-58819832.html|title=Britney Spears Debuts #1 on European Albums Chart and Debuts #1 on U.S. Digital Albums Chart|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref> The album, however, set the record as the best-selling digital album debut by a female artist in a week at the time.<ref name=recorddigital /> Following the release of ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' in December 2008, ''Blackout'' re-entered the chart at number one-hundred-and-ninety-eight, with sales of 4,600 copies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1601037/20081210/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Is Back On Top As Circus Sells More Than 500,000 Copies|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 10, 2008|work=MTV News|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> As of March 2015, the album had been certified Platinum in the United States for shipments of 1 Million copies.

Ewing explained that \"The ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' blueprint for pop albums \u2013 every track good, every track a potential hit \u2013 makes more sense than ever.
