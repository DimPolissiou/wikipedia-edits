Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

This period is also colloquially referred to as '''Between the Wars'''.\n\nDespite the relatively short period of time, this period represented an era of significant changes worldwide. Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the [[Roaring Twenties]], a period of economic prosperity and growth for the [[middle class]] in North America, Europe and many other parts of the world. Automobiles, electric lighting, radio broadcasts and more became commonplace among populations in the developed world. The indulgences of this era subsequently were followed by the [[Great Depression]], an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn which severely damaged many of the world's largest economies.\n\nPolitically, this era coincided with the rise of [[communism]], starting in Russia with the [[October Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], at the end of World War I, and ended with the rise of [[fascism]], particularly in Germany and in Italy. China was in the midst of a half-century of instability and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. The empires of [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]] and others faced challenges as [[imperialism]] was increasingly viewed negatively in Europe, and independence movements emerged in many colonies; [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the southern part of Ireland became independent after much fighting.]]\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German empire]]s were dismantled, while the [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were redistributed among the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], chiefly Britain and France. The western parts of the Russian Empire, [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] became independent nations in their own right, while [[Bessarabia]] (modern-day [[Moldova]]) chose to reunify with [[Romania]].\n\nThe Russian communists managed to regain control of the other East Slavic states, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, forming the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was partitioned]] between the independent [[Irish Free State]] and the British-controlled [[Northern Ireland]]; there followed the [[Irish Civil War]], in which the Free State fought against [[IRA (1922-69)|\"anti-treaty\" Irish republicans]] who opposed partition and partial independence. In the [[Middle East]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] gained independence. During the Great Depression, [[Latin America]]n countries nationalised many foreign companies (mostly American) in a bid to strengthen their own economies. The territorial ambitions of the Soviets, Japanese, Italians and Germans led to the expansion of their domains. \n\nThe interwar period ended in September 1939, with the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of [[World War II]].\n\n== Turmoil in Europe ==\n{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}\n[[File:Europe in 1923.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A map of Europe in 1923]]\nFollowing the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne]] on November 11, 1918 that ended World War I, the years 1918\u201324 were marked by turmoil as the [[Russian Civil War]] continued to rage on, and Eastern Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilising effects of not just the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], but the destruction of the [[German Empire]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], as well. There were numerous new nations in Eastern Europe, some small in size, such as [[Lithuania]] or [[Latvia]], and some large and vast, such as [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other former members of the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente]], the Americans came up with the [[Dawes Plan]] and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known as the [[Roaring Twenties]].<ref>B\u00e4rbel Schrader, and J\u00fcrgen Schebera.

However, the League of Nations played little role in this effort, with the United States and Britain taking the lead. U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] sponsored the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921 in determining how many capital ships each major country was allowed. The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s. Britain played a leading role in the 1927 [[Geneva Naval Conference]] and the 1930 London Conference that led to the [[London Naval Treaty]], which added cruisers and submarines to the list of ship allocations. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and the USSR to go along with this led to the meaningless [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936. Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1889320|title = The \"Yardstick\" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 45|issue = 3|pages = 441\u2013463|last1 = O'Connor|first1 = Raymond G.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/1889320}}</ref><ref>B.

Fascists believed in power, violence, male superiority, and a \"natural\" hierarchy, often led by dictators such as [[Benito Mussolini]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded, and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best.<ref>Robert Soucy, \"Fascism\" [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Common-characteristics-of-fascist-movements ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 2015]</ref>\n\n=== Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}\nTo one degree or another, Spain had been unstable politically for centuries, and in 1936-39 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century. The real importance comes from outside countries. In Spain the conservative and Catholic elements and the army revolted against the newly elected government, and full-scale civil war erupted. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalists, led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Republican (or \"Loyalist\") government, was on the defensive, but it received significant help from the Soviet Union. Led by Great Britain and France, and including the United States, most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side. The powerful fear was that this localised conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that no one wanted.<ref>Stanley G.

The Soviet Union provided armaments but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the \"International Brigades\" of outside far-left volunteers. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics, conservatives and fascists. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another great war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref>E.H.

This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]].

The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies, of Alsace and Lorraine, and of predominantly Polish districts. The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland, and Germany was not allowed to have a real army, navy, or air force. Reparations were demanded, especially by France, involving shipments of raw materials, as well as annual payments.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Weimar: Why did German Democracy Fail?''</ref>\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The German government printed vast quantities of paper money, causing hyperinflation, which also damaged the French economy. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved. Weimar added new internal enemies every year, as anti-democratic Nazis, Nationalists, and Communists battled each other in the streets. See [[1920s German inflation]].<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy'' (2013)</ref>\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually agreed to cancel all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy, and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed., ''Weimar Germany'' (2009) pp. 50\u201377</ref>\n\n=== Nazi era, 1933\u201339 ===\n{{Main|Nazi Germany|Causes of World War II}}\nHitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe.

When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]], rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]], and began to rearm. Retaking the Saar Basin in the aftermath of a plebiscite that favoured returning to Germany, Hitler's Germany remilitarised the Rhineland, formed an alliance with Mussolini's Italy, and sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Germany seized Austria, considered to be a German state, in 1938, and took over Czechoslovakia after the [[Munich Agreement]] with Britain and France. Forming a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|peace pact]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Germany invaded Poland after their refusal to cede [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] in September 1939.

Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]].

Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smouldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]].

The early 1930s were marked by social unrest, high unemployment, and strikes. In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners' strike in [[Valea Jiului]] and the strike in the [[Grivita|Grivi\u0163a]] railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture. French economic and political influence was predominant in the early 1920s but then Germany became more dominant, especially in the 1930s.<ref>William A. Hoisington Jr, \"The Struggle for Economic Influence in Southeastern Europe: The French Failure in Romania, 1940.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 43.3 (1971): 468-482. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878564 online]</ref>\n\n=== Japanese Dominance in East Asia ===\nThe Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced European models. They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. The most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper, and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminium, 85 percent of the iron ore, and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies. It was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, of oil and iron.<ref>John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, and Albert M. Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 501-4.</ref>\n\nJapan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains. Together, with the British Empire, it divided up Germany's territories scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the [[Twenty-One Demands]] of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference. At the end of the war, Japan was frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its demands for racial parity, and an increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system, and favoured internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.<ref>Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 563\u2013612, 666.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy. Japan's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japan's prime minister and the military took more power, leading to the rapid decline in democracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul W.

It created the puppet government of [[Manchukuo]]. Britain and France effectively controlled the League of Nations, which issued the [[Lytton Report]] in 1932, saying that Japan had genuine grievances, but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province. Japan quit the League, Britain took no action. The US Secretary of State announces that it would not recognize Japan's conquest as legitimate. Germany welcomed Japan's actions.<ref>David Wen-wei Chang, \"The Western Powers and Japan's Aggression in China: The League of Nations and 'The Lytton Report'.\" ''American Journal of Chinese Studies'' (2003): 43-63.

On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. The new Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] tried to negotiate with China, but was assassinated in the [[May 15 Incident]] in 1932, which ushered in an era of nationalism led by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and supported by other right-wing societies. The IJA's nationalism ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945.<ref>{{cite book|author=James L.

One faction saw the Soviet Union as the main enemy, the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalised. Large-scale warfare, known as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]] in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape. By 1939 military lines had stabilised, with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up.<ref>Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 589-613</ref> In the U.S., government and public opinion\u2014even including those who were isolationist regarding Europe\u2014was resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China. Meanwhile, the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with Soviet forces in Mongolia at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in summer 1939. The USSR was too powerful. Tokyo and Moscow [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact|signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941]], as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently-needed oil fields.<ref>Herbert Feis, ''The Road to Pearl Harbor: The Coming of the War Between the United States and Japan'' (1960) pp 8-150.</ref>\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution industrialisation]]. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] (1933\u20131945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a [[Good Neighbor policy|Good Neighbour policy]] and allowed the nationalisation of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] nationalised American oil companies, out of which he created [[Pemex]]. C\u00e1rdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together, with Argentina the main hold out.<ref>Victor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Economic History of Latin America since Independence'' (2nd ed. 2003) pp. 189\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, United States policy makers continued to be concerned over German influence in Latin America.<ref name=Goebels>{{cite journal |last1=Goebel |first1=Michael |date=2009 |title=Decentring the German Spirit: The Weimar Republic's Cultural Relations with Latin America |url= |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=221\u2013245 |doi= 10.1177/0022009408101249}}</ref><ref name=Penny2017>{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=H.

This period is also colloquially referred to as '''Between the Wars'''.\n\nDespite the relatively short period of time, this period represented an era of significant changes worldwide. Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the [[Roaring Twenties]], a period of economic prosperity and growth for the [[middle class]] in North America, Europe and many other parts of the world. Automobiles, electric lighting, radio broadcasts and more became commonplace among populations in the developed world. The indulgences of this era subsequently were followed by the [[Great Depression]], an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn which severely damaged many of the world's largest economies.\n\nPolitically, this era coincided with the rise of [[communism]], starting in Russia with the [[October Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], at the end of World War I, and ended with the rise of [[fascism]], particularly in Germany and in Italy. China was in the midst of a half-century of instability and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. The empires of [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]] and others faced challenges as [[imperialism]] was increasingly viewed negatively in Europe, and independence movements emerged in many colonies; [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the southern part of Ireland became independent after much fighting.]]\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German empire]]s were dismantled, while the [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were redistributed among the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], chiefly Britain and France. The western parts of the Russian Empire, [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] became independent nations in their own right, while [[Bessarabia]] (modern-day [[Moldova]]) chose to reunify with [[Romania]].\n\nThe Russian communists managed to regain control of the other East Slavic states, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, forming the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was partitioned]] between the independent [[Irish Free State]] and the British-controlled [[Northern Ireland]]; there followed the [[Irish Civil War]], in which the Free State fought against [[IRA (1922-69)|\"anti-treaty\" Irish republicans]] who opposed partition and partial independence. In the [[Middle East]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] gained independence. During the Great Depression, [[Latin America]]n countries nationalised many foreign companies (mostly American) in a bid to strengthen their own economies. The territorial ambitions of the Soviets, Japanese, Italians and Germans led to the expansion of their domains. \n\nThe interwar period ended in September 1939, with the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of [[World War II]].\n\n== Turmoil in Europe ==\n{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}\n[[File:Europe in 1923.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A map of Europe in 1923]]\nFollowing the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne]] on November 11, 1918 that ended World War I, the years 1918\u201324 were marked by turmoil as the [[Russian Civil War]] continued to rage on, and Eastern Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilising effects of not just the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], but the destruction of the [[German Empire]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], as well. There were numerous new nations in Eastern Europe, some small in size, such as [[Lithuania]] or [[Latvia]], and some large and vast, such as [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other former members of the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente]], the Americans came up with the [[Dawes Plan]] and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known as the [[Roaring Twenties]].<ref>B\u00e4rbel Schrader, and J\u00fcrgen Schebera.

However, the League of Nations played little role in this effort, with the United States and Britain taking the lead. U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] sponsored the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921 in determining how many capital ships each major country was allowed. The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s. Britain played a leading role in the 1927 [[Geneva Naval Conference]] and the 1930 London Conference that led to the [[London Naval Treaty]], which added cruisers and submarines to the list of ship allocations. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and the USSR to go along with this led to the meaningless [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936. Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1889320|title = The \"Yardstick\" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 45|issue = 3|pages = 441\u2013463|last1 = O'Connor|first1 = Raymond G.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/1889320}}</ref><ref>B.

There was unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media began to focus on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars. Major cities built large sports stadiums for the fans, in addition to palatial [[Movie theater|cinemas]]. The mechanisation of agriculture continued apace, producing an expansion of output that lowered prices, and made many farm workers redundant. Often they moved to nearby industrial towns and cities.\n\n== Great Depression ==\nThe [[Great Depression]] was a severe worldwide [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] that took place after 1929.

Economic disaster led to a distrust in the effectiveness of democracy and its collapse in much of Europe, including the Baltic and Balkan countries, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. Powerful expansionary dictatorships emerged in Italy, Japan, and Germany.<ref>Stephen J. Lee, ''European Dictatorships 1918\u20131945'' (Routledge, 2016)</ref>\n\nWhile communism was tightly contained in the isolated Soviet Union, fascism took control of Italy in 1922; as the Great Depression worsened, fascism emerged victorious in Germany and in many other countries in Europe, it also played a major role in several countries in Latin America.<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945 ''(1995)</ref> Fascist parties sprang up, attuned to local right-wing traditions, but also possessing common features that typically included extreme militaristic nationalism, a desire for economic self-containment, threats and aggression toward neighbouring countries, oppression of minorities, a ridicule of democracy while using its techniques to mobilise an angry middle-class base, and a disgust with cultural liberalism. Fascists believed in power, violence, male superiority, and a \"natural\" hierarchy, often led by dictators such as [[Benito Mussolini]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded, and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best.<ref>Robert Soucy, \"Fascism\" [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Common-characteristics-of-fascist-movements ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 2015]</ref>\n\n=== Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}\nTo one degree or another, Spain had been unstable politically for centuries, and in 1936-39 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century. The real importance comes from outside countries. In Spain the conservative and Catholic elements and the army revolted against the newly elected government, and full-scale civil war erupted. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalists, led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Republican (or \"Loyalist\") government, was on the defensive, but it received significant help from the Soviet Union. Led by Great Britain and France, and including the United States, most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side. The powerful fear was that this localised conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that no one wanted.<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp 262-76</ref><ref>Hugh Thomas, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (2nd ed. 2001).</ref>\n\nThe Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the Nationalists won in 1939 by overwhelming the Republican forces. The Soviet Union provided armaments but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the \"International Brigades\" of outside far-left volunteers. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics, conservatives and fascists. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another great war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref>E.H.

The [[1917 Balfour Declaration]], which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]]. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]].<ref>Mowat 12:269\u201396.</ref>\n\nThe Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland) were self-governing and gained semi-independence in the World War, while Britain still controlled foreign policy and defence.

The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies, of Alsace and Lorraine, and of predominantly Polish districts. The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland, and Germany was not allowed to have a real army, navy, or air force. Reparations were demanded, especially by France, involving shipments of raw materials, as well as annual payments.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Weimar: Why did German Democracy Fail?''</ref>\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The German government printed vast quantities of paper money, causing hyperinflation, which also damaged the French economy. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved. Weimar added new internal enemies every year, as anti-democratic Nazis, Nationalists, and Communists battled each other in the streets. See [[1920s German inflation]].<ref>Eric D.

Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually agreed to cancel all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy, and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed., ''Weimar Germany'' (2009) pp. 50\u201377</ref>\n\n=== Nazi era, 1933\u201339 ===\n{{Main|Nazi Germany|Causes of World War II}}\nHitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe.

When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]], rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]], and began to rearm. Retaking the Saar Basin in the aftermath of a plebiscite that favoured returning to Germany, Hitler's Germany remilitarised the Rhineland, formed an alliance with Mussolini's Italy, and sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Germany seized Austria, considered to be a German state, in 1938, and took over Czechoslovakia after the [[Munich Agreement]] with Britain and France. Forming a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|peace pact]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Germany invaded Poland after their refusal to cede [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] in September 1939.

Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government.<ref name=\"Donald Cameron Watt 1989\">Donald Cameron Watt, ''How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938\u20131939'' (1989).</ref><ref name=\"R.J.

Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smouldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany.

In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners' strike in [[Valea Jiului]] and the strike in the [[Grivita|Grivi\u0163a]] railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture.

They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. The most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper, and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminium, 85 percent of the iron ore, and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies. It was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, of oil and iron.<ref>John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, and Albert M. Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 501-4.</ref>\n\nJapan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains. Together, with the British Empire, it divided up Germany's territories scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the [[Twenty-One Demands]] of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference. At the end of the war, Japan was frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its demands for racial parity, and an increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system, and favoured internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.<ref>Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 563\u2013612, 666.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy. Japan's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japan's prime minister and the military took more power, leading to the rapid decline in democracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul W.

On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. The new Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] tried to negotiate with China, but was assassinated in the [[May 15 Incident]] in 1932, which ushered in an era of nationalism led by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and supported by other right-wing societies.

One faction saw the Soviet Union as the main enemy, the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalised. Large-scale warfare, known as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]] in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape. By 1939 military lines had stabilised, with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up.<ref>Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig.

The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution industrialisation]]. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] (1933\u20131945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a [[Good Neighbor policy|Good Neighbour policy]] and allowed the nationalisation of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] nationalised American oil companies, out of which he created [[Pemex]]. C\u00e1rdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together, with Argentina the main hold out.<ref>Victor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Economic History of Latin America since Independence'' (2nd ed. 2003) pp. 189\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, United States policy makers continued to be concerned over German influence in Latin America.<ref name=Goebels>{{cite journal |last1=Goebel |first1=Michael |date=2009 |title=Decentring the German Spirit: The Weimar Republic's Cultural Relations with Latin America |url= |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=221\u2013245 |doi= 10.1177/0022009408101249}}</ref><ref name=Penny2017>{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=H.

Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition.
