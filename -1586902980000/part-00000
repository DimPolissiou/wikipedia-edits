She is best known for her long poem, ''The Distaff'', a three-hundred line [[dactylic hexameter|hexameter]] lament for her childhood friend Baucis, who had died shortly after marriage.  A large fragment of this poem was discovered in 1928 at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt.  Along with ''The Distaff'', three epigrams ascribed to Erinna are known, preserved in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]''.  Biographical details about Erinna's life are uncertain. She is generally thought to have lived in the first half of the fourth century BC, though some ancient traditions have her as a contemporary of [[Sappho]]; [[Tilos|Telos]] is generally considered to be her most likely birthplace, but [[Tinos|Tenos]], [[Teos]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Lesbos]] are all also mentioned by ancient sources as her home.  \n\n==Life==\nLittle ancient evidence about Erinna's life survives, and the testimony which does is often contradictory.  Her dates are uncertain.  According to the [[Suda]], she was one of Sappho's companions, placing her floruit in the sixth century BC.{{sfn|Levin|1962|p=193}}  The latest date given for Erinna in the ancient testimonia is that provided by [[Eusebius]], who suggests the mid-fourth century BC.{{sfn|Levin|1962|p=194}}  Scholars now tend to believe that Erinna was an early Hellenistic poet.{{sfn|Levin|1962|p=193}}\n\nAncient testimony is divided on where Erinna was from: possibilities include [[Teos]], [[Tilos|Telos]], [[Tinos|Tenos]], [[Mytilene]], and [[Rhodes]].{{sfn|Arthur|1980|p=57}}  Sylvia Barnard argues that Erinna was from Telos on the grounds of her dialect,{{sfn|Barnard|1978|p=204}} though Donald Levin notes that while based on [[Doric Greek|Doric]], Erinna's dialect is a literary creation and does not accurately reflect her own native dialect.{{sfn|Levin|1962|p=195}}  It is likely that Erinna was born into a wealthy family, and would have been taught to read and write poetry \u2013 Teos, one of Erinna's possible birthplaces, is one of the few places in the ancient Greek world where epigraphical evidence that girls were educated survives.{{sfn|Pomeroy|1978|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThree epigrams preserved in the [[Greek Anthology]] suggest that Erinna died young \u2013 according to Asclepiades shortly after composing the ''Distaff'' aged 19, though the earliest source to explicitly fix her date of death at age 19 is the Suda.{{sfn|West|1977|pp=95\u20136}}  Marylin B. Arthur, however, argues that though the character of Erinna in the ''Distaff'' was 19, it is not necessarily the case that she did compose the poem when she was that age.{{sfn|Arthur|1980|p=56}}\n\n==Works==\n===''The Distaff''===\n[[File:Ossirinco, frammento di papiro con alakata (conocchia) di erinna, 190 dc ca.

Finally, there is a reference to the narrator's inability to view a corpse, and two mentions of the word ''aidos'' (\"shame\") &ndash; presumably Baucis has died, and the narrator is ashamed that she cannot mourn her friend.  At this point the text becomes too fragmentary to reconstruct it further.{{sfn|Snyder|1991|p=95}}\n\nThe ''Distaff'' is a literary version of the ''goos'' &ndash; the lament chanted by the female relatives of the deceased during the ''[[Ancient Greek funeral and burial practices|prothesis]]'' (laying out the body).{{sfn|Manwell|2005|p=76}}{{sfn|Skinner|1982|p=266}}  Earlier literary depictions of the ''goos'', also in hexameter verse, are found in the ''[[Iliad]]'', and several scholars have seen Erinna's poem as making use of this literary precedent.

The first case was identified on 9 March,<ref name=\"firstcase\"/> and transmission within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 24 March.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> As of 14 April, there have been 223 cases identified in the Bailiwick, all in Guernsey,{{refn|group=note|'Guernsey' refers to the entire jurisdiction of Guernsey, which includes the island of Guernsey as well as the three inhabited islands of [[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]].}} and 7 people are confirmed to have died from the infection.{{refn|group=note|The States of Guernsey has also recorded (separately) 3 'presumptive' deaths presumed to be due to COVID-19.}}\n\nThe [[States of Guernsey]] response is led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA), a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island, chaired by [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey#List of heads of government of Guernsey|Chief Minister]] [[Gavin St Pier]].

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days.

Thus were the Scots nobles confident in their letters to Pope John of the distinct and independent nature of Scotland's kingdom; the ''Declaration of Arbroath'' was one such. According to historian [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]], \"The two nations were mutually hostile kingdoms and peoples, and the ancient idea of Britain as an informal empire of peoples under the English king's presidency was entirely dead.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe text makes claims about the ancient history of Scotland and especially the ''[[Scoti]]'', forbears of the [[Scottish people|Scots]], who the ''Declaration'' claims originated in [[Scythia|''Scythia Major'']] and migrated via Spain to Britain, dating their migration to \"1,200 years from the [[Crossing the Red Sea|Israelite people's crossing of the Red Sea]]\".{{ref|a}} The ''Declaration'' describes how the Scots had \"thrown out the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] and completely destroyed the [[Picts]]\",{{ref|a}} resisted the invasions of \"the Norse, the Danes and the English\",{{ref|a}} and \"held itself ever since, free from all slavery\".{{ref|a}} It then claims that in the Kingdom of Scotland, \"one hundred and thirteen kings have reigned of their own [[Royal descent|Blood Royal]], without interruption by foreigners\".{{ref|a}} The text compares Robert Bruce with the Biblical warriors [[Judas Maccabeus]] and [[Joshua]].{{ref|a}}\n\nThe ''Declaration'' made a number of points: that Edward I of England had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish nation from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. (However this should be taken in the context of the time - \u2018Scottish People\u2019 refers to the Scottish nobility, rather than commoners.) In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotland's independence.\n\n==Debates==\nSome have interpreted this last point as an early expression of '[[popular sovereignty]]'{{sfn|McLean|2005|p=247}} &ndash; that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by God alone. Modern Scottish nationalists point to the \u201cDeclaration\" as evidence of the long-term persistence of the Scots as a distinct national community, giving a very early date for the emergence of [[nationalism]]. However, \"the overwhelming majority of academics challenge this vision. Scholars point out that definitions change with time.

Thus were the Scots nobles confident in their letters to Pope John of the distinct and independent nature of Scotland's kingdom; the ''Declaration of Arbroath'' was one such. According to historian [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]], \"The two nations were mutually hostile kingdoms and peoples, and the ancient idea of Britain as an informal empire of peoples under the English king's presidency was entirely dead.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe text makes claims about the ancient history of Scotland and especially the ''[[Scoti]]'', forbears of the [[Scottish people|Scots]], who the ''Declaration'' claims originated in [[Scythia|''Scythia Major'']] and migrated via Spain to Britain, dating their migration to \"1,200 years from the [[Crossing the Red Sea|Israelite people's crossing of the Red Sea]]\".{{ref|a}} The ''Declaration'' describes how the Scots had \"thrown out the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] and completely destroyed the [[Picts]]\",{{ref|a}} resisted the invasions of \"the Norse, the Danes and the English\",{{ref|a}} and \"held itself ever since, free from all slavery\".{{ref|a}} It then claims that in the Kingdom of Scotland, \"one hundred and thirteen kings have reigned of their own [[Royal descent|Blood Royal]], without interruption by foreigners\".{{ref|a}} The text compares Robert Bruce with the Biblical warriors [[Judas Maccabeus]] and [[Joshua]].{{ref|a}}\n\nThe ''Declaration'' made a number of points: that Edward I of England had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish nation from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. (However this should be taken in the context of the time - \u2018Scottish People\u2019 refers to the Scottish nobility, rather than commoners.) In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotland's independence.\n\n==Debates==\nSome have interpreted this last point as an early expression of '[[popular sovereignty]]'{{sfn|McLean|2005|p=247}} &ndash; that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by God alone. Modern Scottish nationalists point to the \u201cDeclaration\" as evidence of the long-term persistence of the Scots as a distinct national community, giving a very early date for the emergence of [[nationalism]]. However, \"the overwhelming majority of academics challenge this vision. Scholars point out that definitions change with time.
