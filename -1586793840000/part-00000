LBJ would use up to 75 pens to sign each important document and bill, writing different strokes of the letters of his name with different pens, and giving them all away to allies and supporters with little typed certificates.

Created by the renowned designer [[Kenneth Grange]] based on a detailed brief,<ref> See Malcolm Toak, ''Pen to Paper, The Story of Newhaven's Pen Factory'', New Anzac Publications, 2005</ref> it was manufactured in [[Newhaven]], England and produced in a variety of different versions until 1999.<ref>See Parker Pens website, by Swedish pen historian Tony Fischier http://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> An eye-catching, contemporary-looking pen, with mainly steel components, the Parker 25 was intended to revive the company's fortunes. As ''The Guardian'' wrote, '(Grange's) classic Parker pen had the machined lustre of a bullet. In fact, its tapering barrel was inspired by an American space rocket, a form that enabled the lid to be the same diameter as the pen no matter which end it was attached to.'<ref>Justin McQuirk, 'Kenneth Grange, a very British modernist', ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2011, https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/19/kenneth-grange-british-modernist</ref> It was affordable enough to become a staple entry-level pen for both work and leisure uses - and for secondary school students at a time when fountain pens were still obligatory in many British schools. Advertising slogans used to market Parker 25s included 'Modern as Tomorrow', 'Space Age Design, Space Age Performance', 'European Styled' and 'Contemporary, Highly Functional Design'.<ref>See examples at More Engineering website created by former Parker engineer, http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/publications-and-prices/4584108238</ref>\n\nParker 25s were issued in several variants: initially, fountain pen, ballpoint, fibre point and mechanical pencil.<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/models/458277434</ref> A rollerball model was introduced in 1981, and fibre tips were phased out a couple of years later. While the great majority of Parker 25s were 'flighters', with a brushed steel finish, matte black and later white versions were issued between 1978 and 1987. The pens had four different trim colours - blue (the most common), black, green, and most rarely of all, orange. Orange trim Parker 25s were discontinued in 1976 following a copyright dispute with [[Rotring]], and surviving examples are very sought after. A striking feature of all Parker 25s is the square plastic tassie logo on the clip.\n\nThe earliest Mark I Parker 25 fountain pens dating from the first year of production feature a distinctive breather hole in the nib. While the original models had a flat plastic circle on top of the cap, Mark III and IV pens have a round ridge on this inner cap. Pens manufactured from 1980 feature letter date codes which were changed every quarter. Those manufactured from 1990 are stamped 'Made in UK'; earlier pens were inscribed 'Made in England'. Pens without any manufacture stamps, or inscribed 'Made in Aust', are very rare. Parker 25s were all assembled in Britain by hand<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/introduction/4582901246</ref> - unlike Jotters, Vectors and other mass market pens - and were very minimalist, comprising between 9 and 11 components.\n\nThe 25 was an extremely successful pen for Parker commercially, especially during its first decade or so of production.<ref>https://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> A number of promotional versions were made up to order, featuring company logos on the barrel (the matte black and white versions were often branded in this way), clip or cap.\n\nSome pen aficionados are rather disparaging about the Parker 25, which lacks the status of the legendary [[Parker Duofold]]<ref>See David Shepherd and Dan Zazove, ''Parker Duofold'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2006.</ref> or the storied [[Parker 51]]. <ref>See David Shepherd and Mark Shepherd, ''Parker \"51\"'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2004.</ref> But in recent years they have been enjoying a revival, their space age look evoking nostalgia for the final quarter of the twentieth century. The Parker 25 was even given the accolade of an exhibition stand at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>Kenneth Grange at the Boilerhouse, Parker 25, ''Design Council Slide Collection'', Victoria and Albert Museum, https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=53760&sos=0</ref>.\n\n\n===Parker Vector===\nThe precursor to the Parker Vector was introduced in 1981.  It was a simple cylindrical plastic cap and barrel [[roller-ball pen]] called the \"Parker RB1\".<ref>Note: The RB1 name stands for \"Rollerball 1\".</ref>  In 1984, Parker added the FP1 (\"Fountain Pen 1\"), with essentially the same design.  The RB1 and FP1 models were produced until 1986, at which time Parker revised the pen by lengthening the cap and shortening the barrel and renaming the new pen the \"Vector Standard\".  Presently, there are four models available (in plastic and steel): the fountain pen, capped rollerball, pushbutton ballpoint, and pushbutton pencil.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 ''When Parker Pens Ruled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812073307/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 |date=12 August 2017 }}; Tuesday, December 7, 2010; article; [[The Wall Street Journal]]; comment: about the relaunch of Parker Pens held at the Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.

LBJ would use up to 75 pens to sign each important document and bill, writing different strokes of the letters of his name with different pens, and giving them all away to allies and supporters with little typed certificates.

Created by the renowned designer [[Kenneth Grange]] based on a detailed brief,<ref> See Malcolm Toak, ''Pen to Paper, The Story of Newhaven's Pen Factory'', New Anzac Publications, 2005</ref> it was manufactured in [[Newhaven]], England and produced in a variety of different versions until 1999.<ref>See Parker Pens website, by Swedish pen historian Tony Fischier http://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> An eye-catching, contemporary-looking pen, with mainly steel components, the Parker 25 was intended to revive the company's fortunes. As ''The Guardian'' wrote, '(Grange's) classic Parker pen had the machined lustre of a bullet. In fact, its tapering barrel was inspired by an American space rocket, a form that enabled the lid to be the same diameter as the pen no matter which end it was attached to.'<ref>Justin McQuirk, 'Kenneth Grange, a very British modernist', ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2011, https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/19/kenneth-grange-british-modernist</ref> It was affordable enough to become a staple entry-level pen for both work and leisure uses - and for secondary school students at a time when fountain pens were still obligatory in many British schools. Advertising slogans used to market Parker 25s included 'Modern as Tomorrow', 'Space Age Design, Space Age Performance', 'European Styled' and 'Contemporary, Highly Functional Design'.<ref>See examples at More Engineering website created by former Parker engineer, http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/publications-and-prices/4584108238</ref>\n\nParker 25s were issued in several variants: initially, fountain pen, ballpoint, fibre point and mechanical pencil.<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/models/458277434</ref> A rollerball model was introduced in 1981, and fibre tips were phased out a couple of years later. While the great majority of Parker 25s were 'flighters', with a brushed steel finish, matte black and later white versions were issued between 1978 and 1987. The pens had four different trim colours - blue (the most common), black, green, and most rarely of all, orange. Orange trim Parker 25s were discontinued in 1976 following a copyright dispute with [[Rotring]], and surviving examples are very sought after. A striking feature of all Parker 25s is the square plastic tassie logo on the clip.\n\nThe earliest Mark I Parker 25 fountain pens dating from the first year of production feature a distinctive breather hole in the nib. While the original models had a flat plastic circle on top of the cap, Mark III and IV pens have a round ridge on this inner cap. Pens manufactured from 1980 feature letter date codes which were changed every quarter. Those manufactured from 1990 are stamped 'Made in UK'; earlier pens were inscribed 'Made in England'. Pens without any manufacture stamps, or inscribed 'Made in Aus', are very rare. Parker 25s were all assembled in Britain by hand<ref>http://www.moreengineering.co.uk/introduction/4582901246</ref> - unlike Jotters, Vectors and other mass market pens - and were very minimalist, comprising between 9 and 11 components.\n\nThe 25 was an extremely successful pen for Parker commercially, especially during its first decade or so of production.<ref>https://parkerpens.net/parker25.html</ref> A number of promotional versions were made up to order, featuring company logos on the barrel (the matte black and white versions were often branded in this way), clip or cap.\n\nSome pen aficionados are rather disparaging about the Parker 25, which lacks the status of the legendary [[Parker Duofold]]<ref>See David Shepherd and Dan Zazove, ''Parker Duofold'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2006.</ref> or the storied [[Parker 51]]. <ref>See David Shepherd and Mark Shepherd, ''Parker \"51\"'', Surrenden Pens Ltd, 2004.</ref> But in recent years they have been enjoying a revival, their space age look evoking nostalgia for the final quarter of the twentieth century. The Parker 25 was even given the accolade of an exhibition stand at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>Kenneth Grange at the Boilerhouse, Parker 25, ''Design Council Slide Collection'', Victoria and Albert Museum, https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=53760&sos=0</ref>.\n\n\n===Parker Vector===\nThe precursor to the Parker Vector was introduced in 1981.  It was a simple cylindrical plastic cap and barrel [[roller-ball pen]] called the \"Parker RB1\".<ref>Note: The RB1 name stands for \"Rollerball 1\".</ref>  In 1984, Parker added the FP1 (\"Fountain Pen 1\"), with essentially the same design.  The RB1 and FP1 models were produced until 1986, at which time Parker revised the pen by lengthening the cap and shortening the barrel and renaming the new pen the \"Vector Standard\".  Presently, there are four models available (in plastic and steel): the fountain pen, capped rollerball, pushbutton ballpoint, and pushbutton pencil.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 ''When Parker Pens Ruled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812073307/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703493504576007640835661876 |date=12 August 2017 }}; Tuesday, December 7, 2010; article; [[The Wall Street Journal]]; comment: about the relaunch of Parker Pens held at the Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.

as \"The Mini,\" it attracts runners and spectators from all over the United States and the entire world. In 2011, participants came from all fifty states and nine countries. The race includes a men's and women's running division, as well as men's and women's wheelchair entries. The '''Delta Dental 500 Festival 5K''', a shorter version of the Mini utilizing the same start and finish lines, runs the same day.\n\nThe Mini-Marathon began in 1977 and became an official '''500 Festival''' event in 1979. The 500 Festival, a not-for-profit volunteer organization, was created in 1957 to organize civic events celebrating the [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500-Mile Race]]. Over the past 55 years, the 500 Festival has grown to become one of the largest festivals in the nation. The Mini-Marathon is one of the first events of the month of May at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indy]].\n\nThe {{convert|13.1|mi|km|adj=on}} course currently starts in [[downtown Indianapolis]], includes city streets then heads west toward [[Speedway, Indiana|Speedway]]. It includes a full loop around the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], then returns to finish in the downtown area. From 1977\u20131992, the race was held the Friday before the Indianapolis 500 (part of [[Memorial Day]] weekend). Starting in 1993, the race was moved to early May, the Saturday three weeks before the race except a few exceptions.\n\nThe men's record for the Mini is 1:01:52 set by [[Nelson Oyugi]] in 2014. The women's record was set in 2010 by [[Janet Cherobon]] with a time of 1:10:59.\n\nFrom 1994\u20132004 it was known as the Indianapolis Life 500 Festival Mini-Marathon.\n\nIn 2020, the race was cancelled for the first time in its history, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirius pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2020/03/18/indianapolis-mini-marathon-canceled-first-time-43-years-coronavirus/2863524001/|title=Mini Marathon canceled for first time in 43 years|last=Woods|first=David|website=Indianapolis Star|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Selected history==\n===2008===\nThe race resulted in the closest finish ever in the history of the event: a tie.<ref>{{cite news| url =http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080503/LOCAL18/805030481 | archive-url =https://archive.is/20130616063031/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080503/LOCAL18/805030481 | url-status =dead | archive-date =2013-06-16 | title =2008 OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon sells out with 35,000 entries | publisher =Microchips record closest finish ever in Mini | date = 2008-05-03| accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref> Two Kenyan runners, Lamech Mokono and Valentine Orare, were declared co-winners, extending the streak of Kenyan victories to 13. In the women's race, defending champ Janet Cherobon made it two wins in a row. Tony Iniguez became a three-time champ in the wheelchair division.\n\n===2011===\nThe 2011 OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon took place Saturday May 7, 2011.  A pair of newcomers brought home the men's and women's titles in the 2011 OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon in Indianapolis. Moroccan [[Ridouane Harroufi]] took the men's race, winning in 1:02.45, while Everlyne Lagat of Kenya captured the women's race with a time of 1:11:29, snapping the four-year win streak of fellow Kenyan [[Janet Cherobon-Bawcom]], who took second. [[Adam Bleakney]] of Champaign, Ill., took advantage of the ideal conditions to win the wheelchair race with a blistering time of: 49.18. The 2006 winner of the same race, Bleakney, a member of the 2008 U.S. Paralympics teams, was competing in Indianapolis for the first time since his previous win.\n\n==Past

In [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] times, Lake Champlain was used as a water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] valleys. Travelers found it easier to journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than go overland on unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads. The lake's northern tip at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule), is a short distance from [[Montreal]], Quebec. The southern tip at [[Whitehall (town), New York|Whitehall]] (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is a short distance from [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], and [[Albany, New York]].\n\nForts were built at [[Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]] ([[Fort St. Frederic]]) to control passage on the lake in colonial times. Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1775. During the Revolutionary War, the British and Americans conducted a frenetic shipbuilding race through the spring and summer of 1776, at opposite ends of the lake, and fought a significant naval engagement on October 11 at the [[Battle of Valcour Island]]. While it was a tactical defeat for the Americans, and the small fleet led by [[Benedict Arnold]] was almost destroyed, the Americans gained a strategic victory; the British invasion was delayed long enough so the approach of winter prevented the fall of these forts until the following year. In this period, the [[Continental Army]] gained strength and was victorious at [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]].\n\n==== Beginning of the Revolutionary War ====\nAt the start of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], British forces occupied the [[Champlain Valley]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Revolution|last=Countryman|first=Edward|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=4}}</ref>  However, it did not take long for rebel leaders to realize the importance of controlling Lake Champlain.

Thus, the colonial militias devised a plan to take control of the two forts and bring the guns back to the fight in Boston.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Lake Champlain Ferry.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Champlain Ferries|Charlotte Ferry]], Lake Champlain]]\nThe necessity of controlling the two forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point placed Lake Champlain as a strategic arena during the Revolutionary War. By taking control of these forts, Americans not only gained heavy artillery, but control of a vast water highway, as well: Lake Champlain provided a direct invasion route to British Canada. However, had the British controlled the lake, they could have divided the colonies of [[New England]] and further depleted the [[Continental Army]].\n\nThe Continental Army's first offensive action took place in May 1775, three weeks after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcmm.org/shipwrecks_history/history/history_revolution.htm|title=History of Lake Champlain: Revolutionary War|website=www.lcmm.org|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref>  [[Ethan Allen]], accompanied by 200 [[Green Mountain Boys]], was ordered to capture [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and retrieve supplies for the fight in Boston.

This ended the final British invasion of the northern states during the [[War of 1812]]. It was fought just prior to the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], and the American victory denied the British any leverage to demand exclusive control over the [[Great Lakes]] or territorial gains against the [[New England]] states.\n\nThree [[USS Lake Champlain|US Naval ships]] have been named after this battle: {{USS|Lake Champlain|CV-39}}, {{USS|Lake Champlain|CG-57}}, and a cargo ship used during [[World War I]].\n\nFollowing the [[War of 1812]], the U.S. Army began construction on \"[[Fort Blunder]]\", an unnamed fortification built at the northernmost end of Lake Champlain to protect against attacks from British Canada. Its nickname came from a surveying error: the initial phase of construction on the fort turned out to be taking place on a point {{convert|3/4|mi}} north of the Canada\u2013U.S. border. Once this error was spotted, construction was abandoned. Locals scavenged materials used in the abandoned fort for use in their homes and public buildings.\n\nBy the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the Canada\u2013U.S. border was adjusted northward to include the strategically important site of \"Fort Blunder\" on the US side.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DZIUBAN|first=STANLEY W.|date=1968|title=FORT BLUNDER: A Vignette of American History|journal=The Military Engineer|volume=60|issue=393|pages=46\u201348|issn=0026-3982|jstor=44557158}}</ref> In 1844, work was begun to replace the remains of the 1812-era fort with a massive new [[Third System]] masonry fortification, known as [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]].

The lake is an important eastern gateway to [[Iroquois Confederacy]] lands.\n\nThe lake was named after the [[France|French]] [[exploration|explorer]] [[Samuel de Champlain]], who encountered it in July 1609.<ref name=EB1911/> While the ports of [[Burlington, Vermont]], [[Port Henry, New York]], and [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]] today are primarily used by small craft, ferries, and lake cruise ships, they were of substantial commercial and military importance in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n===Colonial America and the Revolutionary War===\n[[File:Lac Champlain (Nouvelle-France) 1739.JPG|thumb|Map of ''Lac Champlain'', from ''Fort de Chambly'' up to ''Fort St-Fr\u00e9deric'' in ''Nouvelle France''.

In [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] times, Lake Champlain was used as a water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] valleys. Travelers found it easier to journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than go overland on unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads. The lake's northern tip at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule), is a short distance from [[Montreal]], Quebec. The southern tip at [[Whitehall (town), New York|Whitehall]] (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is a short distance from [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], and [[Albany, New York]].\n\nForts were built at [[Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]] ([[Fort St. Frederic]]) to control passage on the lake in colonial times. Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1775. During the Revolutionary War, the British and Americans conducted a frenetic shipbuilding race through the spring and summer of 1776, at opposite ends of the lake, and fought a significant naval engagement on October 11 at the [[Battle of Valcour Island]]. While it was a tactical defeat for the Americans, and the small fleet led by [[Benedict Arnold]] was almost destroyed, the Americans gained a strategic victory; the British invasion was delayed long enough so the approach of winter prevented the fall of these forts until the following year. In this period, the [[Continental Army]] gained strength and was victorious at [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]].\n\n==== Beginning of the Revolutionary War ====\nAt the start of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], British forces occupied the [[Champlain Valley]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Revolution|last=Countryman|first=Edward|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=4}}</ref>  However, it did not take long for rebel leaders to realize the importance of controlling Lake Champlain.

Thus, the colonial militias devised a plan to take control of the two forts and bring the guns back to the fight in Boston.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Lake Champlain Ferry.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Champlain Ferries|Charlotte Ferry]], Lake Champlain]]\nThe necessity of controlling the two forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point placed Lake Champlain as a strategic arena during the Revolutionary War. By taking control of these forts, Americans not only gained heavy artillery, but control of a vast water highway, as well: Lake Champlain provided a direct invasion route to British Canada. However, had the British controlled the lake, they could have divided the colonies of [[New England]] and further depleted the [[Continental Army]].\n\nThe Continental Army's first offensive action took place in May 1775, three weeks after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcmm.org/shipwrecks_history/history/history_revolution.htm|title=History of Lake Champlain: Revolutionary War|website=www.lcmm.org|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref>  [[Ethan Allen]], accompanied by 200 [[Green Mountain Boys]], was ordered to capture [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and retrieve supplies for the fight in Boston.

Burgoyne\u2019s army reached Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in late June 1777. During the night of July 5, the American forces fled Ticonderoga as the British took control of the fort. However, Burgoyne\u2019s southern campaign did not go uncontested.\n\nOn October&nbsp;7, 1777, American General [[Horatio Gates]], who occupied [[Battles of Saratoga|Bemis Heights]], met Burgoyne\u2019s army at the Second [[Battle of Freeman's Farm|Battle of Freeman\u2019s Farm]].<ref name=\":6\" />  At Freeman\u2019s Farm, Burgoyne\u2019s army suffered its final defeat and ended their invasion south into the colonies.

This ended the final British invasion of the northern states during the [[War of 1812]]. It was fought just prior to the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], and the American victory denied the British any leverage to demand exclusive control over the [[Great Lakes]] or territorial gains against the [[New England]] states.\n\nThree [[USS Lake Champlain|US Naval ships]] have been named after this battle: {{USS|Lake Champlain|CV-39}}, {{USS|Lake Champlain|CG-57}}, and a cargo ship used during [[World War I]].\n\nFollowing the [[War of 1812]], the U.S. Army began construction on \"[[Fort Blunder]]\", an unnamed fortification built at the northernmost end of Lake Champlain to protect against attacks from British Canada. Its nickname came from a surveying error: the initial phase of construction on the fort turned out to be taking place on a point {{convert|3/4|mi}} north of the Canada\u2013U.S. border. Once this error was spotted, construction was abandoned. Locals scavenged materials used in the abandoned fort for use in their homes and public buildings.\n\nBy the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the Canada\u2013U.S. border was adjusted northward to include the strategically important site of \"Fort Blunder\" on the US side.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DZIUBAN|first=STANLEY W.|date=1968|title=FORT BLUNDER: A Vignette of American History|journal=The Military Engineer|volume=60|issue=393|pages=46\u201348|issn=0026-3982|jstor=44557158}}</ref> In 1844, work was begun to replace the remains of the 1812-era fort with a massive new [[Third System]] masonry fortification, known as [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]].
