Others broke into a dive and entered a horizontal turning engagement with their pursuers who held an advantage in horizontal turn-rate allowing them to engage with guns shooting down more of the PRC jets.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.\n\n27 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1\nTwo F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran. They were brought down with AIM-9 and AIM-7 missiles after a brief dogfight.\n\n29 January 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn American F-15C shot down a MiG-23 fleeing to Iran with an AIM-7 missile.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nA USAF F-15C eliminates an Iraqi MiG-23 in a short-lived dogfight with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n2 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF IL-76\nAn F-15C kills an Iraqi transport, an IL-76, that was parked by strafing it with 20&nbsp;mm bullets.\n\n6 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nA lone F-15C takes down two Iraqi MiG-21s with AIM-7 missiles after they both engage him.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.\n\n27 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1\nTwo F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran. They were brought down with AIM-9 and AIM-7 missiles after a brief dogfight.\n\n29 January 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn American F-15C shot down a MiG-23 fleeing to Iran with an AIM-7 missile.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nA USAF F-15C eliminates an Iraqi MiG-23 in a short-lived dogfight with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n2 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF IL-76\nAn F-15C kills an Iraqi transport, an IL-76, that was parked by strafing it with 20&nbsp;mm bullets.\n\n6 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nA lone F-15C takes down two Iraqi MiG-21s with AIM-7 missiles after they both engage him. These MiGs were escorting the Su-25s mentioned below.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Su-25s\nA F-15C spots two Iraqi Su-25s and gives chase, locking on, and shooting down both planes with AIM-9 missiles.\n\nUSAF A-10A vs. IRAF Bo-105\nA USAF A-10 ground attack aircraft, shoots down an Iraqi Bo-105 helicopter using its GAU-8 30&nbsp;mm cannon.\n\n7 February 1991\nUSN F-14 vs. IRAF Mi-8\nA USN F-14 shoots down an IRAF Mi-8 helicopter with an AIM-9 missile. It is the last USN F-14 air-to-air kill.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Su-22s and Su-7\nTwo USAF F-15Cs shoot down two IRAF Su-22s and one Su-7 as they attempt to flee Iraq. All with AIM-7 missiles.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mil-24\nA F-15C shoots down an IRAF Mi-24 with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n11 February 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF helicopters\nTwo F-15Cs shoot down two unidentified Iraqi helicopters by using AIM-7 missiles for both.\n\n14 February 1991\nUSAF F-15E vs. IRAF Hughes 500\nAn F-15E Strike Eagle fighter/bomber dropped a laser-guided bomb onto a Hughes 500 helicopter in the air. The helicopter was on the ground initially loading up commandos, though it took off. Even with it taking off they left the laser on it and the bomb hit it when it was \"200 or so\" feet in the air. A special forces team on the ground witnessed the event.\n\n15 February 1991\nUSAF A-10A vs. IRAF Mi-8\nAn A-10A ground attack aircraft shoots down an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter with its GAU-8 30&nbsp;mm cannon.\n\n===Iraqi no-fly zones (1991\u20132003)===\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]] 20 March 1991 \u2013 USAF F-15C vs. IRAF Su-22 \u2013 In accordance with the ceasefire, an F-15C shoots down an Iraqi Su-22 bomber with an AIM-9 missile.\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]]27 December 1992 \u2013 USAF F-16 vs. IRAF MiG-25 \u2013 A MiG-25 crossed the no-fly zone and an F-16D shot it down with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

M. Kaye]], published in 1978, which tells the story of an English officer during the [[British Raj]]. There are many parallels between this novel and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' that was published in 1900: the settings, the young English boy raised as a native by an Indian surrogate mother, \"[[the Great Game]]\" as it was played by the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Russia]]. The novel, rooted deeply in the [[romantic epic]]s of the 19th century, has been hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling. It is based partly on biographical writings of the author's grandfather as well as her knowledge of and childhood experiences in India. It has sold millions of copies, caused travel agents to create tours that visited the locations in the book, and inspired a television adaptation and a musical play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-02-04-author-kaye-dies_x.htm |title='Far Pavilions' author M.M.

His mother dies from [[childbed fever]] shortly after his birth and his father dies of [[cholera]] a few years later. He is entrusted to his [[Hindu]] ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]'' (nanny) Sita to be brought to his English relatives in the city of [[Mardan]]. After discovering that all English ''feringhis'' have been killed during the uprising, Sita adopts the dark-skinned Ash and takes him in search of safety.\n\nThey eventually find refuge in the kingdom of Gulkote where Ashton, now going by the name Ashok, forgets his English parentage and grows up as a native Indian boy. While working as a servant for Lalji, the young ''yuveraj'' (crown prince) of Gulkote, Ashton befriends the neglected princess Anjuli, in addition to the master of stables, Koda Dad, and his son Zarin. At the age of 11, Ashton uncovers a murderous conspiracy against Lalji and learns he himself will be killed for interfering with the plot. Promising Anjuli he will return for her one day, he and Sita escape the palace with assistance from friends Sita and Ashok have made within the palace over the years, and flee from Gulkote. The ailing Sita dies en route, but not before revealing to Ash his true parentage and entrusting him with the letters and money his father gave her before his death.\n\nAshok makes his way to the military division Sita instructed him about, and they recognise him; now known by his English name, Ashton is turned over to English authorities and sent to England for a formal education and military training. At age 19, Ashton returns to India as an officer in the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]] with Zarin on the Northern Frontier. He quickly finds that his sense of place is torn between his newfound status as Ashton, an English \"[[sahib]]\", and Ashok, the native Indian boy he once believed he was.\n\nAfter going [[AWOL#Absence without leave|AWOL]] in Afghanistan (to restore the honour of his soldiers, penalized for losing weapons to border raiders) Ash is suspended from The Guides and sent to escort a royal wedding party across India. The party is in fact from the former kingdom of Gulkote, now known as Karidkote after merging with a neighbouring princedom, and Anjuli and her sister Shushila are the princesses to be married. Also in the wedding party is Anjuli's younger brother, the prince Jhoti. After revealing himself as Ashok to Anjuli, Ash falls in love with her, but is unable to act on his feelings as she is not only betrothed to another but belongs to what is now an alien culture, across a divide which they can no longer bridge. Over the months that follow, Ash thwarts a plot to murder Jhoti, and falls into increasing despair over his unrequited love for Anjuli. While caught in a dust storm together, Anjuli reveals her love for Ash, but rebuffs his pleas to run away with him out of duty to her sister as a co-bride in an arranged marriage. Ash is forced to watch Anjuli be married off to the lecherous rana of Bhithor and return to his duties in the military.\n\nTwo years later, Ash receives distressing news that the ''[[rana (title)|rana]]'' of Bhithor is dying, and that his wives are to be burned alive in the Hindu ritual of ''[[Sati (practice)|suttee]]''. Racing to Bhithor, Ash and his friends manage to rescue Anjuli and take her to safety; this rescue results in the death of not only Ash's beloved horse but also most of the human members of the party. He insists upon marrying Anjuli, despite the insistence of all other members of his group of acquaintances, including Anjuli, that this is not only unnecessary but against God's Law.\n\nHere the book's focus shifts from the relationship between Ash and Anjuli to England's and Russia's political wrangling in the regions north of what were the Indian borders at the time. In England's desire to expand its territory into Afghanistan, Ash is sent into the country as a spy to relay information that will help England establish a permanent foothold in the area. What follows is an account of the first phase of the [[Second Afghan War]], culminating in the September 1879 uprising that killed the English envoy in [[Kabul]]. This part of the story is told mostly from the perspective of Ash's best friend Walter \"Wally\" Hamilton.\n\nAfter the uprising in Kabul, Ash and Anjuli set out in search of a paradise in the Himalayas \u2013 \"the far pavilions\" \u2013 free of prejudice where they can live out their lives in peace.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''The Far Pavilions'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n==Characters in ''The Far Pavilions''==\n* Ashton Hillary Akbar (Ashok) Pelham-Martyn\n* Anjuli-Bai\n* Koda Dad Khan\n* Biju Ram\n* Mrs. Viccary\n* Shushila-Bai\n* Belinda Harlowe\n* Kaka-ji Rao\n* [[Walter Richard Pollock Hamilton|Walter Hamilton]]\n* Zarin Khan\n* Sita\n* Lalji\n* Captain Stiggins\n* Jhoti\n* [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Cavagnari]]\n* Wigram Battye\n\n==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==\n===Miniseries===\nFor [[HBO]] and [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and first screened in 1984 in the UK, [[Peter Duffell]] directed a five-hour three-part television [[miniseries]] based on the novel, starring [[Ben Cross]] as Ashton, [[Amy Irving]] as Anjuli, [[Omar Sharif]] as Koda Dad and [[Christopher Lee]] as Kaka-ji Rao.

M. Kaye]], published in 1978, which tells the story of an English officer during the [[British Raj]]. There are many parallels between this novel and [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' that was published in 1900: the settings, the young English boy raised as a native by an Indian surrogate mother, \"[[the Great Game]]\" as it was played by the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Russia]]. The novel, rooted deeply in the [[romantic epic]]s of the 19th century, has been hailed as a masterpiece of storytelling. It is based partly on biographical writings of the author's grandfather as well as her knowledge of and childhood experiences in India. It has sold millions of copies, caused travel agents to create tours that visited the locations in the book, and inspired a television adaptation and a musical play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-02-04-author-kaye-dies_x.htm |title='Far Pavilions' author M.M.

His mother dies from [[childbed fever]] shortly after his birth and his father dies of [[cholera]] a few years later. He is entrusted to his [[Hindu]] ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]'' (nanny) Sita to be brought to his English relatives in the city of [[Mardan]]. After discovering that all English ''feringhis'' have been killed during the uprising, Sita adopts the dark-skinned Ash and takes him in search of safety.\n\nThey eventually find refuge in the kingdom of Gulkote where Ashton, now going by the name Ashok, forgets his English parentage and grows up as a native Indian boy. While working as a servant for Lalji, the young ''yuveraj'' (crown prince) of Gulkote, Ashton befriends the neglected princess Anjuli, in addition to the master of stables, Koda Dad, and his son Zarin. At the age of 11, Ashton uncovers a murderous conspiracy against Lalji and learns he himself will be killed for interfering with the plot. Promising Anjuli he will return for her one-day, he and Sita escape the palace with assistance from friends Sita and Ashok have made within the palace over the years, and flee from Gulkote. The ailing Sita dies en route, but not before revealing to Ash his true parentage and entrusting him with the letters and money his father gave her before his death.\n\nAshok makes his way to the military division Sita instructed him about, and they recognise him; now known by his English name, Ashton is turned over to English authorities and sent to England for a formal education and military training. At age 19, Ashton returns to India as an officer in the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]] with Zarin on the Northern Frontier. He quickly finds that his sense of place is torn between his new-found status as Ashton, an English \"[[sahib]]\", and Ashok, the native Indian boy he once believed he was.\n\nAfter going [[AWOL#Absence without leave|AWOL]] in Afghanistan (to restore the honour of his soldiers, penalized for losing weapons to border raiders) Ash is suspended from The Guides and sent to escort a royal wedding party across India. The party is in fact from the former kingdom of Gulkote, now known as Karidkote after merging with a neighbouring princedom, and Anjuli and her sister Shushila are the princesses to be married. Also in the wedding party is Anjuli's younger brother, the prince Jhoti. After revealing himself as Ashok to Anjuli, Ash falls in love with her, but is unable to act on his feelings as she is not only betrothed to another but belongs to what is now an alien culture, across a divide which they can no longer bridge. Over the months that follow, Ash thwarts a plot to murder Jhoti, and falls into increasing despair over his unrequited love for Anjuli. While caught in a dust-storm together, Anjuli reveals her love for Ash, but rebuffs his pleas to run away with him out of duty to her sister as a co-bride in an arranged marriage. Ash is forced to watch Anjuli be married off to the lecherous rana of Bhithor and return to his duties in the military.\n\nTwo years later, Ash receives distressing news that the ''[[rana (title)|rana]]'' of Bhithor is dying, and that his wives are to be burned alive in the Hindu ritual of ''[[Sati (practice)|suttee]]''. Racing to Bhithor, Ash and his friends manage to rescue Anjuli and take her to safety; this rescue results in the death of not only Ash's beloved horse but also most of the human members of the party. He insists upon marrying Anjuli, despite the insistence of all other members of his group of acquaintances, including Anjuli, that this is not only unnecessary but against God's Law.\n\nHere the book's focus shifts from the relationship between Ash and Anjuli to England's and Russia's political wrangling in the regions north of what were the Indian borders at the time. In England's desire to expand its territory into Afghanistan, Ash is sent into the country as a spy to relay information that will help England establish a permanent foothold in the area. What follows is an account of the first phase of the [[Second Afghan War]], culminating in the September 1879 uprising that killed the English envoy in [[Kabul]]. This part of the story is told mostly from the perspective of Ash's best friend Walter \"Wally\" Hamilton.\n\nAfter the uprising in Kabul, Ash and Anjuli set out in search of a paradise in the Himalayas \u2013 \"the far pavilions\" \u2013 free of prejudice where they can live out their lives in peace.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''The Far Pavilions'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n==Characters in ''The Far Pavilions''==\n* Ashton Hillary Akbar (Ashok) Pelham-Martyn\n* Anjuli-Bai\n* Koda Dad Khan\n* Biju Ram\n* Mrs. Viccary\n* Shushila-Bai\n* Belinda Harlowe\n* Kaka-ji Rao\n* [[Walter Richard Pollock Hamilton|Walter Hamilton]]\n* Zarin Khan\n* Sita\n* Lalji\n* Captain Stiggins\n* Jhoti\n* [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Cavagnari]]\n* Wigram Battye\n\n==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==\n===Miniseries===\nFor [[HBO]] and [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and first screened in 1984 in the UK, [[Peter Duffell]] directed a five-hour three-part television [[miniseries]] based on the novel, starring [[Ben Cross]] as Ashton, [[Amy Irving]] as Anjuli, [[Omar Sharif]] as Koda Dad and [[Christopher Lee]] as Kaka-ji Rao.

''The Guardian'', 6 May 2005</ref> Tracks could be featured in consecutive weeks in different formats. For example, if a song was played over the chart countdown or the closing credits, then it was acceptable for the act to appear in the studio the following week.\n\nThese rules were sometimes interpreted flexibly and were more formally relaxed from 1997 when records descending the charts were featured more regularly, possibly as a response to the changing nature of the Top 40 (in the late 1990s and early 2000s climbers in the charts were a rarity, with almost all singles peaking at their debut position).\n\nWhen the programme's format changed in November 2003, it concentrated increasingly on the top 10. Later, during the BBC Two era, the top 20 was regarded as the main cut-off point, with the exception made for up and coming bands below the top 20. Singles from below the top 40 (within the top 75) were shown if the band were up and coming or had a strong selling album. If a single being performed was below the top 40, just the words \"New Entry\" were shown and not the chart position.\n\nThe show was originally intended to run for only a few programmes but lasted over 42 years, reaching landmark episodes of 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 in the years 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/06_june/20/totp.shtml|title=BBC says fond farewell to the world's longest running weekly music show, Top of the Pops|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> 1983,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=1454|title=1000th Top of the Pops|publisher=Information Britain|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 1992 and 2002<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2255885.stm|title=Top of the Pops 2000th show: Your views|work=BBC News|date=1 October 2002|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> respectively.\n\n===The first show===\n''Top of the Pops'' was first broadcast on Wednesday, 1{{nbsp}}January 1964 at 6:35&nbsp;pm.

These features were dropped after a while, although the programme continued to feature new releases on a regular basis for the rest of the decade.\n\nDuring its heyday, it attracted 15 million viewers each week.

Guest co-presenters and a music news feature were introduced for a short while, but had ceased by the end of 1980. The chart rundown was split into three sections in the middle of the programme, with the final Top 10 section initially featuring clips of the songs' videos, although this became rarer over the next few years. An occasional feature showing the American music scene with [[Jonathan King]] was introduced in November 1981, and ran every few weeks until February 1985. In January 1985, a ''Breakers'' section, featuring short video clips of new tracks in the lower end of the Top 40, was introduced, and this continued for most weeks until March 1994.\n\nAlthough the programme had been broadcast live in its early editions, it had been recorded on the day before transmission for many years. However, from May 1981, the show was sometimes broadcast live for a few editions each year, and this practice continued on an occasional basis (often in the week of a bank holiday, when the release of the new chart was delayed, and for some special editions) for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe programme moved in September 1985 to a new regular half-hour timeslot of 7&nbsp;pm on Thursdays, where it would remain until June 1996.\n\nThe end of 1988 was marked by a special 70-minute edition of the show broadcast on 31 December 1988, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first show. The pre-recorded programme featured the return of the original four presenters (Savile, Freeman, Murray and Jacobs) as well as numerous presenters from the show's history, anchored by [[Paul Gambaccini]] and [[Mike Read]]. Numerous clips from the history of the show were included in between acts performing in the studio, which included [[Cliff Richard]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[the Four Tops]], [[David Essex]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Shakin' Stevens]], [[the Tremeloes]] and from the very first edition, [[the Swinging Blue Jeans]]. [[Sandie Shaw]], [[the Pet Shop Boys]] and [[Wet Wet Wet]] were billed in the ''Radio Times'' to appear, but none featured in the show other than Shaw in compilation clips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/3eff4cfc1ae3406cafba406552792a77 |title=25 Years of Top of the Pops \u2013 BBC One London \u2013 31 December 1988 \u2013 BBC Genome |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaul Ciani took over as producer in 1988. The following year, in an attempt to fit more songs in the allocated half-hour, he restricted the duration of studio performances to three minutes, and videos to two minutes, a practice which was largely continued until May 1997. In July 1990, he introduced a rundown of the Top{{nbsp}}5 albums, which continued on a monthly basis until May 1991. Ciani had to step down due to illness in 1991, when Hurll returned as producer to cover for two months (and again for a brief time as holiday cover in 1992).\n\n===1991: 'Year Zero' revamp===\nFrom 1967, the show had become closely associated with the BBC radio station Radio 1, usually being presented by DJs from the station, and between 1988 and 1991 the programme was simulcast on the radio station in FM stereo. However, during the last few years of the 1980s the association became less close, and was severed completely (although not permanently) in a radical shake-up known as the 'Year Zero' revamp.\n\nFollowing a fall in viewing figures and a general perception that the show had become 'uncool' (acts like [[the Clash]] had refused to appear in the show in previous years), a radical new format was introduced by incoming executive producer [[Stanley Appel]] (who had worked on the programme since 1966 as cameraman, production assistant, director and stand-in producer<ref>{{cite news|author=Interviews by Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/04/how-we-made-top-of-the-pops?CMP=twt_fd |title=How we made Top of the Pops &#124; Television & radio |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>) in October 1991, in which the Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs were replaced by a team of relative unknowns, such as Claudia Simon and [[Tony Dortie]] who had previously worked for [[Children's BBC]], 17-year-old local radio DJ Mark Franklin, Steve Anderson, Adrian Rose and Elayne Smith, who was replaced by [[Femi Oke]] in 1992. A brand new theme tune ('Now Get Out of That'), title sequence and logo were introduced, and the entire programme moved from [[BBC Television Centre]] in London to [[Elstree Studios#Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood|BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Borehamwood]].\n\nThe new presenting team would take turns hosting (initially usually in pairs but sometimes solo), and would often introduce acts in an out-of-vision voiceover over the song's instrumental introduction. They would sometimes even conduct short informal interviews with the performers, and initially the Top 10 countdown was run without any voiceover. Rules relating to performance were also altered meaning acts had to sing live as opposed to the backing tracks for instruments and mimed vocals for which the show was known. To incorporate the shift of dominance towards American artists, more use was made of out-of-studio performances, with acts in America able to transmit their song to the Top of the Pops audience \"via satellite\". These changes were widely unpopular and much of the presenting team were axed within a year, leaving the show hosted solely by Dortie and Franklin (apart from the Christmas Day editions, when both presenters appeared) from October 1992, on a week-by-week rotation.\n\n===1994\u20131997===\nBy 1994, much of the 'Year Zero' revamp was quickly undone and the arrival of [[Ric Blaxill]] as producer in February 1994 signalled a return to presentation from established Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs [[Simon Mayo]], [[Mark Goodier]], [[Nicky Campbell]] and [[Bruno Brookes]]. Blaxill expanded the use of \"via satellite\" performances, taking the acts out of studios and concert halls and setting them against landmark backdrops. As a consequence, [[Bon Jovi]] performed ''Always'' from [[Niagara Falls]] and [[Celine Dion]] beamed in ''[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]'' from Miami Beach.\n\nThe last remnants of the Year Zero revamp were replaced in 1995, when a new title sequence, logo and theme tune were introduced (the logo having first been introduced on the new programme ''[[Top of the Pops 2]]'' some months previous), coinciding with the introduction of a new set. Blaxill also increasingly experimented with handing presenting duties to celebrities, commonly contemporary comedians and pop stars who were not in the charts at that time. In an attempt to keep the links between acts as fresh as the performances themselves, the so-called \"golden mic\" was used by, amongst others, [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Des Lynam]], [[Chris Eubank]], [[Damon Albarn]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Jack Dee]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]]. Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs still presented occasionally, notably [[Lisa I'Anson]], [[Steve Lamacq]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].\n\n''TOTP'' was traditionally shown on a Thursday night, but was moved to a Friday starting on 14 June 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/20/broadcasting|title=Top of the Pops' timeline|work=The Guardian|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> originally at 7&nbsp;pm, but then shifted to 7.30&nbsp;pm, a change which placed the programme up against the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

The team was later augmented by [[Kate Thornton]] and [[Gail Porter]].\n\nChris Cowey in particular instigated a set of 'back to basics' changes when he took over the show. In 1998, a remixed version of the classic 'Whole Lotta Love' theme tune previously used in the 1970s was introduced, accompanied by a new 1960s-inspired logo and title sequence. Cowey also began to export the brand overseas with localised versions of the show on air in Germany, France, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and Italy by 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arabic Top of the Pops is a hit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2771073.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> Finally, the programme returned to its previous home of [[BBC Television Centre]] in 2001, where it remained until its cancellation in 2006.\n\n===2003: ''All New Top of the Pops''===\nOn 28 November 2003 (three months after the appointment of [[Andi Peters]] as executive producer), the show saw one of its most radical overhauls since the ill-fated 1991 'Year Zero' revamp in what was widely reported as a make-or-break attempt to revitalise the long-running series. In a break with the previous format, the show played more up-and-coming tracks ahead of any chart success, and also featured interviews with artists and a music news feature called \"24/7\". Most editions of the show were now broadcast live, for the first time since 1991 (apart from a couple of editions in 1994). The launch show, which was an hour long, was notable for a performance of \"[[Flip Reverse]]\" by [[Blazin' Squad]], featuring hordes of hooded teenagers choreographed to dance around the outside of [[BBC Television Centre]].\n\nAlthough the first edition premi\u00e8red to improved ratings, the ''All New'' format, hosted by [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] presenter [[Tim Kash]], quickly returned to low ratings and brought about scathing reviews.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/lets-kill-top-of-the-pops-575378.html Let's kill ''Top of the Pops''], ''[[The Independent]]'', 2 December 2003</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3253136.stm Your reviews: ''Top of the Pops''], BBC News, 1{{nbsp}}December 2003</ref> Kash continued to host the show, but Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs [[Reggie Yates]] and [[Fearne Cotton]] (who had each presented a few shows in 2003, before the revamp) were brought back to co-host alongside him, before Kash was completely dropped by the BBC, later taking up a new contract at MTV. The show continued to be hosted by [[Reggie Yates]] and Fearne Cotton (usually together, but occasionally solo) on Friday evenings until 8{{nbsp}}July 2005.\n\nOn 30 July 2004, the show took place outside a studio environment for the first time by broadcasting outside in [[Gateshead]].

At the time, it was insisted that this was so the show would air immediately after the official announcement of the new top 40 chart on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], as it was thought that by the following Friday, the chart seemed out of date. The final ''Top of the Pops'' to be shown on BBC One (barring Christmas and New Year specials) was broadcast on Monday 11 July 2005, which was edition number 2,166.\n\nThe first edition on BBC Two was broadcast on 17 July 2005 at 7.00&nbsp;pm with presenter Fearne Cotton. After the move to Sundays, Cotton continued to host with a different guest presenter each week, such as [[Rufus Hound]] or [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]]. On a number of occasions, however, [[Reggie Yates]] would step in, joined by female guest presenters such as [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] and [[Anastacia]]. Viewing figures during this period averaged around 1\u00bd million.

[[Edith Bowman]] co-presented its hour-long swansong, along with [[Jimmy Savile]] (who was the main presenter on the first show), [[Reggie Yates]], [[Mike Read]], [[Pat Sharp]], [[Sarah Cawood]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Rufus Hound]], [[Tony Blackburn]] and [[Janice Long]].\n\nThe final day of recording was 26 July 2006<ref>[http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LMEI468T ''TOTP: The Final Countdown'' (Rec:2006-07-26 Tx:2006-07-30)], ''BBC Programme Catalogue''</ref> and featured archive footage and tributes, including [[the Rolling Stones]] \u2013 the very first band to appear on ''Top of the Pops'' \u2013 opening with \"The Last Time\", the [[Spice Girls]], [[David Bowie]], [[Wham!]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Gnarls Barkley]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[Sonny and Cher]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. The show closed with a final countdown, topped by [[Shakira]], as her track \"[[Hips Don't Lie]]\" (featuring [[Wyclef Jean]]) had climbed back up to number one on the UK Singles Chart earlier in the day. The show ended with Savile ultimately turning the lights off in the empty studio.\n\nFearne Cotton, who was the current presenter, was unavailable to co-host for the final edition due to her filming of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island]]'' in [[Fiji]] but opened the show with a quick introduction recorded on location, saying \"It's still number one, it's ''Top of the Pops''\".

However, the ''TOTP'' website, which the BBC had originally promised would continue, is now no longer updated, although many of the old features of the site \u2013 interviews, music news, reviews \u2013 have remained, now in the form of the Radio 1-affiliated TOTP ChartBlog accessible via the remains of the old website.\n\n====Calls for its return====\nIn October 2008, British [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Andy Burnham]] and [[Manchester]] indie band [[the Ting Tings]] called for the show to return.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/the-ting-tings/40496 The Tings Tings: \"Bring back ''Top of the Pops''\"], ''[[NME]]'', 17 October 2008</ref>\n\nOn 29 October 2008, [[Simon Cowell]] stated in an interview that he would be willing to buy the rights to ''Top of the Pops'' from the BBC. The corporation responded that they had not been formally approached by Cowell,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7699262.stm Cowell wants to take ''TOTP'' to ITV], BBC News, 30 October 2008</ref> and that in any case the format was \u201cnot up for sale\".<ref name=\"xmas08\"/> In November 2008, it was reported by ''[[The Times]]'' and other newspapers that the weekly programme was to be revived in 2009, but the BBC said there were no such plans.<ref>[http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1036181&c=1 BBC rules out TOTP return], ''[[Music Week]]'', 17 November 2008</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, [[Pet Shop Boys]] singer [[Neil Tennant]] criticised the BBC for ending the programme, stating that new acts were missing out on \"that great moment of being crowned that week's Kings of Pop\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8157548.stm \"Tennant slams BBC for ending TOTP\"], [[BBC News]], 18 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn early 2015 there was increased speculation of a return of the show including rumours that [[Dermot O'Leary]] might present alongside Fearne Cotton. According to a report in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', a BBC insider stated that \"some at the highest level are massive supporters of the plan [of a return] and have given the go-ahead.\"<ref name=\"mirror.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/top-pops-set-comeback-dermot-5546470|title=Top of the Pops set for comeback with Dermot O'Leary and Fearne Cotton as hosts|author=Nigel Pauley|date=18 April 2015|work=mirror}}</ref> The move of the UK charts to a Friday due to take place in summer 2015<ref>{{cite web|last=Charts |first=Official |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-chart-to-move-to-fridays-from-summer-2015__8748/ |title=The Official Chart to move to Fridays from summer 2015 |website=Officialcharts.com |date=23 March 2015 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> was also said to favour the possibility of a return, making it \"the perfect tie-in\"<ref name=\"mirror.co.uk\"/> and a \"perfect start to the weekend\",<ref name=\"mirror.co.uk\"/> but no weekly return has occurred.\n\n====BBC Four reruns====\nIn April 2011, the BBC began to reshow ''Top of the Pops'' on Thursday nights on [[BBC Four]] beginning with the equivalent show from 35 years earlier in a 7:30&nbsp;pm\u20138:00&nbsp;pm slot approximating to the time the programme was traditionally shown. The first programme shown, 1{{nbsp}}April 1976, was chosen because it was from approximately this episode onwards that most editions remain in the BBC archive. The repeat programmes come in two versions; the first is edited down to fit in the 30-minute 7:30 slot, the second is shown normally twice overnight in the following weekend, and is usually complete. However both the short and longer editions can be edited for a number of reasons. Potentially offensive content to modern audiences is cut (for example the Barron Knights' in-studio performance of \"Food For Thought\" on the edition of 13 December 1979 including a segment parodying Chinese takeaways using mannerisms that may now be viewed as offensive), and cinematic film footage can be truncated, replaced or removed entirely due to the costs to the BBC of reshowing such footage. The BBC also makes the repeats available on [[BBC iPlayer]]. The repeats are continuing as of January 2020 with episodes from 1989 & 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/30/top-of-the-pops-bbc4 |title=BBC4 rewinds Top of the Pops to 1976 |author=Jason Deans |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], from October 2012, episodes featuring Jimmy Savile ceased to be broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a435261/bbc-axes-jimmy-savile-top-of-the-pops-reruns.html |title=BBC axes Jimmy Savile 'Top of the Pops' reruns \u2013 TV News |work=Digital Spy |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Following the arrest of [[Dave Lee Travis]] by [[Operation Yewtree]] officers, and the subsequent prosecution, acquittal, retrial, further acquittal on all but one minor charge and failed appeal, episodes featuring Travis were also omitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dave-lee-travis-top-of-the-pops-1438197|title=Dave Lee Travis: Top of the Pops episode pulled after ex-Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJ's arrest by Jimmy Savile cops|publisher=Mirror News|first=Ben|last=Rankin|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> Episodes featuring [[Mike Smith (presenter)|Mike Smith]] are also not included in the run due to the presenter declining to sign licence extensions to permit rebroadcast.

This effectively replaced the annual Christmas edition of [[Top of the Pops 2]], which did not run that year.\n\n====Christmas and New Year specials====\nAlthough the weekly ''Top of the Pops'' has been cancelled, the Christmas Specials have continued, hosted by Fearne Cotton and [[Reggie Yates]]. The Christmas specials are broadcast on Christmas Day afternoon on BBC One.

The most recent festive edition of ''Top of the Pops'' was the New Year Special on 30 December 2019. A new logo and title sequence were introduced on the 2019 Christmas special. The BBC's Head of Music Television, Mark Cooper, continues to oversee the programme as executive producer, while Stephanie McWhinnie replaced Wood as producer with effect from Christmas 2011. On 4{{nbsp}}December 2017, Yates stepped down from hosting ''Top of the Pops'' due to comments he made regarding Jewish people and rappers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42231416|title=Reggie Yates leaves Top of the Pops after 'offensive' Jewish slur|date=21 November 2017|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref> The BBC later announced [[Clara Amfo]] as Yates' replacement, Amfo continues to hold the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42243189|title=Clara Amfo replaces Reggie Yates on TOTP|date=6 December 2017|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n====Comic Relief specials====\nThe show was given a one-off revival (of sorts) for [[Comic Relief]] 2007 in the form of ''[[Top Gear of the Pops]]'', presented by [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Richard Hammond]] and [[James May]]. It was filmed at the ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' aerodrome studio in [[Surrey]] on Sunday, 11 March 2007, although it bore little resemblance to the usual ''Top of the Pops'' format.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, ''Top of The Pops'' was once again revived, this time in its usual format, for a special live [[Comic Relief]] edition, airing on BBC Two while the main telethon took a break for the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' on BBC One. As with the Christmas specials the show was presented by Radio{{nbsp}}1 duo Fearne Cotton and [[Reggie Yates]] with special guest presenter [[Noel Fielding]] and appearances from [[Dawn French]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Claudia Winkleman]], [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Davina McCall]] (dancing in the audience and later as a Flo Rida dancer with Claudia Winkleman and French and Saunders) and [[David Tennant]].\n\nLive performances \u2013 interspersed with Comic Relief appeal films \u2013 included acts such as [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Take That]], [[U2]], [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] and [[Flo Rida]] (that week's Number{{nbsp}}1). Kicking off the show was a performance from [[Rob Brydon]] and [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] in their [[Gavin & Stacey]] guises, feat. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Robin Gibb]] with \"(Barry) [[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", the Comic Relief single.\n\n==Performers, performances and presenters==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2011}}\n{{main|List of performers on Top of the Pops|List of performances on Top of the Pops|List of Top of the Pops presenters}}\n\nIn its extensive history, ''Top of the Pops'' has featured many artists, many of whom have appeared more than once on the show to promote many of their records.\n\n[[Green Day]] hold the record for the longest ''Top of the Pops'' performance: \"[[Jesus of Suburbia]]\" broadcast on 6{{nbsp}}November 2005, lasted 9{{nbsp}}minutes and 10 seconds. There is uncertainty about what was the shortest performance. In 2005, presenter Reggie Yates announced on the show that it was [[Super Furry Animals]] with \"[[Do or Die (Super Furry Animals song)|Do or Die]]\", broadcast on 28 January 2000, clocking in at 95 seconds. However, \"It's My Turn\" by [[Angelic (band)|Angelic]] was 91 seconds on 16 June 2000 and, according to an August 2012 edition of ''[[TOTP2]]'', \"[[Here Comes the Summer]]\" by [[the Undertones]] was just 84 seconds on 26 July 1979. [[Cliff Richard]] appeared the most times on the show, with almost 160 performances. [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] were the most frequent group with 106 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03j113z|title=BBC Two \u2013 TOTP2, Status Quo|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\n{{Main|Lip-syncing|Miming in instrumental performance}}\nInitially acts performing on the show [[lip-synching in music|mimed]] to the commercially released record, but in 1966 after discussions with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]], miming was banned.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Thompson, Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kzKOaaaCV-EC&pg=PA9&dq=%22top+of+the+pops%22+%22musicians+union%22+1966#v=onepage&q=%22top%20of%20the%20pops%22%20%22musicians%20union%22%201966&f=false|title=Please Please Me: Sixties British Pop, Inside Out|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|page=9|isbn=9780195333183}}</ref> After a few weeks during which some bands' attempts to play as well as on their records were somewhat lacking, a compromise was reached whereby a specially recorded [[backing track]] was permitted, as long as all the musicians on the track were present in the studio.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cripps|first=Charlotte|title=The Musicians' Union: Alive and well, playing by the book|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-musicians-union-alive-and-well-playing-by-the-book-8732216.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=26 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BedZ8B-7V0UC&pg=PT75&dq=%22top+of+the+pops%22+backing+track+musicians#v=onepage&q=%22top%20of%20the%20pops%22%20backing%20track%20musicians&f=false|title=The History of Live Music in Britain, Volume I: 1950\u20131967: From Dance Hall to the 100 Club|author1=Frith, Simon |author2=Brennan, Matt |author3=Cloonan, Martin |author4=Webster, Emma |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781472400291|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A famous example of this is the performance of \"[[All About Eve (album)|Martha's Harbour]]\" in 1988 by [[All About Eve (band)|All About Eve]] where the television audience at home could hear the song but the band and studio audience and personnel could not. As the opening verse of the song beamed out of the nation's television sets, the unknowing lead singer [[Julianne Regan]] remained silent on a stool on stage while [[Tim Bricheno]] (the only other band member present) did not play his guitar. An unseen stagehand apparently prompted them that something was wrong in time to mime along to the second verse. The band were invited back the following week, and chose to sing live.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAlso, [[Jimi Hendrix]] who, on hearing someone else's track being played by mistake (in the days of live broadcast), mumbled \"I don't know the words to that one, man\", [[Shane MacGowan]] of [[the Pogues]]' drunken performance of \"[[Fairytale of New York]]\", a performance of \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in which [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] and [[Liam Gallagher]] exchanged roles with Noel miming to Liam's singing track and Liam pretending to play guitar, and [[John Peel]]'s appearance as the [[mandolin]] soloist for [[Rod Stewart]] on \"[[Maggie May]]\". During their performance of \"Don't leave me this way\" [[Communards (band)|the Communards]] singers [[Jimmy Somerville]] and [[Sarah Jane Morris (singer)|Sarah Jane Morris]] swapped lyrics for part of the song towards the end.\n\nOccasionally bands played live, examples in the 1970s being [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]], [[the Who]], [[John Otway]], [[Sham 69]], [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]], [[Jimmy James and the Vagabonds]], [[Heavy Metal Kids]], [[Elton John]], [[Typically Tropical]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[David Bowie]]. In 1980, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] played live on the show when they refused to mime to their single \"Running Free\". Solo artists and vocal groups were supposed to sing live to the Top of the Pops Orchestra. [[Billy Ocean]], [[Brotherhood of Man]], [[Hylda Baker]] and [[the Nolans]] all performed in this way.\n\nFor a few years from 1991, the show adopted a live vocal to pre-recorded backing track policy. Performing \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] singer [[Kurt Cobain]] dropped his voice an octave and changed the opening line to \"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\"; the band also made it very clear that they were not playing their instruments. (Cobain later said during an interview that he wanted to sound more like [[Morrissey]] during the performance.)

From the edition of 7{{nbsp}}August 1980 to the edition of 2{{nbsp}}July 1981, \"Whole Lotta Love\" was heard only during the chart rundowns.\n* 9 July 1981 to 27 March 1986: \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\" was commissioned as the new theme music. From May 1983 to July 1984, a re-recording of \"Yellow Pearl\" was played over the chart rundown and a soft rock version from August 1984 to March 1986.\n* 3 April 1986 to 26 September 1991: \"[[The Wizard (Paul Hardcastle song)|The Wizard]]\", a composition by [[Paul Hardcastle]].\n* 3 October 1991 to 26 January 1995: \"Now Get Out of That\" composed by Tony Gibber.\n* 2 February 1995 to 8 August 1997 (except 27 June & 25 July 1997 and 15 August 1997 to 24 April 1998) and 10 October 1997: the theme was a track called \"Red Hot Pop\" composed by [[Vince Clarke]] of [[Erasure]].\n* 27 June and 25 July 1997 then 15 August 1997 to 24 April 1998 (except 10 October 1997): No theme tune; the opening of the first song of the episode was played under the titles and a song from the top 20 was played under the chart rundown.\n* 1 May 1998 to 21 November 2003: Updated, drum and bass version of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" by Ben Chapman.\n* 28 November 2003 to 30 July 2006 and until 2012 for ''TOTP2'' and Xmas specials: A remixed version of \"Now Get Out of That\" by Tony Gibber.\n* 25 December 2013 to present for ''Top of the Pops'' Christmas and New Year Specials: A mix of both the 1970s \"Whole Lotta Love\" theme and the 1998 remix.\n\n==Lost episodes==\nDue to the [[Wiping#BBC|BBC's former policy of deleting old programmes]], the vast majority of the episodes from the programme's history prior to 1976 have been lost, including any official recording of the only live appearance by [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/823988.stm|title=ENTERTAINMENT &#124; Unique Beatles recording lost|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nOf the first 500 episodes (1964\u201373), only about 20 complete recordings remain in the BBC archives, and the majority of these are from 1969 onwards. The earliest surviving footage dates from 26 February 1964, and consists of performances by [[Billy J. Kramer]] and the Dakotas and [[the Dave Clark Five]]. Some programmes exist only partially (largely performances that were either pre-recorded or re-used in later editions). There are also two examples of rehearsal footage, which are both from 1965, one which includes [[Alan Freeman]] introducing [[the Seekers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMprTCLmin8 |title=The Seekers \u2013 The Carnival Is Over \u2013 Rehearsal 1965 |via=YouTube |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> and another with [[Sandie Shaw]] rehearsing \"[[Long Live Love (Chris Andrews song)|Long Live Love]]\"\u2014both believed to be for the end-of-year Christmas Special. There are also cases of shows that exist only in their raw, unedited form. The oldest complete episode in existence was originally transmitted on [[Boxing Day]] in 1967 (only five complete recordings from the 1960s survive, two of which have mute presenter links). The most recent that is not held is dated 8{{nbsp}}September 1977. Most editions after this date exist in full, except a few 1981\u201385 episodes recorded live feature mute presenter links (These episodes were skipped on the BBC Four re-runs).\n\nSome off-air recordings, made by fans at home with a microphone in front of the TV speaker, exist in varying quality, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] performing a live version of \"Hey Joe\" in December 1966.\n\nSome segments of ''TOTP'' which have been wiped by the BBC do survive in some form owing to having been included in other programmes, either by the BBC itself or by foreign broadcasters. What was thought to be the only surviving footage of the Beatles on the programme, for instance, comes from its re-use in episode one of 1965 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/chase/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The Chase \u2013 Details|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Additionally a number of recordings are believed to exist in private collections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2251425.stm|title=Entertainment &#124; Lost glam rock tapes found|work=BBC News|date=11 September 2002|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> However, in 2019, an 11-second clip of the group's only live appearance on ''TOTP'', from 16 June 1966, was unearthed \u2013 this was recorded by a viewer using an [[8 mm film|8mm camera]] to film the live transmission on their television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47854806 |title=Clip of 'lost' Beatles Top of the Pops performance unearthed |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 April 2019 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 April 2019 }}</ref> Other individual but complete clips that have surfaced over recent years include The Hollies performing Bus Stop, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience playing both Purple Haze and The Wind Cries Mary.\n\nThanks to a deal between the BBC and German television network ZDF around the turn of the 1970s, several TOTP clips were sent over to be shown on Disco, a similar styled chart show. This meant that performances from the likes of The Kinks (Apeman), The Who (The Seeker) and King Crimson (Cat Food) still exist in German archives.\n\nTwo complete episodes from 1967 were discovered in a private collection in 2009, having been recorded at home on an early available open reel to reel video recorder. Whilst the tapes suffered from major damage and degradation of both sound and picture quality, one show featured Pink Floyd with original leader Syd Barrett performing See Emily Play, whilst the second contained Dave Davies singing his solo hit Death of a Clown.\n\nThe programme was forced off the air for several weeks by industrial action by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] in both 1974 and 1980.\n\n==Spin-offs==\n''Top of the Pops'' has a sister show called ''[[Top of the Pops 2|TOTP2]]'' which uses archive footage from as early as the late 1960s. It began on 17 September 1994. The early series were narrated by [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], before [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] took over as narrator. In summer 2004 BBC Two's controller, Roly Keating, announced that it was being \"rested\". Shortly after [[Dave (TV channel)|UKTV G2]] began showing re-edited versions of earlier programmes with re-recorded dialogue. Finally after a two-year break ''TOTP2'' returned to the BBC Two schedules for a new series on Saturday, 30 September 2006, in an evening timeslot. It was still narrated by Steve Wright and featured a mixture of performances from the ''TOTP'' archive and newly recorded performances. The first edition of this series featured new performances by [[Razorlight]] and [[Nelly Furtado]] recorded after the final episode of ''Top of the Pops''. In 2009 [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] took over as narrator.\n\nAired on [[BBC Radio 1]] between the mid-1990s and late 2001 was ''Top of the Pops: The Radio Show'' which went out every Sunday at 3&nbsp;pm just before the singles chart, and was presented by [[Jayne Middlemiss]] and [[Scott Mills]]. It later reappeared on the [[BBC World Service]] in May 2003 originally presented by [[Emma B]], where it continues to be broadcast weekly in an hourly format, now presented by Kim Robson and produced by former BBC World Service producer Alan Rowett.\n\nThe defunct channel [[Play UK]] created two spin offs; ''TOTP+ Plus'' and ''[[TOTP@Play]]'' (2000\u20132001) (until mid-2000, this show was called ''The Phone Zone'' and was a spin-off from BBC Two music series ''[[The O-Zone]]''). [[BBC Choice]] featured a show called ''TOTP The New Chart'' (5 December 1999 \u2013 26 March 2000) and on BBC Two ''TOTP+'' (8 October 2000 \u2013 26 August 2001) which featured the ''TOTP @ Play'' studio and presenters. This is not to be confused with the UK Play version of the same name. A more recent spin-off (now ended) was ''[[Top of the Pops Saturday]]'' hosted originally by [[Fearne Cotton]] and [[Simon Grant]], and its successor ''[[Top of the Pops Reloaded]]''. This was shown on Saturday mornings on BBC One and featured competitions, star interviews, video reviews and some ''Top of the Pops'' performances. This was aimed at a younger audience and was part of the [[CBBC]] Saturday morning line-up. This was to rival ''[[CD:UK]]'' at the same time on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\n==Send-ups==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n\nA number of performers have sent up the format in various ways. Mainly this has been performers who disliked the mime format of the show, often as a more effective protest against this rather than just refusing to appear.\n* When [[Fairport Convention]] appeared to promote their 1969 hit \"[[If You Gotta Go, Go Now|Si Tu Dois Partir]]\", drummer [[Dave Mattacks]] wore a T-shirt printed \"MIMING\".\n* When [[the Smiths]] appeared on the show to perform their single \"[[This Charming Man]]\", lead singer [[Morrissey]] was unhappy about having to lip-sync and so held a bunch of gladioli on the stage instead of a microphone.\n* In 1977, Australian punk band [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] appeared when their minor hit \"This Perfect Day\" made the lower reaches of the chart. Singer Chris Bailey deliberately mimed the lyrics out of time before continuing to sing after allowing the microphone to fall out of his hand. Meanwhile, guitarist Ed Kuepper stood stock still, staring blankly away from the camera whilst strumming intermittently at a fraction of the fast pace of the guitar on the record.\n* During their performance of \"[[Tom Hark]]\" in 1980, the drummer for [[the Piranhas]] used plastic fish instead of drum sticks.\n* Northern Irish punk band [[Stiff Little Fingers]] appeared a few times on the show and each time didn't take it seriously. Normally singer [[Jake Burns]] would pull silly faces and flirt with the camera while playing. Drummer [[Jim Reilly]] would purposely hit the drums in a repetitive manner that didn't match up with the song and at times would pull the drum kit apart before the song was finished. And once, while playing the song \"Just Fade Away\", Reilly played a [[bodhr\u00e1n]] rather than drums.\n* While performing their 1982 hit \"[[Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)]]\", the band [[Dexy's Midnight Runners]] were seen performing in front of a projection of the darts player with a similar sounding name [[Jocky Wilson]] instead of soul singer [[Jackie Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5140720 |title=h2g2 \u2013 Dexy's Midnight Runners \u2013 the Band \u2013 Edited Entry |publisher=BBC |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> Dexy's frontman [[Kevin Rowland]] later said in an interview that the use of the Jocky Wilson picture was his idea and not a mistake by the programme makers as is sometimes stated.<ref>{{cite news|author=Johnny Sharp |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/27/jocky-wilson-other-rock-myths?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Jocky Wilson said \u2013 and other rock myths &#124; Sport |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/09/artsfeatures.bbc |title=Performers share their Top of the Pops memories |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Frankie Goes To Hollywood]] performed one of the many 1984 performances of their hit \"[[Two Tribes]]\" with bassist [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]] playing drums whilst drummer [[Ped Gill]] played bass.\n* In the midst of a 1986 performance of their hit \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\", [[The Communards]]\" vocalists [[Jimmy Somerville]] and [[Sarah Jane Morris (singer)|Sarah Jane Morris]] began to sing each other's vocals, an especially ironic change given that Somerville's part was much higher than that of Morris.\n* After [[the Bluebells]]' hit \"[[Young at Heart (Bananarama song)|Young at Heart]]\" unexpectedly reached number one in 1993, nine years after the song's original release, the band reunited after having spent many years disbanded to play the song several times on the show where they parodied various other famous acts of the time such as [[Shabba Ranks]] and [[2 Unlimited]], one performance including lead singer Ken McCluskey pretending to play or scratch records on a \"Bluebells Disco\" DJ deck erected in front of the stage. The performance from 25 March is also remembered for an unusual camera technique where a camera was fixed to the bow of the violinist, Bobby Valentino, leading to several fast and humorous shots of the bow being used.\n* When [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] mimed to \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\" on ''Top of the Pops'' in 1994, one of the cello players from the symphony was replaced by rhythm guitarist [[Paul Arthurs|Bonehead]], who clearly had no idea how the instrument should be played. Towards the end of the song, he gave up the pretence and started using the bow to conduct. A woman plays his rhythm guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Q82WlLQS4 |title=YouTube |via=YouTube |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> On another occasion Liam walked away from the microphone and chewed gum during a 2005 performance of \"[[Lyla (song)|Lyla]]\".\n* [[Faith No More]] lead singer [[Mike Patton]] also showed he was obviously miming a performance by sticking his tongue out of the side of his mouth during close-up shots. Also, their 1997 performance of \"Ashes to Ashes\" on the show featured Robin Guy (of the band Sack Trick) on drums instead of their actual drummer. He apparently wore a \"Puffy\" mask as a joke in reference to Faith No More's actual drummer, Mike \"Puffy\" Bordin. Mike Patton can be seen giving Guy the finger during the performance, supposedly because the mask fell off (or was taken off on purpose) as soon as the performance started.\n* Singer [[Les Gray]] of [[Mud (band)|Mud]] went on stage to perform with a ventriloquist dummy during the performance of \"[[Lonely This Christmas]]\" and had the dummy lip-synch to the voice-over in the middle of the song.\n* During [[Mott the Hoople]]'s performance of their single \"[[Roll Away the Stone]]\" in 1973, drummer [[Dale Griffin]] plays with oversized drumsticks.\n* For [[Orbital (band)|Orbital's]] debut ''TOTP'' performance they just stood around, occasionally leaning forward to press a button on their sequencers. One of their machines had its power plug deliberately draped across it, to show the equipment wasn't even plugged in.\n* [[EMF (band)|EMF]] appeared on the show with one of the guitarists strumming along while wearing boxing gloves.\n* In [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s performance of \"[[Charmless Man]]\" in 1996, [[Dave Rowntree]] decided to play with oversized drumsticks, while [[Graham Coxon]] played a mini guitar.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSJ_9zqPwE YouTube \u2013 Broadcast Yourself] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730102317/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSJ_9zqPwE |date=30 July 2013 }}</ref>\n* In [[Green Day]]'s first ''Top of the Pops'' appearance in 1994, the band played the song \"[[Welcome to Paradise]]\". Frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] wore an otherwise plain white T-shirt with the phrase \"Who am I fooling anyway?\" handwritten on it, most likely a reference to his own miming during the performance. He could also be seen not playing his guitar during the instrumental bridge in the song.\n* The performance of \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]] and the [[Faces (band)|Faces]] featured [[John Peel]] miming on mandolin. Near the end of the song, Rod and the Faces begin to kick around a football. This is despite the fact that the music can be still heard playing in the background.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBUjdRKJifI YouTube \u2013 Broadcast Yourself] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043553/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBUjdRKJifI |date=26 June 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Eels (band)|Eels]] performed \"[[Novocaine for the Soul]]\" playing on toy instruments, which they then trashed.\n* [[The Cure]] were known for their abhorrence for miming their songs whilst on ''TOTP'' and on several occasions made it obvious they were not playing their parts \u2013 using such stunts as playing guitar left-handed, miming very badly out of synch and dressing their instruments up in clothes.\n* During \"[[Sing (Travis song)|Sing]]\" by [[Travis (band)|Travis]], a pie fight broke out which aped the music video of the song. Even though the members of the band got involved, the music still played in the background.\n* [[Ambient house]] group [[the Orb]] notably sat and played chess while an edited version of their 39:57-minute single \"[[Blue Room (The Orb song)|Blue Room]]\" played in the background.\n* [[Depeche Mode]]'s performance of \"[[Barrel of a Gun (Depeche Mode song)|Barrel of a Gun]]\" in 1997 featured famous Dutch photographer and director [[Anton Corbijn]] who mimed playing the drums. Also Tim Simenon (who produced the album the song appeared on) mimed playing keyboards along with Andy Fletcher.\n* When [[the Cuban Boys]] performed \"[[Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia]]\" at the end of 1999, a performance which was reportedly unbroadcast, the band wearing labcoats, covered in cobwebs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecubanboys.co.uk/cuban_cvi.htm |title=Cognoscenti Vs Intelligentsia |publisher=Cuban Boys |date=7 April 1999 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> The performance came during the song's peak in popularity, which grew extreme reactions, both positive and negative.\n* In [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s only appearance on the show, [[Kurt Cobain]] deliberately sang their 1991 hit \"[[Smells like Teen Spirit]]\" in a low monotonous voice (he later claimed to be impersonating Morrissey) and the guitarists waved their guitars around above their heads during the famous guitar intro of the song.\n* When the [[Boomtown Rats]] performed \"[[Rat Trap]]\" on the show, [[Bob Geldof]] mimed playing a candelabra with a saxophone mouthpiece over the opening saxophone part, rather than pretend to play an actual instrument, and seems to be deliberately over-exaggerating his movements. During the same performance the band ripped up pictures of [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] at the beginning of the song to celebrate having replaced \"[[Summer Nights (Grease song)|Summer Nights]]\" (from the soundtrack of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'') at number one.\n\n==International versions==\n===Europe===\nThe ''TOTP'' format was sold to [[RTL Television|RTL]] in Germany in the 1990s, and aired on Saturday afternoons. It was very successful for a long time, with a compilation album series and magazine. However, in 2006 it was announced that the German show would be ending. The Italian version (first broadcast on [[Rai 2]] and later on [[Italia 1]]) also ended in 2006. In February 2010 the show returned on Rai 2, and was broadcast for two seasons before being cancelled again in October 2011. The French version of the show ended by September 2006 on France 2. The Dutch version of the show continued to run on [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] until the end of December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnn.nl/page/pers/45090/TOP%20OF%20THE%20POPS%20NEDERLAND%20STOPT|title=TOP OF THE POPS NEDERLAND STOPT |accessdate=3 December 2006 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004745/http://www.bnn.nl/page/pers/45090/TOP%20OF%20THE%20POPS%20NEDERLAND%20STOPT |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> [[BBC Prime]] used to broadcast re-edited episodes of the BBC version, the weekend after it was transmitted in the UK. Ireland began transmitting ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1978 on [[RT\u00c92]]. This was the UK version being transmitted at the same time as on BBC. The broadcasts ceased in late 1993.\n\n===United States and Canada===\n''Top of the Pops'' had short-lived fame in the United States. In October 1987, the [[CBS]] television network decided to try an American version of the show. It was hosted by [[Nia Peeples]] and even showed performances from the BBC version of the programme. The show was presented on late Friday nights as part of ''[[The CBS Late Movie|CBS Late Night]]'', and lasted almost half a year.\n\nIn 2002, [[BBC America]] presented the BBC version of ''Top of the Pops'' as part of their weekend schedule. The network would get the episodes one week after they were transmitted in the UK. BBC America then tinkered with the show by cutting a few minutes out of each show and moving it to a weekday time slot.\n\nOn 23 January 2006, [[Lou Pearlman]] made a deal to bring ''Top of the Pops'' back to the airwaves in the United States. It was expected to be similar to the 1987 version, but it would also utilise the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]] music charts, most notably the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. It was supposed to be planned for a possible 2006 or 2007 launch, but with several lawsuits against Lou and his companies (which resulted in his conviction in 2008), as well as the cancellation of the UK version, the proposed US project never went forward. On 19 August 2006, [[VH1]] aired the UK series' final episode.\n\nThe United States had its own similar series, ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which aired nationally on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1957 to 1987 (although it would continue in first-run syndication until 1988 and end its run on [[USA Network|USA]] in 1989). Similar series also included ''[[Soul Train]]'' (1970\u20132006, featuring [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] artists), ''[[Club MTV]]'' (1986\u201392, featuring [[Dance Music]] acts; hosted by [[Downtown Julie Brown]], an alumnus of TOTP as part of the show's last dance troupe [[Zoo (dance troupe)|Zoo]]) and ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' (1980\u201388; like the early TOTP, it also used dance troupes).\n\nCanada's version of this (mostly of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[Soul Train]]'') was ''[[Electric Circus]]'' (1988\u20132003) on [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], which was also seen in the USA through [[Fuse (TV channel)#As MuchMusic USA|MuchMusic USA]]. It had a national chart (mostly of dance music and some pop) as well as live performances, and was based on a local late '70s programme in [[Toronto]] called ''[[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] Boogie''.\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe ''Top of the Pops'' brand has also been exported to [[New Zealand]] which for many years had to rely on music-video only shows to demonstrate its Top 20 (as well as the occasional season of the UK version of ''TOTP'') as the world's top acts considered New Zealand too far away from the major markets to visit regularly. This changed in 2002 when the New Zealand government suggested a voluntary New Zealand music quota on radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=1291784 |title=New Zealand music quota for radio \u2013 National \u2013 NZ Herald News |website=The New Zealand Herald |date=26 March 2002 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> (basically a threat that if the stations did not impose a quota themselves then one would be imposed on them). This worked and suddenly the amount of indigenous music played on radio stations increased, as did the number of New Zealand hits in the top 20. Therefore, a new version of a show like ''Top of the Pops'' became feasible for the first time, and the show was commissioned by [[Television New Zealand]]. The show was Executive Produced by David Rose, managing director and owner of Satellite Media and began in early 2004 with host Alex Behan. The hour-long show (as opposed to the 30-minute UK version) which is broadcast at 5&nbsp;pm on Saturdays on [[TV2 (New Zealand)]] contains a mixture of songs recorded on a sound stage in the Auckland CBD, as well as performances from the international versions of the show. The New Zealand Top 20 singles and Top 10 albums are also featured. Alex stayed as host for two years before Bede Skinner took over. Despite a popular fan base in early 2006 TVNZ announced that ''Top of the Pops'' has been axed and ideas for new music shows are currently being considered.\n\nFree-to-air music channel [[C4 (TV channel)|C4]] then picked up the UK version of ''Top of the Pops'' and aired it on Saturdays at 8&nbsp;pm with a repeat screening on Thursdays. However, since the weekly UK version was axed itself, this arrangement also ended.\n\n===Africa, Asia and the Middle East===\nAn edited version of the UK show was shown on [[BBC Prime]], the weekend after UK transmission.\n\nIn addition, a licensed version was shown on the [[United Arab Emirates]]-based [[MBC 2 (Middle East)|MBC{{nbsp}}2]] television channel. This version consisted of parts of the UK version, including the Top 10 charts, as well as live performances by [[Arabic pop music|Arabic pop]] singers.\n\n===Latin America===\nA complete version of the UK show was shown on [[Liv (Latin American TV channel)|People+Arts]], two weeks after the UK transmission.\n\nBrazilian network [[TV Globo]] aired a loosely based version of the original format in 2018, labeled as 'S\u00f3 Toca Top', hosted by singer [[Luan Santana]] and actress [[Fernanda Souza]].\n\n==Compilation albums==\nA number of compilation albums using the ''Top of the Pops'' brand have been issued over the years. The first one to reach the charts was ''BBC TV's The Best of Top of the Pops'' on the Super Beeb record label in 1975, which reached number 21 and in 1986 the BBC released ''The Wizard'' by Paul Hardcastle (the 1986-1990 Top of The Pops theme tune) on Vinyl under the BBC Records and Tapes banner.\n\nStarting in 1968 and carrying on through the 1970s a rival series of ''[[Top of the Pops (record series)|Top of the Pops]]'' albums were produced, however these had no connection with the television series except for its name. They were a series of budget [[cover version|cover]] albums of current chart hits recorded by anonymous session singers and musicians released on the Hallmark record label. They had initially reached the charts but were later disallowed due to a change in the criteria for entering the charts. These albums continued to be produced until the early 1980s, when the advent of compilation albums featuring the original versions of hits, such as the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series, led to a steep decline in their popularity.\n\nIn the 1990s, the BBC ''Top of the Pops'' brand was again licensed for use in a tie-in compilation series. Starting in 1995 with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music's]] [[Columbia Records]] label, these double disc collections moved to the special marketing arm of [[PolyGram]] / [[Universal Music Group]] TV, before becoming a sister brand of the ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' range in the [[EMI]] / [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] / Universal joint venture.\n\nSimilarly to the roles of ''Top of the Pops'' on BBC One and BBC Two in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the compilation albums range featured current hits for the main series and classic hits (such as '70s Rock) for the \"Top of the Pops 2\" spin-offs.\n\nThe ''Top of the Pops'' brand has now been licensed by EMI who released a compilation series in 2007\u201308, with one CD for each year that ''Top of the Pops'' was running.

The world's longest running weekly music show, TOTP was shown every Thursday evening on [[BBC One]], except for a short period on Fridays in mid-1973, and again in autumn 1974, before once again being moved to Fridays at 7:30&nbsp;pm from 1996 to 2005 and then to Sundays on BBC Two from 2005 till the last ever weekly show in 2006. Each weekly show consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling [[popular music]] records, usually excluding any tracks moving down the chart, including a rundown of that week's singles chart. This was originally the Top 20, changing to the Top 30 during the 1970s and the Top 40 in the 80s.

The show would include the highest new entry and (if not featured in the previous week) the highest climber on the charts, and omit any song going down in the chart.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">(2005). A record would not appear twice until it had made the Top 30. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/06/guardianobituaries.broadcasting \"Johnnie Stewart Television producer who put Top Of The Pops on top\"]. ''The Guardian'', 6 May 2005</ref> Tracks could be featured in consecutive weeks in different formats. For example, if a song was played over the chart countdown or the closing credits, then it was acceptable for the act to appear in the studio the following week.\n\nThese rules were sometimes interpreted flexibly and were more formally relaxed from 1997 when records descending the charts were featured more regularly, possibly as a response to the changing nature of the Top 40 (in the late 1990s and early 2000s climbers in the charts were a rarity, with almost all singles peaking at their debut position).\n\nWhen the programme's format changed in November 2003, it concentrated increasingly on the top 10. Later, during the BBC Two era, the top 20 was regarded as the main cut-off point, with the exception made for up and coming bands below the top 20. Singles from below the top 40 (within the top 75) were shown if the band were up and coming or had a strong selling album. If a single being performed was below the top 40, just the words \"New Entry\" were shown and not the chart position.\n\nThe show was originally intended to run for only a few programmes but lasted over 42 years, reaching landmark episodes of 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 in the years 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/06_june/20/totp.shtml|title=BBC says fond farewell to the world's longest running weekly music show, Top of the Pops|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> 1983,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=1454|title=1000th Top of the Pops|publisher=Information Britain|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 1992 and 2002<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2255885.stm|title=Top of the Pops 2000th show: Your views|work=BBC News|date=1 October 2002|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> respectively.\n\n===The first show===\n''Top of the Pops'' was first broadcast on Wednesday, 1{{nbsp}}January 1964 at 6:35&nbsp;pm.

Guest co-presenters and a music news feature were introduced for a short while, but had ceased by the end of 1980. The chart rundown was split into three sections in the middle of the programme, with the final Top 10 section initially featuring clips of the songs' videos, although this became rarer over the next few years. An occasional feature showing the American music scene with [[Jonathan King]] was introduced in November 1981, and ran every few weeks until February 1985. In January 1985, a ''Breakers'' section, featuring short video clips of new tracks in the lower end of the Top 40, was introduced, and this continued for most weeks until March 1994.\n\nAlthough the programme had been broadcast live in its early editions, it had been recorded on the day before transmission for many years. However, from May 1981, the show was sometimes broadcast live for a few editions each year, and this practice continued on an occasional basis (often in the week of a bank holiday, when the release of the new chart was delayed, and for some special editions) for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe programme moved in September 1985 to a new regular half-hour timeslot of 7&nbsp;pm on Thursdays, where it would remain until June 1996.\n\nThe end of 1988 was marked by a special 70-minute edition of the show broadcast on 31 December 1988, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first show. The pre-recorded programme featured the return of the original four presenters (Savile, Freeman, Murray and Jacobs) as well as numerous presenters from the show's history, anchored by [[Paul Gambaccini]] and [[Mike Read]]. Numerous clips from the history of the show were included in between acts performing in the studio, which included [[Cliff Richard]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[the Four Tops]], [[David Essex]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Shakin' Stevens]], [[the Tremeloes]] and from the very first edition, [[the Swinging Blue Jeans]]. [[Sandie Shaw]], [[the Pet Shop Boys]] and [[Wet Wet Wet]] were billed in the ''Radio Times'' to appear, but none featured in the show other than Shaw in compilation clips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/3eff4cfc1ae3406cafba406552792a77 |title=25 Years of Top of the Pops \u2013 BBC One London \u2013 31 December 1988 \u2013 BBC Genome |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaul Ciani took over as producer in 1988. The following year, in an attempt to fit more songs in the allocated half-hour, he restricted the duration of studio performances to three minutes, and videos to two minutes, a practice which was largely continued until May 1997. In July 1990, he introduced a rundown of the Top{{nbsp}}5 albums, which continued on a monthly basis until May 1991. Ciani had to step down due to illness in 1991, when Hurll returned as producer to cover for two months (and again for a brief time as holiday cover in 1992).\n\n===1991: 'Year Zero' revamp===\nFrom 1967, the show had become closely associated with the BBC radio station Radio 1, usually being presented by DJs from the station, and between 1988 and 1991 the programme was simulcast on the radio station in FM stereo. However, during the last few years of the 1980s the association became less close, and was severed completely (although not permanently) in a radical shake-up known as the 'Year Zero' revamp.\n\nFollowing a fall in viewing figures and a general perception that the show had become 'uncool' (acts like [[the Clash]] had refused to appear in the show in previous years), a radical new format was introduced by incoming executive producer [[Stanley Appel]] (who had worked on the programme since 1966 as cameraman, production assistant, director and stand-in producer<ref>{{cite news|author=Interviews by Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/04/how-we-made-top-of-the-pops?CMP=twt_fd |title=How we made Top of the Pops &#124; Television & radio |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>) in October 1991, in which the Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs were replaced by a team of relative unknowns, such as Claudia Simon and [[Tony Dortie]] who had previously worked for [[Children's BBC]], 17-year-old local radio DJ Mark Franklin, Steve Anderson, Adrian Rose and Elayne Smith, who was replaced by [[Femi Oke]] in 1992. A brand new theme tune ('Now Get Out of That'), title sequence and logo were introduced, and the entire programme moved from [[BBC Television Centre]] in London to [[Elstree Studios#Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood|BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Borehamwood]].\n\nThe new presenting team would take turns hosting (initially usually in pairs but sometimes solo), and would often introduce acts in an out-of-vision voiceover over the song's instrumental introduction. They would sometimes even conduct short informal interviews with the performers, and initially the Top 10 countdown was run without any voiceover. Rules relating to performance were also altered meaning acts had to sing live as opposed to the backing tracks for instruments and mimed vocals for which the show was known. To incorporate the shift of dominance towards American artists, more use was made of out-of-studio performances, with acts in America able to transmit their song to the Top of the Pops audience \"via satellite\". These changes were widely unpopular and much of the presenting team were axed within a year, leaving the show hosted solely by Dortie and Franklin (apart from the Christmas Day editions, when both presenters appeared) from October 1992, on a week-by-week rotation.\n\n===1994\u20131997===\nBy 1994, much of the 'Year Zero' revamp was quickly undone and the arrival of [[Ric Blaxill]] as producer in February 1994 signalled a return to presentation from established Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs [[Simon Mayo]], [[Mark Goodier]], [[Nicky Campbell]] and [[Bruno Brookes]]. Blaxill expanded the use of \"via satellite\" performances, taking the acts out of studios and concert halls and setting them against landmark backdrops. As a consequence, [[Bon Jovi]] performed ''Always'' from [[Niagara Falls]] and [[Celine Dion]] beamed in ''[[Think Twice (Celine Dion song)|Think Twice]]'' from Miami Beach.\n\nThe last remnants of the Year Zero revamp were replaced in 1995, when a new title sequence, logo and theme tune were introduced (the logo having first been introduced on the new programme ''[[Top of the Pops 2]]'' some months previous), coinciding with the introduction of a new set. Blaxill also increasingly experimented with handing presenting duties to celebrities, commonly contemporary comedians and pop stars who were not in the charts at that time. In an attempt to keep the links between acts as fresh as the performances themselves, the so-called \"golden mic\" was used by, amongst others, [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Des Lynam]], [[Chris Eubank]], [[Damon Albarn]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Jack Dee]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]]. Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs still presented occasionally, notably [[Lisa I'Anson]], [[Steve Lamacq]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].\n\n''TOTP'' was traditionally shown on a Thursday night, but was moved to a Friday starting on 14 June 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/20/broadcasting|title=Top of the Pops' timeline|work=The Guardian|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> originally at 7&nbsp;pm, but then shifted to 7.30&nbsp;pm, a change which placed the programme up against the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. This began a major decline in audience figures as fans were forced to choose between ''Top of the Pops'' and an episode of the soap.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Youngs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3234576.stm|title=Top of the Pops' all new gamble|work=BBC News|date=28 November 2003|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132003===\n[[File:Totp logo 1998.svg|thumb|right|Top of the Pops logo used from 1998 to 2003.]]\nIn 1997, incoming producer [[Chris Cowey]] phased out the use of celebrities and established a rotating team (similar to the 1991 revamp, although much more warmly received) of former presenters of youth music magazine ''[[The O-Zone]]'' [[Jayne Middlemiss]] and [[Jamie Theakston]] as well as Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Zo\u00eb Ball]]. The team was later augmented by [[Kate Thornton]] and [[Gail Porter]].\n\nChris Cowey in particular instigated a set of 'back to basics' changes when he took over the show. In 1998, a remixed version of the classic 'Whole Lotta Love' theme tune previously used in the 1970s was introduced, accompanied by a new 1960s-inspired logo and title sequence. Cowey also began to export the brand overseas with localised versions of the show on air in Germany, France, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and Italy by 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arabic Top of the Pops is a hit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2771073.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> Finally, the programme returned to its previous home of [[BBC Television Centre]] in 2001, where it remained until its cancellation in 2006.\n\n===2003: ''All New Top of the Pops''===\nOn 28 November 2003 (three months after the appointment of [[Andi Peters]] as executive producer), the show saw one of its most radical overhauls since the ill-fated 1991 'Year Zero' revamp in what was widely reported as a make-or-break attempt to revitalise the long-running series. In a break with the previous format, the show played more up-and-coming tracks ahead of any chart success, and also featured interviews with artists and a music news feature called \"24/7\". Most editions of the show were now broadcast live, for the first time since 1991 (apart from a couple of editions in 1994). The launch show, which was an hour long, was notable for a performance of \"[[Flip Reverse]]\" by [[Blazin' Squad]], featuring hordes of hooded teenagers choreographed to dance around the outside of [[BBC Television Centre]].\n\nAlthough the first edition premi\u00e8red to improved ratings, the ''All New'' format, hosted by [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] presenter [[Tim Kash]], quickly returned to low ratings and brought about scathing reviews.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/lets-kill-top-of-the-pops-575378.html Let's kill ''Top of the Pops''], ''[[The Independent]]'', 2 December 2003</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3253136.stm Your reviews: ''Top of the Pops''], BBC News, 1{{nbsp}}December 2003</ref> Kash continued to host the show, but Radio{{nbsp}}1 DJs [[Reggie Yates]] and [[Fearne Cotton]] (who had each presented a few shows in 2003, before the revamp) were brought back to co-host alongside him, before Kash was completely dropped by the BBC, later taking up a new contract at MTV. The show continued to be hosted by [[Reggie Yates]] and Fearne Cotton (usually together, but occasionally solo) on Friday evenings until 8{{nbsp}}July 2005.\n\nOn 30 July 2004, the show took place outside a studio environment for the first time by broadcasting outside in [[Gateshead]]. [[Girls Aloud]], [[Busted (band)|Busted]], [[Will Young]] and [[Jamelia]] were among the performers that night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_3931000/3931663.stm |title=CBBC Newsround &#124; First live outside show for TOTP |work=BBC News|date=27 July 2004 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nFigures had plummeted to below three million, prompting an announcement by the [[BBC]] that the show was going to move, again, to Sunday evenings on [[BBC Two]], thus losing the prime-time slot on [[BBC One]] that it had maintained for more than forty years.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4051231.stm ''Top of the Pops'' leaves BBC One], BBC News, 29 November 2004. Retrieved 14 May 2006</ref>\n\nThis move was widely reported as a final \"sidelining\" of the show, and perhaps signalled its likely cancellation. At the time, it was insisted that this was so the show would air immediately after the official announcement of the new top 40 chart on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], as it was thought that by the following Friday, the chart seemed out of date. The final ''Top of the Pops'' to be shown on BBC One (barring Christmas and New Year specials) was broadcast on Monday 11 July 2005, which was edition number 2,166.\n\nThe first edition on BBC Two was broadcast on 17 July 2005 at 7.00&nbsp;pm with presenter Fearne Cotton. After the move to Sundays, Cotton continued to host with a different guest presenter each week, such as [[Rufus Hound]] or [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]]. On a number of occasions, however, [[Reggie Yates]] would step in, joined by female guest presenters such as [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] and [[Anastacia]]. Viewing figures during this period averaged around 1\u00bd million. Shortly after the move to BBC Two, Peters resigned as executive producer.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4216684.stm Andi Peters quits Top of the Pops], BBC News, 5{{nbsp}}September 2005</ref> He was replaced by the BBC's Creative Head of Music Entertainment Mark Cooper, while producer Sally Wood remained to oversee the show on a weekly basis.\n\n===2006: Cancellation===\nOn 20 June 2006, the show was formally cancelled and it was announced that the last edition would be broadcast on 30 July 2006. [[Edith Bowman]] co-presented its hour-long swansong, along with [[Jimmy Savile]] (who was the main presenter on the first show), [[Reggie Yates]], [[Mike Read]], [[Pat Sharp]], [[Sarah Cawood]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Rufus Hound]], [[Tony Blackburn]] and [[Janice Long]].\n\nThe final day of recording was 26 July 2006<ref>[http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LMEI468T ''TOTP: The Final Countdown'' (Rec:2006-07-26 Tx:2006-07-30)], ''BBC Programme Catalogue''</ref> and featured archive footage and tributes, including [[the Rolling Stones]] \u2013 the very first band to appear on ''Top of the Pops'' \u2013 opening with \"The Last Time\", the [[Spice Girls]], [[David Bowie]], [[Wham!]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Gnarls Barkley]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[Sonny and Cher]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. The show closed with a final countdown, topped by [[Shakira]], as her track \"[[Hips Don't Lie]]\" (featuring [[Wyclef Jean]]) had climbed back up to number one on the UK Singles Chart earlier in the day. The show ended with Savile ultimately turning the lights off in the empty studio.\n\nFearne Cotton, who was the current presenter, was unavailable to co-host for the final edition due to her filming of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island]]'' in [[Fiji]] but opened the show with a quick introduction recorded on location, saying \"It's still number one, it's ''Top of the Pops''\".

They were shown performing \"[[Love Machine (Girls Aloud song)|Love Machine]]\".\n\n===2006\u2013present: After the end===\nThe magazine and ''[[Top of the Pops 2|TOTP2]]'' have both survived despite the show's axing, and the Christmas editions also continue after returning to BBC One. However, the ''TOTP'' website, which the BBC had originally promised would continue, is now no longer updated, although many of the old features of the site \u2013 interviews, music news, reviews \u2013 have remained, now in the form of the Radio 1-affiliated TOTP ChartBlog accessible via the remains of the old website.\n\n====Calls for its return====\nIn October 2008, British [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Andy Burnham]] and [[Manchester]] indie band [[the Ting Tings]] called for the show to return.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/the-ting-tings/40496 The Tings Tings: \"Bring back ''Top of the Pops''\"], ''[[NME]]'', 17 October 2008</ref>\n\nOn 29 October 2008, [[Simon Cowell]] stated in an interview that he would be willing to buy the rights to ''Top of the Pops'' from the BBC.

The first programme shown, 1{{nbsp}}April 1976, was chosen because it was from approximately this episode onwards that most editions remain in the BBC archive. The repeat programmes come in two versions; the first is edited down to fit in the 30-minute 7:30 slot, the second is shown normally twice overnight in the following weekend, and is usually complete. However both the short and longer editions can be edited for a number of reasons. Potentially offensive content to modern audiences is cut (for example the Barron Knights' in-studio performance of \"Food For Thought\" on the edition of 13 December 1979 including a segment parodying Chinese takeaways using mannerisms that may now be viewed as offensive), and cinematic film footage can be truncated, replaced or removed entirely due to the costs to the BBC of reshowing such footage.

It was filmed at the ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' aerodrome studio in [[Surrey]] on Sunday, 11 March 2007, although it bore little resemblance to the usual ''Top of the Pops'' format.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, ''Top of The Pops'' was once again revived, this time in its usual format, for a special live [[Comic Relief]] edition, airing on BBC Two while the main telethon took a break for the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' on BBC One. As with the Christmas specials the show was presented by Radio{{nbsp}}1 duo Fearne Cotton and [[Reggie Yates]] with special guest presenter [[Noel Fielding]] and appearances from [[Dawn French]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Claudia Winkleman]], [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Davina McCall]] (dancing in the audience and later as a Flo Rida dancer with Claudia Winkleman and French and Saunders) and [[David Tennant]].\n\nLive performances \u2013 interspersed with Comic Relief appeal films \u2013 included acts such as [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Take That]], [[U2]], [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] and [[Flo Rida]] (that week's Number{{nbsp}}1). Kicking off the show was a performance from [[Rob Brydon]] and [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] in their [[Gavin & Stacey]] guises, feat.

There is uncertainty about what was the shortest performance. In 2005, presenter Reggie Yates announced on the show that it was [[Super Furry Animals]] with \"[[Do or Die (Super Furry Animals song)|Do or Die]]\", broadcast on 28 January 2000, clocking in at 95 seconds. However, \"It's My Turn\" by [[Angelic (band)|Angelic]] was 91 seconds on 16 June 2000 and, according to an August 2012 edition of ''[[TOTP2]]'', \"[[Here Comes the Summer]]\" by [[the Undertones]] was just 84 seconds on 26 July 1979. [[Cliff Richard]] appeared the most times on the show, with almost 160 performances. [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] were the most frequent group with 106 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03j113z|title=BBC Two \u2013 TOTP2, Status Quo|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\n{{Main|Lip-syncing|Miming in instrumental performance}}\nInitially acts performing on the show [[lip-synching in music|mimed]] to the commercially released record, but in 1966 after discussions with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]], miming was banned.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Thompson, Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kzKOaaaCV-EC&pg=PA9&dq=%22top+of+the+pops%22+%22musicians+union%22+1966#v=onepage&q=%22top%20of%20the%20pops%22%20%22musicians%20union%22%201966&f=false|title=Please Please Me: Sixties British Pop, Inside Out|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|page=9|isbn=9780195333183}}</ref> After a few weeks during which some bands' attempts to play as well as on their records were somewhat lacking, a compromise was reached whereby a specially recorded [[backing track]] was permitted, as long as all the musicians on the track were present in the studio.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cripps|first=Charlotte|title=The Musicians' Union: Alive and well, playing by the book|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-musicians-union-alive-and-well-playing-by-the-book-8732216.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=26 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BedZ8B-7V0UC&pg=PT75&dq=%22top+of+the+pops%22+backing+track+musicians#v=onepage&q=%22top%20of%20the%20pops%22%20backing%20track%20musicians&f=false|title=The History of Live Music in Britain, Volume I: 1950\u20131967: From Dance Hall to the 100 Club|author1=Frith, Simon |author2=Brennan, Matt |author3=Cloonan, Martin |author4=Webster, Emma |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781472400291|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A famous example of this is the performance of \"[[All About Eve (album)|Martha's Harbour]]\" in 1988 by [[All About Eve (band)|All About Eve]] where the television audience at home could hear the song but the band and studio audience and personnel could not. As the opening verse of the song beamed out of the nation's television sets, the unknowing lead singer [[Julianne Regan]] remained silent on a stool on stage while [[Tim Bricheno]] (the only other band member present) did not play his guitar. An unseen stagehand apparently prompted them that something was wrong in time to mime along to the second verse. The band were invited back the following week, and chose to sing live.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAlso, [[Jimi Hendrix]] who, on hearing someone else's track being played by mistake (in the days of live broadcast), mumbled \"I don't know the words to that one, man\", [[Shane MacGowan]] of [[the Pogues]]' drunken performance of \"[[Fairytale of New York]]\", a performance of \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in which [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] and [[Liam Gallagher]] exchanged roles with Noel miming to Liam's singing track and Liam pretending to play guitar, and [[John Peel]]'s appearance as the [[mandolin]] soloist for [[Rod Stewart]] on \"[[Maggie May]]\". During their performance of \"Don't leave me this way\" [[Communards (band)|the Communards]] singers [[Jimmy Somerville]] and [[Sarah Jane Morris (singer)|Sarah Jane Morris]] swapped lyrics for part of the song towards the end.\n\nOccasionally bands played live, examples in the 1970s being [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]], [[the Who]], [[John Otway]], [[Sham 69]], [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]], [[Jimmy James and the Vagabonds]], [[Heavy Metal Kids]], [[Elton John]], [[Typically Tropical]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[David Bowie]]. In 1980, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] played live on the show when they refused to mime to their single \"Running Free\". Solo artists and vocal groups were supposed to sing live to the Top of the Pops Orchestra. [[Billy Ocean]], [[Brotherhood of Man]], [[Hylda Baker]] and [[the Nolans]] all performed in this way.\n\nFor a few years from 1991, the show adopted a live vocal to pre-recorded backing track policy. Performing \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] singer [[Kurt Cobain]] dropped his voice an octave and changed the opening line to \"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\"; the band also made it very clear that they were not playing their instruments. (Cobain later said during an interview that he wanted to sound more like [[Morrissey]] during the performance.) It also exposed a number of poor live singers, and was dropped as a general rule.<ref name=\"loud call\">{{cite news|last=Lister|first=David|title=Loud call for miming to return to 'Top of the Pops'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/loud-call-for-miming-to-return-to-top-of-the-pops-1510818.html|accessdate=29 November 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 October 1993|location=London}}</ref> It was not helped by the fact that it coincided with a sudden upsurge of chart success for dance tracks which were heavily sample-based and whose sound could not easily be reproduced in a TV studio \u2013 sampled vocals from other tracks had to be sung live.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn its final few years miming had become less and less common, especially for bands, as studio technology became more reliable and artists were given the freedom to choose their performance style.

The earliest surviving footage dates from 26 February 1964, and consists of performances by [[Billy J. Kramer]] and the Dakotas and [[the Dave Clark Five]]. Some programmes exist only partially (largely performances that were either pre-recorded or re-used in later editions). There are also two examples of rehearsal footage, which are both from 1965, one which includes [[Alan Freeman]] introducing [[the Seekers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMprTCLmin8 |title=The Seekers \u2013 The Carnival Is Over \u2013 Rehearsal 1965 |via=YouTube |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> and another with [[Sandie Shaw]] rehearsing \"[[Long Live Love (Chris Andrews song)|Long Live Love]]\"\u2014both believed to be for the end-of-year Christmas Special. There are also cases of shows that exist only in their raw, unedited form. The oldest complete episode in existence was originally transmitted on [[Boxing Day]] in 1967 (only five complete recordings from the 1960s survive, two of which have mute presenter links). The most recent that is not held is dated 8{{nbsp}}September 1977. Most editions after this date exist in full, except a few 1981\u201385 episodes recorded live feature mute presenter links (These episodes were skipped on the BBC Four re-runs).\n\nSome off-air recordings, made by fans at home with a microphone in front of the TV speaker, exist in varying quality, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] performing a live version of \"Hey Joe\" in December 1966.\n\nSome segments of ''TOTP'' which have been wiped by the BBC do survive in some form owing to having been included in other programmes, either by the BBC itself or by foreign broadcasters. What was thought to be the only surviving footage of the Beatles on the programme, for instance, comes from its re-use in episode one of 1965 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/chase/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The Chase \u2013 Details|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Additionally a number of recordings are believed to exist in private collections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2251425.stm|title=Entertainment &#124; Lost glam rock tapes found|work=BBC News|date=11 September 2002|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> However, in 2019, an 11-second clip of the group's only live appearance on ''TOTP'', from 16 June 1966, was unearthed \u2013 this was recorded by a viewer using an [[8 mm film|8mm camera]] to film the live transmission on their television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47854806 |title=Clip of 'lost' Beatles Top of the Pops performance unearthed |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 April 2019 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 April 2019 }}</ref> Other individual but complete clips that have surfaced over recent years include The Hollies performing Bus Stop, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience playing both Purple Haze and The Wind Cries Mary.\n\nThanks to a deal between the BBC and German television network ZDF around the turn of the 1970s, several TOTP clips were sent over to be shown on Disco, a similar styled chart show. This meant that performances from the likes of The Kinks (Apeman), The Who (The Seeker) and King Crimson (Cat Food) still exist in German archives.\n\nTwo complete episodes from 1967 were discovered in a private collection in 2009, having been recorded at home on an early available open reel to reel video recorder. Whilst the tapes suffered from major damage and degradation of both sound and picture quality, one show featured Pink Floyd with original leader Syd Barrett performing See Emily Play, whilst the second contained Dave Davies singing his solo hit Death of a Clown.\n\nThe programme was forced off the air for several weeks by industrial action by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] in both 1974 and 1980.\n\n==Spin-offs==\n''Top of the Pops'' has a sister show called ''[[Top of the Pops 2|TOTP2]]'' which uses archive footage from as early as the late 1960s. It began on 17 September 1994. The early series were narrated by [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], before [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] took over as narrator. In summer 2004 BBC Two's controller, Roly Keating, announced that it was being \"rested\". Shortly after [[Dave (TV channel)|UKTV G2]] began showing re-edited versions of earlier programmes with re-recorded dialogue. Finally after a two-year break ''TOTP2'' returned to the BBC Two schedules for a new series on Saturday, 30 September 2006, in an evening timeslot. It was still narrated by Steve Wright and featured a mixture of performances from the ''TOTP'' archive and newly recorded performances. The first edition of this series featured new performances by [[Razorlight]] and [[Nelly Furtado]] recorded after the final episode of ''Top of the Pops''. In 2009 [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] took over as narrator.\n\nAired on [[BBC Radio 1]] between the mid-1990s and late 2001 was ''Top of the Pops: The Radio Show'' which went out every Sunday at 3&nbsp;pm just before the singles chart, and was presented by [[Jayne Middlemiss]] and [[Scott Mills]]. It later reappeared on the [[BBC World Service]] in May 2003 originally presented by [[Emma B]], where it continues to be broadcast weekly in an hourly format, now presented by Kim Robson and produced by former BBC World Service producer Alan Rowett.\n\nThe defunct channel [[Play UK]] created two spin offs; ''TOTP+ Plus'' and ''[[TOTP@Play]]'' (2000\u20132001) (until mid-2000, this show was called ''The Phone Zone'' and was a spin-off from BBC Two music series ''[[The O-Zone]]''). [[BBC Choice]] featured a show called ''TOTP The New Chart'' (5 December 1999 \u2013 26 March 2000) and on BBC Two ''TOTP+'' (8 October 2000 \u2013 26 August 2001) which featured the ''TOTP @ Play'' studio and presenters. This is not to be confused with the UK Play version of the same name. A more recent spin-off (now ended) was ''[[Top of the Pops Saturday]]'' hosted originally by [[Fearne Cotton]] and [[Simon Grant]], and its successor ''[[Top of the Pops Reloaded]]''. This was shown on Saturday mornings on BBC One and featured competitions, star interviews, video reviews and some ''Top of the Pops'' performances. This was aimed at a younger audience and was part of the [[CBBC]] Saturday morning line-up. This was to rival ''[[CD:UK]]'' at the same time on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\n==Send-ups==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n\nA number of performers have sent up the format in various ways. Mainly this has been performers who disliked the mime format of the show, often as a more effective protest against this rather than just refusing to appear.\n* When [[Fairport Convention]] appeared to promote their 1969 hit \"[[If You Gotta Go, Go Now|Si Tu Dois Partir]]\", drummer [[Dave Mattacks]] wore a T-shirt printed \"MIMING\".\n* When [[the Smiths]] appeared on the show to perform their single \"[[This Charming Man]]\", lead singer [[Morrissey]] was unhappy about having to lip-sync and so held a bunch of gladioli on the stage instead of a microphone.\n* In 1977, Australian punk band [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] appeared when their minor hit \"This Perfect Day\" made the lower reaches of the chart. Singer Chris Bailey deliberately mimed the lyrics out of time before continuing to sing after allowing the microphone to fall out of his hand. Meanwhile, guitarist Ed Kuepper stood stock still, staring blankly away from the camera whilst strumming intermittently at a fraction of the fast pace of the guitar on the record.\n* During their performance of \"[[Tom Hark]]\" in 1980, the drummer for [[the Piranhas]] used plastic fish instead of drum sticks.\n* Northern Irish punk band [[Stiff Little Fingers]] appeared a few times on the show and each time didn't take it seriously. Normally singer [[Jake Burns]] would pull silly faces and flirt with the camera while playing. Drummer [[Jim Reilly]] would purposely hit the drums in a repetitive manner that didn't match up with the song and at times would pull the drum kit apart before the song was finished. And once, while playing the song \"Just Fade Away\", Reilly played a [[bodhr\u00e1n]] rather than drums.\n* While performing their 1982 hit \"[[Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)]]\", the band [[Dexy's Midnight Runners]] were seen performing in front of a projection of the darts player with a similar sounding name [[Jocky Wilson]] instead of soul singer [[Jackie Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5140720 |title=h2g2 \u2013 Dexy's Midnight Runners \u2013 the Band \u2013 Edited Entry |publisher=BBC |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> Dexy's frontman [[Kevin Rowland]] later said in an interview that the use of the Jocky Wilson picture was his idea and not a mistake by the programme makers as is sometimes stated.<ref>{{cite news|author=Johnny Sharp |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/27/jocky-wilson-other-rock-myths?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Jocky Wilson said \u2013 and other rock myths &#124; Sport |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/09/artsfeatures.bbc |title=Performers share their Top of the Pops memories |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Frankie Goes To Hollywood]] performed one of the many 1984 performances of their hit \"[[Two Tribes]]\" with bassist [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]] playing drums whilst drummer [[Ped Gill]] played bass.\n* In the midst of a 1986 performance of their hit \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\", [[The Communards]]\" vocalists [[Jimmy Somerville]] and [[Sarah Jane Morris (singer)|Sarah Jane Morris]] began to sing each other's vocals, an especially ironic change given that Somerville's part was much higher than that of Morris.\n* After [[the Bluebells]]' hit \"[[Young at Heart (Bananarama song)|Young at Heart]]\" unexpectedly reached number one in 1993, nine years after the song's original release, the band reunited after having spent many years disbanded to play the song several times on the show where they parodied various other famous acts of the time such as [[Shabba Ranks]] and [[2 Unlimited]], one performance including lead singer Ken McCluskey pretending to play or scratch records on a \"Bluebells Disco\" DJ deck erected in front of the stage. The performance from 25 March is also remembered for an unusual camera technique where a camera was fixed to the bow of the violinist, Bobby Valentino, leading to several fast and humorous shots of the bow being used.\n* When [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] mimed to \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\" on ''Top of the Pops'' in 1994, one of the cello players from the symphony was replaced by rhythm guitarist [[Paul Arthurs|Bonehead]], who clearly had no idea how the instrument should be played. Towards the end of the song, he gave up the pretence and started using the bow to conduct. A woman plays his rhythm guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Q82WlLQS4 |title=YouTube |via=YouTube |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> On another occasion Liam walked away from the microphone and chewed gum during a 2005 performance of \"[[Lyla (song)|Lyla]]\".\n* [[Faith No More]] lead singer [[Mike Patton]] also showed he was obviously miming a performance by sticking his tongue out of the side of his mouth during close-up shots. Also, their 1997 performance of \"Ashes to Ashes\" on the show featured Robin Guy (of the band Sack Trick) on drums instead of their actual drummer. He apparently wore a \"Puffy\" mask as a joke in reference to Faith No More's actual drummer, Mike \"Puffy\" Bordin. Mike Patton can be seen giving Guy the finger during the performance, supposedly because the mask fell off (or was taken off on purpose) as soon as the performance started.\n* Singer [[Les Gray]] of [[Mud (band)|Mud]] went on stage to perform with a ventriloquist dummy during the performance of \"[[Lonely This Christmas]]\" and had the dummy lip-synch to the voice-over in the middle of the song.\n* During [[Mott the Hoople]]'s performance of their single \"[[Roll Away the Stone]]\" in 1973, drummer [[Dale Griffin]] plays with oversized drumsticks.\n* For [[Orbital (band)|Orbital's]] debut ''TOTP'' performance they just stood around, occasionally leaning forward to press a button on their sequencers. One of their machines had its power plug deliberately draped across it, to show the equipment wasn't even plugged in.\n* [[EMF (band)|EMF]] appeared on the show with one of the guitarists strumming along while wearing boxing gloves.\n* In [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s performance of \"[[Charmless Man]]\" in 1996, [[Dave Rowntree]] decided to play with oversized drumsticks, while [[Graham Coxon]] played a mini guitar.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSJ_9zqPwE YouTube \u2013 Broadcast Yourself] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730102317/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSJ_9zqPwE |date=30 July 2013 }}</ref>\n* In [[Green Day]]'s first ''Top of the Pops'' appearance in 1994, the band played the song \"[[Welcome to Paradise]]\". Frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] wore an otherwise plain white T-shirt with the phrase \"Who am I fooling anyway?\" handwritten on it, most likely a reference to his own miming during the performance. He could also be seen not playing his guitar during the instrumental bridge in the song.\n* The performance of \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]] and the [[Faces (band)|Faces]] featured [[John Peel]] miming on mandolin. Near the end of the song, Rod and the Faces begin to kick around a football. This is despite the fact that the music can be still heard playing in the background.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBUjdRKJifI YouTube \u2013 Broadcast Yourself] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043553/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBUjdRKJifI |date=26 June 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Eels (band)|Eels]] performed \"[[Novocaine for the Soul]]\" playing on toy instruments, which they then trashed.\n* [[The Cure]] were known for their abhorrence for miming their songs whilst on ''TOTP'' and on several occasions made it obvious they were not playing their parts \u2013 using such stunts as playing guitar left-handed, miming very badly out of synch and dressing their instruments up in clothes.\n* During \"[[Sing (Travis song)|Sing]]\" by [[Travis (band)|Travis]], a pie fight broke out which aped the music video of the song. Even though the members of the band got involved, the music still played in the background.\n* [[Ambient house]] group [[the Orb]] notably sat and played chess while an edited version of their 39:57-minute single \"[[Blue Room (The Orb song)|Blue Room]]\" played in the background.\n* [[Depeche Mode]]'s performance of \"[[Barrel of a Gun (Depeche Mode song)|Barrel of a Gun]]\" in 1997 featured famous Dutch photographer and director [[Anton Corbijn]] who mimed playing the drums. Also Tim Simenon (who produced the album the song appeared on) mimed playing keyboards along with Andy Fletcher.\n* When [[the Cuban Boys]] performed \"[[Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia]]\" at the end of 1999, a performance which was reportedly unbroadcast, the band wearing labcoats, covered in cobwebs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecubanboys.co.uk/cuban_cvi.htm |title=Cognoscenti Vs Intelligentsia |publisher=Cuban Boys |date=7 April 1999 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> The performance came during the song's peak in popularity, which grew extreme reactions, both positive and negative.\n* In [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s only appearance on the show, [[Kurt Cobain]] deliberately sang their 1991 hit \"[[Smells like Teen Spirit]]\" in a low monotonous voice (he later claimed to be impersonating Morrissey) and the guitarists waved their guitars around above their heads during the famous guitar intro of the song.\n* When the [[Boomtown Rats]] performed \"[[Rat Trap]]\" on the show, [[Bob Geldof]] mimed playing a candelabra with a saxophone mouthpiece over the opening saxophone part, rather than pretend to play an actual instrument, and seems to be deliberately over-exaggerating his movements. During the same performance the band ripped up pictures of [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] at the beginning of the song to celebrate having replaced \"[[Summer Nights (Grease song)|Summer Nights]]\" (from the soundtrack of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'') at number one.\n\n==International versions==\n===Europe===\nThe ''TOTP'' format was sold to [[RTL Television|RTL]] in Germany in the 1990s, and aired on Saturday afternoons. It was very successful for a long time, with a compilation album series and magazine. However, in 2006 it was announced that the German show would be ending. The Italian version (first broadcast on [[Rai 2]] and later on [[Italia 1]]) also ended in 2006. In February 2010 the show returned on Rai 2, and was broadcast for two seasons before being cancelled again in October 2011. The French version of the show ended by September 2006 on France 2. The Dutch version of the show continued to run on [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] until the end of December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnn.nl/page/pers/45090/TOP%20OF%20THE%20POPS%20NEDERLAND%20STOPT|title=TOP OF THE POPS NEDERLAND STOPT |accessdate=3 December 2006 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004745/http://www.bnn.nl/page/pers/45090/TOP%20OF%20THE%20POPS%20NEDERLAND%20STOPT |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> [[BBC Prime]] used to broadcast re-edited episodes of the BBC version, the weekend after it was transmitted in the UK. Ireland began transmitting ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1978 on [[RT\u00c92]]. This was the UK version being transmitted at the same time as on BBC. The broadcasts ceased in late 1993.\n\n===United States and Canada===\n''Top of the Pops'' had short-lived fame in the United States. In October 1987, the [[CBS]] television network decided to try an American version of the show. It was hosted by [[Nia Peeples]] and even showed performances from the BBC version of the programme. The show was presented on late Friday nights as part of ''[[The CBS Late Movie|CBS Late Night]]'', and lasted almost half a year.\n\nIn 2002, [[BBC America]] presented the BBC version of ''Top of the Pops'' as part of their weekend schedule. The network would get the episodes one week after they were transmitted in the UK. BBC America then tinkered with the show by cutting a few minutes out of each show and moving it to a weekday time slot.\n\nOn 23 January 2006, [[Lou Pearlman]] made a deal to bring ''Top of the Pops'' back to the airwaves in the United States. It was expected to be similar to the 1987 version, but it would also utilise the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]] music charts, most notably the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. It was supposed to be planned for a possible 2006 or 2007 launch, but with several lawsuits against Lou and his companies (which resulted in his conviction in 2008), as well as the cancellation of the UK version, the proposed US project never went forward. On 19 August 2006, [[VH1]] aired the UK series' final episode.\n\nThe United States had its own similar series, ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which aired nationally on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1957 to 1987 (although it would continue in first-run syndication until 1988 and end its run on [[USA Network|USA]] in 1989). Similar series also included ''[[Soul Train]]'' (1970\u20132006, featuring [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] artists), ''[[Club MTV]]'' (1986\u201392, featuring [[Dance Music]] acts; hosted by [[Downtown Julie Brown]], an alumnus of TOTP as part of the show's last dance troupe [[Zoo (dance troupe)|Zoo]]) and ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' (1980\u201388; like the early TOTP, it also used dance troupes).\n\nCanada's version of this (mostly of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[Soul Train]]'') was ''[[Electric Circus]]'' (1988\u20132003) on [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], which was also seen in the USA through [[Fuse (TV channel)#As MuchMusic USA|MuchMusic USA]]. It had a national chart (mostly of dance music and some pop) as well as live performances, and was based on a local late '70s programme in [[Toronto]] called ''[[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] Boogie''.\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe ''Top of the Pops'' brand has also been exported to [[New Zealand]] which for many years had to rely on music-video only shows to demonstrate its Top 20 (as well as the occasional season of the UK version of ''TOTP'') as the world's top acts considered New Zealand too far away from the major markets to visit regularly. This changed in 2002 when the New Zealand government suggested a voluntary New Zealand music quota on radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=1291784 |title=New Zealand music quota for radio \u2013 National \u2013 NZ Herald News |website=The New Zealand Herald |date=26 March 2002 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref> (basically a threat that if the stations did not impose a quota themselves then one would be imposed on them). This worked and suddenly the amount of indigenous music played on radio stations increased, as did the number of New Zealand hits in the top 20. Therefore, a new version of a show like ''Top of the Pops'' became feasible for the first time, and the show was commissioned by [[Television New Zealand]]. The show was Executive Produced by David Rose, managing director and owner of Satellite Media and began in early 2004 with host Alex Behan. The hour-long show (as opposed to the 30-minute UK version) which is broadcast at 5&nbsp;pm on Saturdays on [[TV2 (New Zealand)]] contains a mixture of songs recorded on a sound stage in the Auckland CBD, as well as performances from the international versions of the show. The New Zealand Top 20 singles and Top 10 albums are also featured. Alex stayed as host for two years before Bede Skinner took over. Despite a popular fan base in early 2006 TVNZ announced that ''Top of the Pops'' has been axed and ideas for new music shows are currently being considered.\n\nFree-to-air music channel [[C4 (TV channel)|C4]] then picked up the UK version of ''Top of the Pops'' and aired it on Saturdays at 8&nbsp;pm with a repeat screening on Thursdays. However, since the weekly UK version was axed itself, this arrangement also ended.\n\n===Africa, Asia and the Middle East===\nAn edited version of the UK show was shown on [[BBC Prime]], the weekend after UK transmission.\n\nIn addition, a licensed version was shown on the [[United Arab Emirates]]-based [[MBC 2 (Middle East)|MBC{{nbsp}}2]] television channel. This version consisted of parts of the UK version, including the Top 10 charts, as well as live performances by [[Arabic pop music|Arabic pop]] singers.\n\n===Latin America===\nA complete version of the UK show was shown on [[Liv (Latin American TV channel)|People+Arts]], two weeks after the UK transmission.\n\nBrazilian network [[TV Globo]] aired a loosely based version of the original format in 2018, labeled as 'S\u00f3 Toca Top', hosted by singer [[Luan Santana]] and actress [[Fernanda Souza]].\n\n==Compilation albums==\nA number of compilation albums using the ''Top of the Pops'' brand have been issued over the years. The first one to reach the charts was ''BBC TV's The Best of Top of the Pops'' on the Super Beeb record label in 1975, which reached number 21 and in 1986 the BBC released ''The Wizard'' by Paul Hardcastle (the 1986-1990 Top of The Pops theme tune) on Vinyl under the BBC Records and Tapes banner.\n\nStarting in 1968 and carrying on through the 1970s a rival series of ''[[Top of the Pops (record series)|Top of the Pops]]'' albums were produced, however these had no connection with the television series except for its name. They were a series of budget [[cover version|cover]] albums of current chart hits recorded by anonymous session singers and musicians released on the Hallmark record label. They had initially reached the charts but were later disallowed due to a change in the criteria for entering the charts. These albums continued to be produced until the early 1980s, when the advent of compilation albums featuring the original versions of hits, such as the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series, led to a steep decline in their popularity.\n\nIn the 1990s, the BBC ''Top of the Pops'' brand was again licensed for use in a tie-in compilation series. Starting in 1995 with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music's]] [[Columbia Records]] label, these double disc collections moved to the special marketing arm of [[PolyGram]] / [[Universal Music Group]] TV, before becoming a sister brand of the ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' range in the [[EMI]] / [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] / Universal joint venture.\n\nSimilarly to the roles of ''Top of the Pops'' on BBC One and BBC Two in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the compilation albums range featured current hits for the main series and classic hits (such as '70s Rock) for the \"Top of the Pops 2\" spin-offs.\n\nThe ''Top of the Pops'' brand has now been licensed by EMI who released a compilation series in 2007\u201308, with one CD for each year that ''Top of the Pops'' was running. The boxset for the entire series of 43 discs was released 7{{nbsp}}July 2008. A podcast supporting the release of the boxset featuring interviews with [[Mark Goodier]], [[Miles Leonard]], [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[David Hepworth]] is available.\n\n===Number One in the Compilation Charts===\nThese albums in the series reached No. 1:\n* '''Top of the Pops 1''' ([[Columbia Records]], 1995)\n* '''Top of the Pops '99 \u2013 Volume 2''' ([[Universal Music TV]], 1999)\n* '''Top of the Pops 2000 \u2013 Volume Two''' ([[BBC Music]] / [[Universal Music TV]], 2000)\n\n==''Top of the Pops'' magazine==\n[[Top of the Pops (magazine)|''Top of the Pops'' magazine]] has been running since February 1995, and filled the void in the BBC magazine portfolio where [[Number One (magazine)|''Number One'' magazine]] used to be. It began much in the mould of [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]], then changed its editorial policy to directly compete with popular teen celebrity magazines such as ''[[Smash Hits]]'' and ''Big'', with free sticker giveaways replacing [[Brett Anderson]] covers.\n\nA July 1996 feature on the [[Spice Girls]] coined the famous \"Spice\" nicknames for each member ([[Emma Bunton|Baby]], [[Geri Halliwell|Ginger]], [[Victoria Beckham|Posh]], [[Melanie Brown|Scary]] and [[Melanie Chisholm|Sporty]]) that stayed with them throughout their career as a group and beyond.<ref name=\"Spice Girls\">{{cite news|title=How Did The Spice Girls Get Their Nicknames?

Mud drummer Dave Mount sat reading an edition throughout a 1975 appearance on the show.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The Scottish punk band [[the Rezillos]] lampooned the show as a vehicle for vapid commercialism and for paying little or no attention to talented, unknown bands, in their song \"Top of the Pops.\" The band performed the song on the programme twice when it entered the charts.\n* [[The KLF|The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (who later became [[the KLF]]) sampled nearly three minutes of ''Top of the Pops'' on their album ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]''.\n* In the opening credits of the [[Spice Girls]]' 1997 feature film ''[[Spice World (film)|Spiceworld: The Movie]]'', the girls perform their hit single \"[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]\" on a fictional episode of the show. They did also perform it on the show in real life when it became their second Christmas number one in the UK that same year.\n* A 2001 episode of ''[[Tweenies]]'' featured a parody of ''Top of the Pops'', complete with Max imitating Jimmy Savile. The episode was unintententionally repeated in January 2013, and received 216 complaints.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/20/bbc-jimmy-savile-parody-cbeebies |title=BBC apologises over Jimmy Savile parody on CBeebies |work=The Guardian |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n* The No. 6 track of [[the Kinks]]' eighth studio album ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' is called \"Top of the Pops\" and narrates the path to stardom by reaching No.{{nbsp}}1 in the music charts.\n* ''[[The Goodies]]'' episode \"[[Superstar (The Goodies)|Superstar]]\" contained a spoof edition of Top of the Pops. Entrance to the show was protected by barbed wire and machine guns with a poster declaring \"Tonight Girls Only. Must be over 16 and under 17. With Big Knockers\". It also featured an impersonation of Jimmy Savile by [[John Peel]].\n* ''[[Benny Hill]]'' did a parody of ''Top of the Pops'' in January 1971 called \"Top of the Tops\". It featured satires of many music acts at the time as well as impersonating both Jimmy Savile and [[Tony Blackburn]].\n* The Comedy Sketch Series ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' did a parody of ''Top of the Pops'' in 1982 called \"Crop of the Flops\". It featured satires of many music acts at the time as well as [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]] both impersonating Jimmy Savile.\n* First Episode of the Vicar of Dibley, \"[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series 1 (1994)|The Arrival]]\" written by Richard Curtis first aired 10 November 1994 A party to introduce The Reverend Geraldine Granger ([[Dawn French]]) during her welcome speech she states in shocked disappointed surprise \"We're missing top of the pops!\" everyone in attendance gives a look of sadness for a moment.\n* [[French and Saunders|French & Saunders]] [[List of French and Saunders episodes#Series 6 (2004)|Season{{nbsp}}6 Episode{{nbsp}}5]] Saunders has to write a new series and Dawn French has been invited to go on Fit Farm but doesn't know why.

Before the matter was resolved the BBC requested the assistance of their own staff members to fill-in as audience members for this and other music shows.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4762783.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; BBC staff asked to form audiences |work=BBC News|date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==DVDs==\nIn 2004 there was a DVD released called ''[[Top of the Pops 40th Anniversary 1964\u20132004 DVD]]''. It features live performances, containing one song for each year, except 1966. (Two tracks from 1965 are featured instead). Also included as extras are seven opening titles, most notably the one with the flying coloured [[LP record|LP]]'s from 1981. This title sequence had [[Phil Lynott]]'s song \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\" as the theme. The 1986 and 1989 titles are also featured, with [[Paul Hardcastle]]'s hit \"The Wizard\" as the theme. This DVD was to celebrate 40 years since the show started.\n\nThere was also a DVD quiz released in 2007 called ''The Essential Music Quiz''.

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling.
