The tunnels and trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share all their stations and most of the track with other lines. The [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]], [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[Victoria line|Victoria]] and [[Waterloo & City line]]s are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels with a diameter of about {{convert|11|ft|8|in}}, lined with cast-iron or precast concrete rings, which were bored using a [[tunnelling shield]]. These were called the ''tube'' lines, although since the 1950s the term \"tube\" has come to be used to refer to the whole London Underground system.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|loc=Preface}} Many of the central London deep-tube line stations, such as those on the Central and Piccadilly lines, are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 33, 38, 81}} The deep-tube lines generally have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and North Ealing and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with [[London Overground]] services north of Queen's Park.<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web |url= http://cartometro.com/cartes/metro-london/ |title=Detailed London Transport Map |accessdate=1 December 2012|work=cartometro.com}}</ref>\n\nThere are {{convert|20|mi}} of cut-and-cover tunnel and {{convert|93|mi}} of tube tunnel, the other 55 per cent of the system running above ground.<ref name=\"Key Facts\"/> Trains generally run on the left-hand track, although in some places, for example the Central line east of St Paul's station, tunnels are above each other.<ref name=\"map\"/> The Victoria line has right-hand running between Warren Street and King's Cross St. Pancras, allowing [[cross-platform interchange]] with the Northern line (Bank branch) between northbound and southbound trains at Euston.<ref name=\"map\"/>{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=327\u2013328}} \n[[File:London Underground with Greater London map.svg|thumb|center|900px|A geographical map of the London Underground, showing the proportional spread of the network over the city (except for Amersham and Chesham stations, which are out of the field of view in the top left]]\n\nSix of the 32 [[London boroughs]] are not served by the Underground. All of these are south of the [[River Thames]]: [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]]. The borough of Lewisham used to be served by the Underground on the [[East London Line|East London line]] \u2013 now part of [[London Overground]] \u2013 at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]]. Of the boroughs through which the Underground lines pass, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] is served solely by [[Manor House tube station|Manor House station]] on the Piccadilly line in the very north-western edge of the borough. For the most part however, some of the tube lines like the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] skirt around the perimeter of Hackney rather than going straight through it.

On the sections of line shared with main line trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails, as the electrical return from National Rail trains is via the wheels.<ref name=\"Martin2012\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Martin|title=Underground, Overground: A Passenger's History of the Tube|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh3n5WD_YqsC&pg=PT137|accessdate=7 December 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1-84765-807-4|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> This was first used in the early 20th century, the isolated traction current return allowing a train's position to be detected using DC [[track circuit]]s, and reduced any earth leakage currents that could affect service pipes and telephone cables.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=89}}\n\nThe traction current has no direct earth point, but there are two resistors connected across the traction supply. The junction point of the resistors is earthed, establishing the reference point between the positive and negative rails by [[voltage division]]. The resistors are large enough to prevent large currents flowing through the earthed infrastructure. The positive resistor is twice as large as the negative resistor, since the positive rail carries twice the voltage of the negative rail.\n\n===Ventilation and cooling===\n{{main|London Underground cooling}}\nThe Metropolitan Railway's first line was built in the belief that it would be operated by smokeless locomotives and with little thought given to ventilation.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=117}} Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers,{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=31}} the ventilation being later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between King's Cross and Gower Street and removing glazing in the station roofs,{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|pp=117\u2013118}} and the later extensions and the District Railway were built with stations in the open.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=16}} With the problem on the original line continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=119}} This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report that reported a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the underground sections of the Metropolitan and District railways were electrified before these were built.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=119}}\n\nForced ventilation was not considered when the deep-tube Central London Railway opened in 1900, engineers considering that the movement of the electric trains would give sufficient air circulation. However, soon after opening there were complaints about a smell that the company couldn't explain, and by 1911 they had installed a system of fans injecting filtered air and ozone.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=35, 40}} Exhaust fans had been fitted at most stations when the [[Underground Electric Railways Company]] (UERL) opened its three tube lines in 1906\u20137,{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=89}} a maximum temperature of {{convert|60|F|disp=flip}} in hot weather being advertised on the Bakerloo line.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=70}} However, over time heat from the trains has warmed up the tube tunnels, and in 1938 approval was given to a \u00a3500,000 programme to improve the ventilation and an [[Tottenham Court Road chiller|experimental refrigeration plant was installed]] in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253\u2013254}} More recently, temperatures of {{convert|47|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm |title=Baking hot at Baker Street |work=BBC News |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2013 |last= Griffiths |first= Emma}}</ref> It was pointed out in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1405628/Londons-Tube-unfit-for-animals.html |title=London's Tube 'unfit for animals' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> A 2003 study reported that air quality seventy-three times worse than at street level, with twenty minutes on the Northern line having \"the same effect as smoking a cigarette\".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/passengers-choke-on-the-tube-6304049.html |title= Passengers choke on the Tube |work=London Evening Standard |author=Murray, Dick |date=23 August 2002|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253\u2013254}} and the recent system on the Jubilee line extension was designed to allow cooling of the tubes at night.

These were called the ''tube'' lines, although since the 1950s the term \"tube\" has come to be used to refer to the whole London Underground system.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|loc=Preface}} Many of the central London deep-tube line stations, such as those on the Central and Piccadilly lines, are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 33, 38, 81}} The deep-tube lines generally have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and North Ealing and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with [[London Overground]] services north of Queen's Park.<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web |url= http://cartometro.com/cartes/metro-london/ |title=Detailed London Transport Map |accessdate=1 December 2012|work=cartometro.com}}</ref>\n\nThere are {{convert|20|mi}} of cut-and-cover tunnel and {{convert|93|mi}} of tube tunnel, the other 55 per cent of the system running above ground.<ref name=\"Key Facts\"/> Trains generally run on the left-hand track, although in some places, for example the Central line east of St Paul's station, tunnels are above each other.<ref name=\"map\"/> The Victoria line has right-hand running between Warren Street and King's Cross St. Pancras, allowing [[cross-platform interchange]] with the Northern line (Bank branch) between northbound and southbound trains at Euston.<ref name=\"map\"/>{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=327\u2013328}} \n[[File:London Underground with Greater London map.svg|thumb|center|900px|A geographical map of the London Underground, showing the proportional spread of the network over the city (except for Amersham and Chesham stations, which are out of the field of view in the top left]]\n\nSix of the 32 [[London boroughs]] are not served by the Underground. All of these are south of the [[River Thames]]: [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]]. The borough of Lewisham used to be served by the Underground on the [[East London Line|East London line]] \u2013 now part of [[London Overground]] \u2013 at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]]. Of the boroughs through which the Underground lines pass, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] is served solely by [[Manor House tube station|Manor House station]] on the Piccadilly line in the very north-western edge of the borough. For the most part however, some of the tube lines like the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] skirt around the perimeter of Hackney rather than going straight through it. The [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]] had no Underground station until [[North Greenwich tube station|North Greenwich station]] opened on the [[Jubilee line]] extension in 1999.\n\n===Electrification===\n[[File:Amersham A Stock (1).jpg|thumb|left|The older Metropolitan line train A Stock bound for Amersham]]\nThe lines are electrified with a [[Railway electrification system#Fourth rail|four-rail]] [[Direct current|DC]] system: a conductor rail between the rails is energised at&nbsp;\u2212210&nbsp;V and a rail outside the running rails at +420&nbsp;V, giving a potential difference of 630&nbsp;V. On the sections of line shared with main line trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails, as the electrical return from National Rail trains is via the wheels.<ref name=\"Martin2012\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Martin|title=Underground, Overground: A Passenger's History of the Tube|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh3n5WD_YqsC&pg=PT137|accessdate=7 December 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1-84765-807-4|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> This was first used in the early 20th century, the isolated traction current return allowing a train's position to be detected using DC [[track circuit]]s, and reduced any earth leakage currents that could affect service pipes and telephone cables.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=89}}\n\nThe traction current has no direct earth point, but there are two resistors connected across the traction supply. The junction point of the resistors is earthed, establishing the reference point between the positive and negative rails by [[voltage division]]. The resistors are large enough to prevent large currents flowing through the earthed infrastructure. The positive resistor is twice as large as the negative resistor, since the positive rail carries twice the voltage of the negative rail.\n\n===Ventilation and cooling===\n{{main|London Underground cooling}}\nThe Metropolitan Railway's first line was built in the belief that it would be operated by smokeless locomotives and with little thought given to ventilation.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=117}} Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers,{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=31}} the ventilation being later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between King's Cross and Gower Street and removing glazing in the station roofs,{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|pp=117\u2013118}} and the later extensions and the District Railway were built with stations in the open.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=16}} With the problem on the original line continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=119}} This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report that reported a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the underground sections of the Metropolitan and District railways were electrified before these were built.{{sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=119}}\n\nForced ventilation was not considered when the deep-tube Central London Railway opened in 1900, engineers considering that the movement of the electric trains would give sufficient air circulation. However, soon after opening there were complaints about a smell that the company couldn't explain, and by 1911 they had installed a system of fans injecting filtered air and ozone.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=35, 40}} Exhaust fans had been fitted at most stations when the [[Underground Electric Railways Company]] (UERL) opened its three tube lines in 1906\u20137,{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=89}} a maximum temperature of {{convert|60|F|disp=flip}} in hot weather being advertised on the Bakerloo line.{{sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=70}} However, over time heat from the trains has warmed up the tube tunnels, and in 1938 approval was given to a \u00a3500,000 programme to improve the ventilation and an [[Tottenham Court Road chiller|experimental refrigeration plant was installed]] in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road.{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253\u2013254}} More recently, temperatures of {{convert|47|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm |title=Baking hot at Baker Street |work=BBC News |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2013 |last= Griffiths |first= Emma}}</ref> It was pointed out in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1405628/Londons-Tube-unfit-for-animals.html |title=London's Tube 'unfit for animals' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> A 2003 study reported that air quality seventy-three times worse than at street level, with twenty minutes on the Northern line having \"the same effect as smoking a cigarette\".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/passengers-choke-on-the-tube-6304049.html |title= Passengers choke on the Tube |work=London Evening Standard |author=Murray, Dick |date=23 August 2002|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels{{sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253\u2013254}} and the recent system on the Jubilee line extension was designed to allow cooling of the tubes at night.
