It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled. These exactions were harshly enforced, causing extreme hardship in many areas.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=114}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Troupes carthaginoises Arverniales 2012.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=A group of men dressed in clothes and carrying weapons from the 3rd century BC accompanying a medium-sized elephant|{{center|Modern recreations of Carthaginian soldiers and a [[war elephant]] at the 2012 [[Gergovie plateau#Events#Les Arverniales|Arverniales]] [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]}}]]\n\nCarthaginian armies were nearly always composed of foreigners; citizens only served in the army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}} [[Libyans]] provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spears{{snd}}both were noted for their discipline and staying power.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifiction|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifiction|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again. The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe historian Dexter Hoyos writes that the  \"the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage's domestic fortunes and military orientation\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} Miles agrees there was \"a period of profound political transformation\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=214}} The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=211}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=213}} The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the [[Barcid]] family. Immediately after the war Hamilcar led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in southern [[Carthaginian Iberia|Iberia]]; this was to become a semi-autonomous Barcid fiefdom.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=216, 225}}{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar's son, Hannibal, was to lead Carthage to war in the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=152\u2013155}}|group=note}}  In 218 BC a Carthaginian army under [[Hannibal Barca]] besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia and ignited the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Craige B. \n|last=Champion\n|chapter=Polybius and the Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages=95\u2013110\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite web\n|url=\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/9781119099000.wbabat0270\n|title=The First Punic War and After, 264\u2013237 BC\n|last= Eckstein\n|first=Arthur\n|date=2017\n|website=The Encyclopedia of Ancient Battles\n|publisher=Wiley Online Library\n|access-date=12 March 2020\n|doi=\n|ref=harv }}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

There were 33 boxers entered, but the boxer from the [[Republic of China (Formosa) at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Republic of China]] withdrew at the last minute, too late to change the bracket; therefore, one bout was conducted in the round of 64 and one boxer received a bye in the round of 32.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Oliver Taylor, Brunon Bendig, Oleg Grigoryev, Primo Zamparini 1960.jpg
