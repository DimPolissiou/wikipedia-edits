({{lang-ja|\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\uff01}}) is a 1970 [[epic film|epic]] [[war film]] that dramatizes the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941. The film was produced by [[Elmo Williams]] and directed by [[Richard Fleischer]]<!--The Japanese segments form a significant portion of the film:-->, [[Toshio Masuda (director)|Toshio Masuda]] and [[Kinji Fukasaku]], and stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Martin Balsam]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[S\u014d Yamamura]], [[E. G. Marshall]], [[James Whitmore]], [[Tatsuya Mihashi]], [[Takahiro Tamura]], [[Wesley Addy]], and [[Jason Robards]]. It was Masuda and Fukasaku's first English-language film, and first non-Japanese film.\n\nThe ''tora'' of the title is the two-syllable [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Code name|codeword]] used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved. Japanese being a language with many [[homophone]]s, it is a coincidence that ''tora'' also means \"tiger\" ({{lang|ja|\u864e}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iknow.jp/courses/618828|title=Japanese Phonology: Homophones from Core Lists (complete) \u2013 iKnow!|last=http://corp.dmm.com/|first=\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793eDMM.com -|website=iknow.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1939, the United States imposes a trade embargo on a belligerent Japan, severely limiting raw materials. Influential [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] figures and politicians push through an  [[Tripartite Pact| alliance with Germany and Italy]] in September 1940 and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]], [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]], reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at [[Pearl Harbor]], believing that Japan's best hope of controlling the [[Pacific Ocean]] is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer [[Minoru Genda]] is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] is selected to lead the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese ''[[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple Code]]'', allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel and General Short do their best to increase defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii.\n\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]] is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]]'s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. The Japanese thus achieve surprise and a joyous commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 a declaration of war \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura|Japanese ambassador]], helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by a despondent Hull.\n\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and ominously concludes: \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\"\n\n==Cast==\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Martin Balsam]]\n|[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Husband E.

Zanuck]], who had earlier produced ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\", with a \"revisionist's approach\". He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, [[Walter Short|General Short]] and [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Kimmel]], though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese. Despite a breakthrough in intelligence, they had received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack.<ref name=\"Parish p. 411\" /> Recognizing that a balanced and objective recounting was necessary, Zanuck developed an American-Japanese co-production, allowing for \"a point of view from both nations\".<ref name=\"Orriss pp. 194\u2013195\" /> He was helped out by his son, [[Richard D.

I felt he was not only uncomfortable directing this kind of movie but also he wasn't used to having somebody tell him how he should make his film. He always had complete autonomy, and nobody would dare make a suggestion to Kurosawa about the budget, or shooting schedule, or anything like that. And then here he was, with Darryl Zanuck on his back and Richard Zanuck on him and Elmo Williams and the production managers, and it was all stuff that he never had run into before, because he was always untouchable. I think he was getting more and more nervous and more insecure about how he was going to work on this film. And of course, the press got a hold of a lot of this unrest on the set and they made a lot out of that in Japan, and it was more pressure on him, and he wasn't used to that kind of pressure.<ref>Galbraith, Stewart. \"[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] interview of Richard Fleischer.\" ''Tora!

These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship's decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: ''Akagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}. This was done because it was known that for the launching scenes filmed in the US, a US carrier would be used and the islands of US carriers were always on the starboard side. A few of the modified aircraft were also converted in Japan for the flight scenes filmed there.\n\nIn preparation for filming, ''Yorktown'' was berthed at [[NAS North Island]] in San Diego to load all the aircraft, maintenance, and film crew prior to sailing to Hawaii. The night before filming the \"Japanese\" take-off scenes she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these \"Japanese\" aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have [[arresting gear]] with which to land back on the carrier, and continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. ''Yorktown'' sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii and the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor.

The aircraft stayed aloft to use up as much fuel as possible, which gave the film crew some time to prepare, prior to landing. After viewing the \"single gear\" landing footage they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft used are the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and, especially, the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] (two flyable examples were used). Predominantly, P-40 fighter aircraft are used to depict the U.S. defenders with a full-scale P-40 used as a template for fiberglass replicas (some with working engines and props) that were strafed and blown up during filming.<ref>[[#refHathaway1969|Hathaway 1969]], p. 52.</ref> Fleischer also said a scene involving a P-40 model crashing into the middle of a line of P-40s was unintended, as it was supposed to crash at the end of the line.

Retrieved: February 12, 2012.</ref> The ship was leased by the film producers, who needed an aircraft carrier for the film; and as ''Yorktown'' was scheduled to be decommissioned in 1970, the Navy made her available.  She was used largely in the takeoff sequence of the Japanese attack aircraft. The sequence shows interchanging shots of models of the Japanese aircraft carriers and ''Yorktown''. It does not look like any of the Japanese carriers involved in the attack, due to its large [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] island and its angled landing deck. The Japanese carriers had small bridge islands, and angled flight decks were not developed until after the war.<ref>Hone, Thomas C., Norman Friedman and Mark D. Mandeles.

Admiral Halsey was on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, not the ''Essex''-class carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, which would not be commissioned until 1944. This is understandable, however, as both ''Enterprise'' and all six of the Japanese carriers from the attack had been scrapped and sunk, respectively. ''Enterprise'' was scrapped in 1959, and four of the six, including ''Akagi'', were sunk within six months of the attack at the [[Battle of Midway]].\n\nIn ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', an error involves the model of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi}}. In the film, ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge island is positioned on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the ship, which is typical on most aircraft carriers. However, the aircraft carrier ''Akagi'' was an exception; its bridge island was on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side of the ship. Despite this, the bridge section appeared accurately as a mirrored version of ''Akagi''{{'}}s real port-side bridge.<ref name=\"Orriss p. 196\">[[#refOrriss1984|Orriss 1984]], p. 196.</ref> Secondly, all the Japanese aircraft in the footage bear the markings of ''Akagi''{{'}}s aircraft (a single vertical red stripe following the red sun symbol of Japan), even though five other aircraft carriers participated, each having its own markings. In addition, the markings do not display the aircraft's identification numbers as was the case in the actual battle. The white surround on the [[roundel]] on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards. Prior to this the roundel was red only.<ref name=\"Robertson pp. 160\u2013161\">[[#refRobertson1961|Robertson 1961]], pp. 160\u2013161.</ref>\n\n{{USS|Ward|DD-139}} was an old \"4-piper\" [[destroyer]] commissioned in 1918; the ship used in the movie, {{USS|Finch|DE-328}}, which portrays ''Ward'' looked far different from the original destroyer.<ref>[http://www.usssavagededer386.org/ToraToraTora.html \"Tora, Tora, Tora, Chapter 9.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605000043/http://www.usssavagededer386.org/ToraToraTora.html |date=2013-06-05 }} ''.usssavagededer386.org.''

The [[lattice mast]] (or cage mast) section of the {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|0}}/''Maryland''-class battleship was built beside the set of the USS ''Nevada'' stern section, but not built upon a set of a deck, but on the ground as the footage in the movie only showed the cage [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] tower. The large scale model of the stern shows the two aft gun turrets with three gun barrels in each; in reality, ''Nevada'' had two heightened fore and aft turrets with two barrels each while the lower two turrets fore and aft had three barrels each. Another model of ''Nevada'', used in the film to portray the whole ship, displays the turrets accurately. The reason for this anomaly is because the aft section model was used in the film to portray both USS ''Nevada'' and USS ''Arizona''. The ships looked remarkably similar except that ''Arizona'' had four triple turrets and a slightly different stern section. Footage and photographs not used in the film show the cage mast as being built on the ground. The USS ''Nevada''/USS ''Arizona'' stern section was shown exploding to represent the explosion that destroyed ''Arizona'', although in reality the explosion took place in #2 [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazine|magazine]], forward, and ''Arizona''{{'}}s stern section remains essentially intact to this day.\n\nThe film has a Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter being damaged over a naval base and then deliberately crashing into a naval base hangar. This is actually a composite of three incidents at [[Pearl Harbor attack]]: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero crashed into [[Fort Kamehameha]]'s ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero did deliberately crash into a hillside after U.S. Navy CPO [[John William Finn]] at Naval Air Station at [[K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay]] had shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a Japanese aircraft that was damaged crashed into the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Curtiss|AV-4|6}}.<ref>[[#refCarnes1996|Carnes 1996]], pp. 228\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring a number of shots of the attack squadrons traversing across Oahu, a white cross can be seen standing on one of the mountainsides.

The 2019 film ''[[Midway_(2019_film)|Midway]]'' also features Admiral Yamamoto speaking aloud the sleeping giant quote.

Air Staff Officer [[Minoru Genda]] is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] is selected to lead the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese ''[[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple Code]]'', allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel and General Short do their best to increase defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii.\n\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]] is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]]'s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. The Japanese thus achieve surprise and a joyous commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 a declaration of war \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura|Japanese ambassador]], helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by a despondent Hull.\n\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and ominously concludes: \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\"\n\n==Cast==\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Martin Balsam]]\n|[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Husband E.

Zanuck]], who had earlier produced ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\", with a \"revisionist's approach\". He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, [[Walter Short|General Short]] and [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Kimmel]], though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese. Despite a breakthrough in intelligence, they had received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack.<ref name=\"Parish p. 411\" /> Recognizing that a balanced and objective recounting was necessary, Zanuck developed an American-Japanese co-production, allowing for \"a point of view from both nations\".<ref name=\"Orriss pp. 194\u2013195\" /> He was helped out by his son, [[Richard D.

I felt he was not only uncomfortable directing this kind of movie but also he wasn't used to having somebody tell him how he should make his film. He always had complete autonomy, and nobody would dare make a suggestion to Kurosawa about the budget, or shooting schedule, or anything like that. And then here he was, with Darryl Zanuck on his back and Richard Zanuck on him and Elmo Williams and the production managers, and it was all stuff that he never had run into before, because he was always untouchable. I think he was getting more and more nervous and more insecure about how he was going to work on this film. And of course, the press got a hold of a lot of this unrest on the set and they made a lot out of that in Japan, and it was more pressure on him, and he wasn't used to that kind of pressure.<ref>Galbraith, Stewart. \"[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] interview of Richard Fleischer.\" ''Tora!

These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship's decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: ''Akagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}. This was done because it was known that for the launching scenes filmed in the US, a US carrier would be used and the islands of US carriers were always on the starboard side. A few of the modified aircraft were also converted in Japan for the flight scenes filmed there.\n\nIn preparation for filming, ''Yorktown'' was berthed at [[NAS North Island]] in San Diego to load all the aircraft, maintenance, and film crew prior to sailing to Hawaii. The night before filming the \"Japanese\" take-off scenes she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these \"Japanese\" aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have [[arresting gear]] with which to land back on the carrier, and continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. ''Yorktown'' sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii and the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor. Aircraft Specialties of Mesa, Arizona performed maintenance on the aircraft while in Hawaii.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->\n\nA [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]'s actual crash landing during filming, a result of a jammed landing gear, was filmed and used in the final cut.<ref>http://ww2f.com/threads/about-tora-tora-tora.16059/.

The aircraft stayed aloft to use up as much fuel as possible, which gave the film crew some time to prepare, prior to landing. After viewing the \"single gear\" landing footage they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft used are the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and, especially, the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] (two flyable examples were used). Predominantly, P-40 fighter aircraft are used to depict the U.S. defenders with a full-scale P-40 used as a template for fiberglass replicas (some with working engines and props) that were strafed and blown up during filming.<ref>[[#refHathaway1969|Hathaway 1969]], p. 52.</ref> Fleischer also said a scene involving a P-40 model crashing into the middle of a line of P-40s was unintended, as it was supposed to crash at the end of the line.

This is understandable, however, as both ''Enterprise'' and all six of the Japanese carriers from the attack had been scrapped and sunk, respectively. ''Enterprise'' was scrapped in 1959, and four of the six, including ''Akagi'', were sunk within six months of the attack at the [[Battle of Midway]].\n\nIn ''Tora! Tora!

In addition, the markings do not display the aircraft's identification numbers as was the case in the actual battle. The white surround on the [[roundel]] on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards.

The [[lattice mast]] (or cage mast) section of the {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|0}}/''Maryland''-class battleship was built beside the set of the USS ''Nevada'' stern section, but not built upon a set of a deck, but on the ground as the footage in the movie only showed the cage [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] tower. The large scale model of the stern shows the two aft gun turrets with three gun barrels in each; in reality, ''Nevada'' had two heightened fore and aft turrets with two barrels each while the lower two turrets fore and aft had three barrels each. Another model of ''Nevada'', used in the film to portray the whole ship, displays the turrets accurately. The reason for this anomaly is because the aft section model was used in the film to portray both USS ''Nevada'' and USS ''Arizona''. The ships looked remarkably similar except that ''Arizona'' had four triple turrets and a slightly different stern section. Footage and photographs not used in the film show the cage mast as being built on the ground. The USS ''Nevada''/USS ''Arizona'' stern section was shown exploding to represent the explosion that destroyed ''Arizona'', although in reality the explosion took place in #2 [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazine|magazine]], forward, and ''Arizona''{{'}}s stern section remains essentially intact to this day.\n\nThe film has a Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter being damaged over a naval base and then deliberately crashing into a naval base hangar. This is actually a composite of three incidents at [[Pearl Harbor attack]]: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero crashed into [[Fort Kamehameha]]'s ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero did deliberately crash into a hillside after U.S. Navy CPO [[John William Finn]] at Naval Air Station at [[K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay]] had shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a Japanese aircraft that was damaged crashed into the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Curtiss|AV-4|6}}.<ref>[[#refCarnes1996|Carnes 1996]], pp. 228\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring a number of shots of the attack squadrons traversing across Oahu, a white cross can be seen standing on one of the mountainsides.

The 2019 film ''[[Midway_(2019_film)|Midway]]'' also features Admiral Yamamoto speaking aloud the sleeping giant quote.

In an email, Dr. Nesathurai, who worked for [[Haldimand-Norfolk|Haldimand Norfolk Health Unit]], wrote on March 19 that Ontario's response had undermined the province's attempt to contain the outbreak, as businesses remain open and travellers ignore advice to self-isolate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/03/20/leaked-email-reveals-ontario-regional-medical-officers-criticism-of-provincial-covid-19-strategy-as-cracks-emerge-in-front-line.html|title=Leaked email reveals Ontario regional medical officer\u2019s criticism of provincial COVID-19 strategy as cracks emerge in front line|date=March 20, 2020|website=thestar.com}}</ref> \n\n===Testing issues===\nWhile Ontario initially did not have enough testing centres in Ontario in March to meet demand, that issue was resolved, before there were not enough labs to process the resultant tests, and later, not enough supplies of [[reagent]] to complete the tests.

Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n===Large gatherings banned===\nChurch services\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, large gatherings such as church services have been banned by the government of Ontario. For many people that attend church regularly, online church is beginning to become popular. Churchgoers have relied heavily on online applications to communicate (zoom, google meet, discord, etc.) \n\nFor example, in NYCBC (North York Chinese Baptist Church), the parishioners use Zoom Video Conferencing Software to resume the weekly service. Different users can tune in to the call by using a link provided by the church website. The call is also streamed on youtube. Church service starts with worship. The user that is supposed to lead worship unmutes their microphone, and leads the songs. Instruments such as a piano are often used. The technical team shares their screen, and the lyrics are projected. The other users can sing along, but the mics are muted or else there would be total chaos among the call. There is usually offering (the giving of money to the church) after worship, but since the users are online, the users cannot give their offering in person. The church uses something called pre-authorized debit offering, which takes a certain amount of money out of your account every month. Afterwards, there is the pastoral prayer (where the pastor prays about various things), and then, there is the sermon. \n\nThe pastor (or whoever is preaching on that day) unmutes themselves and delivers the message. Finally, announcements are made. The announcer gives updates on what the church is doing, and where the church is heading. This concludes the church service. Users are welcome to hang around after the service and talk to one another.\n\n===Long-term care homes===\n\n====Background====\nOn April 15, 2020, the [[Ontario Nurses' Association]] released a statement saying that long-term care (LTC) homes pre-COVID-19 were already understaffed, but now they are in \u201ccrisis\u201d mode. Prior to the pandemic, long-term care home staff who were part-time or casual staff were allowed to work at multiple locations, increasing the risk of transmission and spread between LTC homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6820516/coronavirus-ontario-nurses-association-long-term-care-homes/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario Nurses\u2019 Association calls work conditions in care homes \u2018unfathomable\u2019|website=Global News}}</ref> The province issued a new Emergency Order on March 28 that introduced temporary additional staff members to help in the facilities and allowed homes more flexibility in staff deployment.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6775358/nursing-homes-coronavirus-outbreak/|title=Canada\u2019s nursing homes worry coronavirus outbreak will mean residents \u2018dying alone\u2019|website=Global News}}</ref> Many LTC homes in Ontario are considered old and small and feature shared bedrooms, increasing the difficulty in isolating sick residents from those who are well.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/10/ontario-has-ramped-up-testing-infection-control-measures-in-long-term-care-homes-will-it-be-enough.html|title=Ontario has ramped up testing, infection control measures in long-term care homes.

The capital of the [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] [[Baban]] principality (1649\u20131850), before Sulaymaniyah was a territory named \"Qela\u00e7iwalan\". At the time of the Babani's rule there were major conflicts between the [[Safavid dynasty]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Qela\u00e7iwalan became a battleground for the two rivals.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sulygov.com/ |title=The Leading Suly Government Site on the Net |publisher=sulygov.com |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nBeing of strategic importance and lying deep inside Safavid territory, there was concern that Qela\u00e7iwalan would be attacked and captured if the [[Baban]]i did not give the Safavids military support, as both Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and [[Nader Shah]] were trying to gain the support of the dispersed [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] Emirates.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/> This obliged Mahmud Pasha of Baban in 1781 to think about moving the center of its Emirate to another safer place. He chose Melkend\u00ee, then a village but now a district in central Sulaymaniyah, to construct a number of ''Serahs'' for his political and armed units.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/>\n\nIn 1783, [[Ibrahim Pasha Baban|Ibrahim Pasha of Baban]] became ruler of the Emirate and began the construction of a new city which would become the capital of the Baban Emirate. In 1784 he finished erecting a number of palaces for trade called ''Qeyser\u00ees'' and bazaars, which were also used as baths, and began inviting people from the surrounding villages and Emirates to move to the newly established city. Soon Melkend\u00ee, which was originally intended to be the city itself, instead became one of its quarters and still is today.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/> The new city of Sulaymaniyah was named after [[Sulaiman Baba]] who was the first [[Baban]] prince to gain control of the province of [[Shahrizor|\u015earez\u00fbr]] and its capital, [[Kirkuk]]. Sulaiman Baba invaded the neigboring [[Kurds|Kurdish]] vassaldom of [[Ardalan|Erdalan]], defeating their forces in 1694.

The capital of the [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] [[Baban]] principality (1649\u20131850), before Sulaymaniyah was a territory named \"Qela\u00e7iwalan\". At the time of the Babani's rule there were major conflicts between the [[Safavid dynasty]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Qela\u00e7iwalan became a battleground for the two rivals.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sulygov.com/ |title=The Leading Suly Government Site on the Net |publisher=sulygov.com |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nBeing of strategic importance and lying deep inside Safavid territory, there was concern that Qela\u00e7iwalan would be attacked and captured if the [[Baban]]i did not give the Safavids military support, as both Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and [[Nader Shah]] were trying to gain the support of the dispersed [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] Emirates.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/> This obliged Mahmud Pasha of Baban in 1781 to think about moving the center of its Emirate to another safer place. He chose Melkend\u00ee, then a village but now a district in central Sulaymaniyah, to construct a number of ''Serahs'' for his political and armed units.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/>\n\nIn 1783, [[Ibrahim Pasha Baban|Ibrahim Pasha of Baban]] became ruler of the Emirate and began the construction of a new city which would become the capital of the Baban Emirate. In 1784 he finished erecting a number of palaces for trade called ''Qeyser\u00ees'' and bazaars, which were also used as baths, and began inviting people from the surrounding villages and Emirates to move to the newly established city. Soon Melkend\u00ee, which was originally intended to be the city itself, instead became one of its quarters and still is today.<ref name=\"sulygov.com\"/> The new city of Sulaymaniyah was named after [[Sulaiman Baba]] who was the first [[Baban]] prince to gain control of the province of [[Shahrizor|\u015earez\u00fbr]] and its capital, [[Kirkuk]]. Sulaiman Baba invaded the neigboring [[Kurds|Kurdish]] vassaldom of [[Ardalan|Erdalan]], defeating their forces in 1694. Ottoman Sultan [[Mustafa II]] assigned him the district of Baban, which included the town of Kirkuk.<ref>G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston, Bruce Alan Masters (2009), ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', p.70, Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1800s refugees from [[Ardalan]] moved to Sulaymaniyah including [[Mastoureh Ardalan|Mastura Ardalan]], the widow of Xosraw Xan\u00ee Erdalan, the ruler of the kingdom.

On 10 March<ref name=hill/> the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La P\u00e9rouse never met. La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men, women and children and the number included four companies of marines. About 20% of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82. About 50% of the convicts had been tried in Middlesex and most of the rest were tried in the county assizes of Devon, Kent and Sussex\n* '''18 January 1788''' \u2013 The First Fleet arrived in [[Botany Bay]] but the landing party was not impressed with the site, and moved the fleet to [[Port Jackson]], landing in [[Sydney Cove]] on 26 January 1788 (now celebrated as [[Australia Day]]).\n* ''' April 1789''' \u2013 an outbreak of smallpox decimates local tribes.\n* '''1790''' \u2013 the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] of convicts arrives in Sydney Cove.\n* '''1791''' \u2013 [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] of convicts arrives\n* '''1793''' \u2013 January: the first free settlers arrive in NSW.\n* '''1793''' \u2013 March\u2013April: visit of the expedition led by [[Alessandro Malaspina]].\n* '''1825''' - May: Founding of [[Brisbane]]\n* '''14 June 1825''' \u2013 the colony of [[Van Diemen's Land]] is established in its own right; its name is officially changed to [[Tasmania]] on 1 January 1856. The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.<ref name=\"moadoph.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. The reformist [[Attorney General of New South Wales|attorney general]], [[John Plunkett]], sought to apply [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to [[emancipist]]s, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded. In [[Tasmania]], the \"[[Black War]]\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\n== Representations in literature and film ==\n* [[Marcus Clarke]]'s 1874 novel, ''[[For the Term of his Natural Life]]'', and the 1983 television adaptation of the novel.\n* [[Eleanor Dark]]'s 1947 ''Timeless Land'' trilogy, which spans the colonisation from 1788\u20131811.

La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales.

The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England.

The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded.
