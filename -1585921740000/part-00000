{"title_page": "Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l'arm\u00e9e", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=September 2009}}\nThe '''''Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l'arm\u00e9e''''', '''''O.R.A.''''' (Fr: resistance organisation of the army) was a French paramilitary resistance organisation during the [[Second World War]]. It was created on 31 January 1943, following the November 1942 German invasion of the ''[[zone libre]]'' as a self-styled apolitical organisation bringing together former French military personnel in pursuit of active resistance against the German occupiers, but rejecting [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\nThe ORA was founded by General [[Aubert Fr\u00e8re]], president of the tribunal which had condemned de Gaulle to death in August 1940. Fr\u00e8re was arrested in 1943 and deported. He died in [[Struthof]] on 13 June 1944. The ORA's next leader was Major General [[Jean-Edouard Verneau]], who was arrested on 23 October 1943 and died while being deported to [[Buchenwald]] on 14 September 1944. The leadership was then assumed by Major General [[Georges Revers]], whose second was Brigadier General [[Pierre Brisac]].\n\nThe ORA grew quickly in the southern zone, which was not handed over to the Germans, thanks to its officers and armaments acquired from the Vichy army. In 1944, it amalgamated with the [[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (AS) and the [[Francs-tireurs et partisans]] to form the [[French Forces of the Interior]], although it retained its autonomy.\n\n==The initial stages of resistance in the army==\nOn the day after the defeat and the signature of the armistice in 1940, a certain number of French army officers, reduced to a body of 100,000 men, considered that all was not lost. The forces across the French empire were still intact, and the reconquest of France with the help of the allies remained possible. From July, certain services considered preparing the counterstrike.\nColonel Rivet, chief of the ''2 Bureau'' gathered his allies and said to them that the mission against Germany and Italy would continue. \n<!--\nL\u2019\u00e9tat-major, avant que les commissions d\u2019armistice ne se mettent en place, s\u2019efforce d\u2019exp\u00e9dier en Afrique du Nord le plus possible d\u2019armes et de mat\u00e9riel, et effectue des \u00e9tudes sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019un d\u00e9barquement alli\u00e9 en France.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Colson envoie une lettre personnelle manuscrite aux commandants des r\u00e9gions militaires les invitant \u00e0 camoufler du mat\u00e9riel. Plus discr\u00e8tement le commandant Mollard cr\u00e9e un service clandestin de camouflage de mat\u00e9riel (CDM).\n\nLe colonel Du Vigier met sur pied des unit\u00e9s de r\u00e9servistes mobilis\u00e9s sur place, les groupes autod\u00e9fense (GAD) charg\u00e9s de surveiller les mouvements des troupes allemandes en zone occup\u00e9e.\n\nEnfin le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau envisage pour la premi\u00e8re fois la tactique de la gu\u00e9rilla en cas de rupture de l\u2019armistice et l\u2019invasion de la zone sud, avec repli de l\u2019arm\u00e9e de l\u2019armistice dans les zones montagneuses.\n\n==L\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e. Novembre 1942==\nAu lendemain de ce deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9sastre que fut pour l\u2019arm\u00e9e l\u2019envahissement de la zone non occup\u00e9e avec remise de ses armes, un groupe d\u2019officiers anim\u00e9s par les g\u00e9n\u00e9raux Verneau, Grandsard et Olleris d\u00e9cide de cr\u00e9er une organisation militaire clandestine qui deviendra l\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e avec l\u2019aval du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Fr\u00e8re.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Giraud avant de s\u2019embarquer clandestinement pour l\u2019Afrique du Nord d\u00e9signe ce dernier comme son repr\u00e9sentant en France m\u00e9tropolitaine.\n\nL\u2019ann\u00e9e 1943 sera consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la mise en place de l\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e dans les six r\u00e9gions d\u00e9finies par le mouvement Combat en zone sud. Cette tache revient au colonel Pfister pour le sud-ouest et au colonel Zeller pour le sud-est.\n\nEn zone nord l\u2019implantation de l\u2019ORA est plus difficile. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau dirige cette op\u00e9ration. Les implantations les plus importantes sont la Bretagne command\u00e9e par le colonel Masnou, l\u2019Indre et l\u2019Indre-et-Loire avec la brigade du colonel Chomel, la r\u00e9gion du Cher o\u00f9 le colonel Bertrand regroupe les anciens de son r\u00e9giment dissout le 1{{er}} RI, la Bourgogne sous les ordres du colonel Prats. \u00c0 l\u2019est, la r\u00e9gion D, comprenant la Franche-Comt\u00e9, le Jura et les Vosges, est dirig\u00e9e par le colonel Maurin.\n\nD\u00e8s mars 1943 l\u2019ORA entre en rapport avec les autres mouvements de r\u00e9sistance y compris le parti communiste afin de coordonner les actions imm\u00e9diates et futures. La reconnaissance en juin 1943 par l\u2019ORA de la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du CFLN \u00e0 Alger et de l\u2019autorit\u00e9  du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle a facilit\u00e9 ces n\u00e9gociations.\n\nSuivant ses effectifs, l\u2019ORA cr\u00e9e ses propres maquis ou groupes mobilisables ou fournit  aux autres mouvements les officiers n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur encadrement.\n\nCette mise en place ne se fait pas sans casse. En mars 1943 des arrestations massives frappent plus de 50 officiers. En juin les services de l\u2019Abwehr arr\u00eatent les g\u00e9n\u00e9raux Olleris, Gilliot et Fr\u00e8re. Ce dernier mourra au camp du [[Struthof]]. En juillet ce sera le tour du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Grandsard, puis en octobre du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau qui lui non plus ne reviendra pas de d\u00e9portation. Il sera remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l\u2019ORA par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revers.\n\n==Lutte ouverte - 6 juin 1944==\n===Le d\u00e9barquement===\nLe 5 juin, le haut commandement alli\u00e9 diffuse les messages donnant l\u2019ordre d\u2019appliquer tous les plans de destructions pr\u00e9vus et de d\u00e9clencher la gu\u00e9rilla sur l\u2019ensemble du territoire fran\u00e7ais.\n\n====La Normandie====\nLa zone de d\u00e9barquement, c'est-\u00e0-dire le Calvados et les quelques kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s de la Manche, n\u2019est pas propice aux maquis en raison de la forte concentration des forces allemandes et des bombardements intenses alli\u00e9s.\n\nC\u2019est le plan Tortue, mis au point par le capitaine Grenier install\u00e9 \u00e0 [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]], qui sera appliqu\u00e9 par les \u00e9quipes du colonel Perret. Elles retarderont de 48 heures l\u2019arriv\u00e9e sur le front de la Panzer division stationn\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Mans, retard qui contribuera au succ\u00e8s de l\u2019[[op\u00e9ration Overlord]]. Un rapport du capitaine Fayard fait \u00e9tat de la destruction de huit ponts routiers, d\u2019une centaine de v\u00e9hicules, de sabotages de voies ferr\u00e9es et de rupture de c\u00e2bles t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques dans les jours qui ont suivi le d\u00e9barquement.\n\n====La Bretagne====\nEn Bretagne, la R\u00e9sistance, bien que non avertie de l\u2019op\u00e9ration, apporte une aide pr\u00e9cieuse aux parachutistes fran\u00e7ais du 4th [[Special Air Service|SAS]]. Ceux-ci, dans le cadre des op\u00e9rations [[op\u00e9ration Dingson|Dingson]] et [[op\u00e9ration Samwest|Samwest]], doivent selon les plans alli\u00e9s fixer les troupes allemandes stationn\u00e9es en Bretagne, en y effectuant des sabotages et des escarmouches, afin de cr\u00e9er un deuxi\u00e8me front ou du moins d'en cr\u00e9er l'illusion, vu le faible nombre d'hommes disponibles.\n\nQuatre \u00ab sticks \u00bb de parachutistes issus de la [[France libre]], pr\u00e9curseurs des arm\u00e9es alli\u00e9es, parachut\u00e9s dans la nuit du 5 au 6 juin avant toutes les autres forces alli\u00e9es, sont pris en charge par la R\u00e9sistance qui dispose de plusieurs milliers d'hommes des [[Francs-tireurs et partisans|FTP]], de l'[[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] et de l'ORA.\n\nIls sont suivis par le largage de pr\u00e8s de 400 autres SAS, qui avec les groupes de r\u00e9sistants effectuent de nombreuses actions de sabotages et embuscades. L\u2019\u00e9norme sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 allemande les contraint \u00e0 \u00e9vacuer leurs deux bases de commandement, [[Duault]] ([[C\u00f4tes-du-Nord]]), puis [[Saint-Marcel (Morbihan)]].\n\nC\u2019est \u00e0 Saint-Marcel que le commandant [[Bourgoin|Pierre-Louis Bourgoin]] sera parachut\u00e9 avec le reste de ses hommes ainsi que plusieurs tonnes de mat\u00e9riel, dont des [[Jeep]]s. Cette base comptera jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3500 hommes arm\u00e9s, l\u2019ORA lui fournissant quatre bataillons. Ceux-ci participeront \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense et \u00e0 son \u00e9vacuation particuli\u00e8rement difficile le 18 juin. Dispers\u00e9es, les forces de la R\u00e9sistance et les hommes de Bourgouin rallieront diff\u00e9rents maquis, et poursuivront la lutte par une action g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e0 partir du 3 ao\u00fbt jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de la Bretagne. Trois bataillons ORA participeront d'ailleurs au si\u00e8ge de Lorient.\n\n===La Lib\u00e9ration===\n====Le sud de la Loire====\nAu sud de la Loire, l\u2019ORA, qui s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e l\u00e0 o\u00f9 stationnaient les unit\u00e9s de l\u2019arm\u00e9e d'armistice avant sa dissolution, effectue une s\u00e9rie de sabotages (dynamitage de ponts, obstructions des routes, destructions de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de carburants) afin de retarder la mont\u00e9e des renforts allemands vers le front de Normandie. Apr\u00e8s le 15 ao\u00fbt, la r\u00e9ception de nombreux parachutages d\u2019armes permet le d\u00e9clenchement  de la gu\u00e9rilla g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et notamment la constitution de deux unit\u00e9s importantes : la Brigade ''Charles Martel'' command\u00e9e par le colonel Chomel forte de 2&nbsp;300 hommes dans l\u2019[[Indre (d\u00e9partement)|Indre]], et le 1{{er}} RI reconstitu\u00e9 par le colonel Bertrand disposant de 11 compagnies dans le [[Cher (d\u00e9partement)|Cher]].\n\nD\u2019autre part dans le sud-ouest, apr\u00e8s la lib\u00e9ration de Toulouse, le 19 ao\u00fbt, sous l\u2019impulsion de Chevance-Bertin, les FFI des r\u00e9gions lib\u00e9r\u00e9es (dont le [[Corps franc]] Pommi\u00e8s) sont regroup\u00e9s pour former une grande unit\u00e9 de combat : le Groupement mobile du Sud-Ouest compos\u00e9 de deux divisions :\n*la division l\u00e9g\u00e8re de Toulouse command\u00e9e par le colonel Redon de l\u2019ORA,\n*la division l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u2019Auvergne command\u00e9e par le colonel Roger Fayard, lui aussi de l'ORA.\n\nL\u2019ensemble de ces forces participe \u00e0 une importante op\u00e9ration qui aboutira \u00e0 la reddition d\u2019une colonne allemande forte de 20&nbsp;000 hommes command\u00e9s par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster. Partie de Bordeaux le 22 ao\u00fbt, cette colonne, h\u00e9t\u00e9roclite mais fortement arm\u00e9e, est harcel\u00e9e dans la Vienne par les maquis de Guingouin, puis dans l\u2019Indre par la brigade ''Charles Martel'' de Chomel. Ce dernier ayant \u00e9tabli une liaison radio avec les Am\u00e9ricains gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une \u00e9quipe [[Jedburgh]] obtient un appui de bombardements a\u00e9riens obligeant Elster \u00e0 ne faire mouvement que la nuit. Dans le Cher, la colonne se heurte au 1{{er}} RI renforc\u00e9 par deux escadrons de Jeeps fournis par les SAS de Bourgouin, d\u00e9sormais colonel.\n\nLes divisions Fayard et Redon se d\u00e9ploient sur une ligne Saincoins et le Bec de l\u2019Allier. L\u2019ensemble de ce dispositif FFI, bien qu'inf\u00e9rieur en nombre et armes, emp\u00eache Elster (dont les troupes s\u2019\u00e9chelonnent entre Cher et Loire) de franchir la Loire \u00e0 [[Decize]].\n\nD\u2019autre part une autre colonne allemande, forte de 5&nbsp;000 hommes et command\u00e9e par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bauer, remonte vers [[Autun]]. Elle est attaqu\u00e9e par les FTP de [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], puis par le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] transport\u00e9 par train (prouesse de [[R\u00e9sistance-Fer]]) et par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la 1{{re}} DB (le 2{{e}} Dragon du colonel Demetz) charg\u00e9s de s\u2019emparer d\u2019Autun. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bauer se rend sans condition le 10 septembre au colonel Demetz qu\u2019entourent les chefs FFI.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster priv\u00e9 de l\u2019appui de Bauer accepte de se rendre le m\u00eame jour au g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Macon commandant la 83{{e}} D.I. US \u00e0 [[Issoudun]] en pr\u00e9sence du colonel Chomel. Le lendemain, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster doit n\u00e9gocier \u00e0 [[Ar\u00e7ay (Cher)]] avec le colonel Bertrand les conditions de ses mouvements pour se rendre aux Am\u00e9ricains.\n\nDans la r\u00e9gion R4 (sud-ouest) au re\u00e7u des messages de Londres, la mobilisation se fait dans l\u2019enthousiasme. Aux points de ralliement, on assiste \u00e0 une arriv\u00e9e massive d\u2019hommes que l\u2019on ne peut tous armer. Les brigades de Pommi\u00e8s montent plus de vingt embuscades et font face \u00e0 de nombreux accrochages, les sabotages de voies ferr\u00e9es et la destruction de pyl\u00f4nes se multiplient dans toute la r\u00e9gion jusque la fin juin. C\u2019est davantage par manque d\u2019armes et d\u2019explosifs que Pommi\u00e8s ordonne une d\u00e9mobilisation partielle et un repli sur des maquis hors de port\u00e9e des garnisons allemandes.\n\nLes Allemands par contre, surpris par le nombre des premi\u00e8res actions du corps franc r\u00e9agissent avec force en constituant des d\u00e9tachements anti-gu\u00e9rilla aid\u00e9s par la [[Milice]] de Darnand. Fin juillet, les parachutages d\u2019armes permettent la reconstitution de nombreuses unit\u00e9s et la reprise des embuscades. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9barquement alli\u00e9 du 15 ao\u00fbt, en liaison avec les autres groupes de r\u00e9sistance (FTP, AS, CFL, VENY), le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] va participer \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de nombreuses villes et interdire la [[fronti\u00e8re franco-espagnole]] aux unit\u00e9s allemandes qui chercheraient refuge en Espagne. Apr\u00e8s la bataille d\u2019Autun, le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] devient le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s|49{{e}} R\u00e9giment d\u2019infanterie]] rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 la  1{{re}} Arm\u00e9e. Il participe \u00e0 la campagne d\u2019Allemagne et d\u00e9filera \u00e0 Berlin le 8 mai 1945.\n\n====Le Sud-Est====\nDans la R\u00e9gion R2 Provence-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur le capitaine [[Jacques L\u00e9cuyer]] ordonne d\u00e8s l\u2019annonce du d\u00e9barquement en Normandie la mobilisation des maquis dans les zones montagneuses. De violents combats ont lieu dans la [[vall\u00e9e de l'Ubaye]], les gorges du [[Cians]] et de [[Daluis]], le [[Verdon (rivi\u00e8re)#Haut Verdon|Haut Verdon]] et plus au nord dans le [[Vaucluse (d\u00e9partement)|Vaucluse]]. D\u00e8s la fin juillet, il r\u00e8gne dans toute la r\u00e9gion alpine un climat d\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 total pour les troupes allemandes. Le colonel Zeller, chef ORA pour les Alpes d\u00e9cide de se rendre \u00e0 Alger voir le [[g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle]] pour lui exposer cette situation. Celui-ci d\u00e9voile \u00e0 ce dernier que le [[d\u00e9barquement en Provence]] est fix\u00e9 au 15 ao\u00fbt et que le plan  pr\u00e9voit une lente remont\u00e9e par la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne pour atteindre Lyon \u00e0 J+90. Aussi Zeller sugg\u00e8re une man\u0153uvre audacieuse et rapide, \u00e0 travers la zone alpine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par les maquis, avec un rabattement brusque le plus au nord possible pour couper la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et atteindre Lyon \u00e0 J+15 au maximum. De Gaulle approuve et demande \u00e0 Zeller d\u2019aller \u00e0 Naples exposer ce plan au [[Alexander Patch|g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Patch]], commandant des forces de d\u00e9barquement. Celui-ci  lui dit qu\u2019il ne peut modifier le plan initial mais qu\u2019il d\u00e9cidera sur place de l\u2019action \u00e0 entreprendre. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9barquement, Lecuyer, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un important agent du S.O.E., le major Gun, se pr\u00e9sente au PC du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Frederick dont la First Airborne Task Force venait d\u2019\u00eatre parachut\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Muy. Ils lui confirment que son flanc droit nord est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la r\u00e9sistance jusqu\u2019au confluent du Var et de la V\u00e9subie. Une mission similaire est effectu\u00e9e par le major Gun et le lieutenant de Boisfleury aupr\u00e8s du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[John E. Dahlquist|Dahlquist]], commandant la 36{{e}} D.I. US pour lui confirmer que la route des Alpes est quasiment libre, contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par les maquis. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Patch encore en mer d\u00e9cide alors d\u2019envoyer une importante brigade motoris\u00e9e command\u00e9e par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Butler, qui arrivera devant Lyon le 3 septembre soit plus de deux mois avant la date pr\u00e9vue.\n\n====L'Est====\nDans l\u2019est le colonel Maurin commande, outre la Franche-Comt\u00e9, le Haut-Rhin et les Vosges. Ayant re\u00e7u peu d\u2019armes, il d\u00e9cide de ne pas appliquer le Plan Rouge imm\u00e9diatement, mais de consacrer tous ses efforts aux op\u00e9rations de sabotages des voies de communication et de destructions de mat\u00e9riel. En juillet et ao\u00fbt, les parachutages massifs d\u2019armes permettent la constitution d\u2019un important maquis sur le plateau de Lhomont rassemblant plus de 3&nbsp;000 hommes, et qui recevra un commando SAS de 82 parachutistes. Cette force effectue de nombreux coups de main contre de petites garnisons allemandes et fait face \u00e0 deux importantes attaques avant de remettre cette position strat\u00e9gique \u00e0 la 1{{re}} Arm\u00e9e.\n\n==Bilan==\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, l\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e a particip\u00e9 aux combats de la Lib\u00e9ration soit avec ses propres forces ([[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]], brigade Charles Martel, 1{{er}} RI.), soit en fournissant des cadres aux maquis ou en participant au commandement des op\u00e9rations (Vercors , R\u00e9gion R2, Division L\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u2019Auvergne). Les exemples cit\u00e9s ne sont qu\u2019un aper\u00e7u de l\u2019action de l\u2019ORA sur l\u2019ensemble du territoire.\n\nPar ailleurs, il faut souligner, que l\u2019ORA n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un mouvement comme le furent [[Combat (r\u00e9sistance)|Combat]], [[Lib\u00e9ration]], [[Franc-Tireur]], le [[Front national (r\u00e9sistance)|Front National]] et bien d\u2019autres encore, avec leurs journaux, leurs pr\u00e9occupations politiques et leurs unit\u00e9s combattantes, mais un ensemble militaire clandestin organis\u00e9 m\u00e9thodiquement apr\u00e8s novembre 1942 mais pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d\u00e8s juillet 1940 par certains chefs de l\u2019arm\u00e9e d'armistice.

(Fr: resistance organisation of the army) was a French paramilitary resistance organisation during the [[Second World War]]. It was created on 31 January 1943, following the November 1942 German invasion of the ''[[zone libre]]'' as a self-styled apolitical organisation bringing together former French military personnel in pursuit of active resistance against the German occupiers, but rejecting [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\nThe ORA was founded by General [[Aubert Fr\u00e8re]], president of the tribunal which had condemned de Gaulle to death in August 1940. Fr\u00e8re was arrested in 1943 and deported. He died in [[Struthof]] on 13 June 1944. The ORA's next leader was Major General [[Jean-Edouard Verneau]], who was arrested on 23 October 1943 and died while being deported to [[Buchenwald]] on 14 September 1944. The leadership was then assumed by Major General [[Georges Revers]], whose second was Brigadier General [[Pierre Brisac]].\n\nThe ORA grew quickly in the southern zone, which was not handed over to the Germans, thanks to its officers and armaments acquired from the Vichy army. In 1944, it amalgamated with the [[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (AS) and the [[Francs-tireurs et partisans]] to form the [[French Forces of the Interior]], although it retained its autonomy.\n\n==The initial stages of resistance in the army==\nOn the day after the defeat and the signature of the armistice in 1940, a certain number of French army officers, reduced to a body of 100,000 men, considered that all was not lost. The forces across the French empire were still intact, and the reconquest of France with the help of the allies remained possible. From July, certain services considered preparing the counterstrike.\nColonel Rivet, chief of the ''2 Bureau'' gathered his allies and said to them that the mission against Germany and Italy would continue. \n<!--\nL\u2019\u00e9tat-major, avant que les commissions d\u2019armistice ne se mettent en place, s\u2019efforce d\u2019exp\u00e9dier en Afrique du Nord le plus possible d\u2019armes et de mat\u00e9riel, et effectue des \u00e9tudes sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019un d\u00e9barquement alli\u00e9 en France.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Colson envoie une lettre personnelle manuscrite aux commandants des r\u00e9gions militaires les invitant \u00e0 camoufler du mat\u00e9riel. Plus discr\u00e8tement le commandant Mollard cr\u00e9e un service clandestin de camouflage de mat\u00e9riel (CDM).\n\nLe colonel Du Vigier met sur pied des unit\u00e9s de r\u00e9servistes mobilis\u00e9s sur place, les groupes autod\u00e9fense (GAD) charg\u00e9s de surveiller les mouvements des troupes allemandes en zone occup\u00e9e.\n\nEnfin le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau envisage pour la premi\u00e8re fois la tactique de la gu\u00e9rilla en cas de rupture de l\u2019armistice et l\u2019invasion de la zone sud, avec repli de l\u2019arm\u00e9e de l\u2019armistice dans les zones montagneuses.\n\n==L\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e. Novembre 1942==\nAu lendemain de ce deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9sastre que fut pour l\u2019arm\u00e9e l\u2019envahissement de la zone non occup\u00e9e avec remise de ses armes, un groupe d\u2019officiers anim\u00e9s par les g\u00e9n\u00e9raux Verneau, Grandsard et Olleris d\u00e9cide de cr\u00e9er une organisation militaire clandestine qui deviendra l\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e avec l\u2019aval du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Fr\u00e8re.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Giraud avant de s\u2019embarquer clandestinement pour l\u2019Afrique du Nord d\u00e9signe ce dernier comme son repr\u00e9sentant en France m\u00e9tropolitaine.\n\nL\u2019ann\u00e9e 1943 sera consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la mise en place de l\u2019Organisation de r\u00e9sistance de l\u2019arm\u00e9e dans les six r\u00e9gions d\u00e9finies par le mouvement Combat en zone sud. Cette tache revient au colonel Pfister pour le sud-ouest et au colonel Zeller pour le sud-est.\n\nEn zone nord l\u2019implantation de l\u2019ORA est plus difficile. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau dirige cette op\u00e9ration. Les implantations les plus importantes sont la Bretagne command\u00e9e par le colonel Masnou, l\u2019Indre et l\u2019Indre-et-Loire avec la brigade du colonel Chomel, la r\u00e9gion du Cher o\u00f9 le colonel Bertrand regroupe les anciens de son r\u00e9giment dissout le 1{{er}} RI, la Bourgogne sous les ordres du colonel Prats. \u00c0 l\u2019est, la r\u00e9gion D, comprenant la Franche-Comt\u00e9, le Jura et les Vosges, est dirig\u00e9e par le colonel Maurin.\n\nD\u00e8s mars 1943 l\u2019ORA entre en rapport avec les autres mouvements de r\u00e9sistance y compris le parti communiste afin de coordonner les actions imm\u00e9diates et futures. La reconnaissance en juin 1943 par l\u2019ORA de la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du CFLN \u00e0 Alger et de l\u2019autorit\u00e9  du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle a facilit\u00e9 ces n\u00e9gociations.\n\nSuivant ses effectifs, l\u2019ORA cr\u00e9e ses propres maquis ou groupes mobilisables ou fournit  aux autres mouvements les officiers n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur encadrement.\n\nCette mise en place ne se fait pas sans casse. En mars 1943 des arrestations massives frappent plus de 50 officiers. En juin les services de l\u2019Abwehr arr\u00eatent les g\u00e9n\u00e9raux Olleris, Gilliot et Fr\u00e8re. Ce dernier mourra au camp du [[Struthof]]. En juillet ce sera le tour du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Grandsard, puis en octobre du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Verneau qui lui non plus ne reviendra pas de d\u00e9portation. Il sera remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l\u2019ORA par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revers.\n\n==Lutte ouverte - 6 juin 1944==\n===Le d\u00e9barquement===\nLe 5 juin, le haut commandement alli\u00e9 diffuse les messages donnant l\u2019ordre d\u2019appliquer tous les plans de destructions pr\u00e9vus et de d\u00e9clencher la gu\u00e9rilla sur l\u2019ensemble du territoire fran\u00e7ais.\n\n====La Normandie====\nLa zone de d\u00e9barquement, c'est-\u00e0-dire le Calvados et les quelques kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s de la Manche, n\u2019est pas propice aux maquis en raison de la forte concentration des forces allemandes et des bombardements intenses alli\u00e9s.\n\nC\u2019est le plan Tortue, mis au point par le capitaine Grenier install\u00e9 \u00e0 [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]], qui sera appliqu\u00e9 par les \u00e9quipes du colonel Perret. Elles retarderont de 48 heures l\u2019arriv\u00e9e sur le front de la Panzer division stationn\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Mans, retard qui contribuera au succ\u00e8s de l\u2019[[op\u00e9ration Overlord]]. Un rapport du capitaine Fayard fait \u00e9tat de la destruction de huit ponts routiers, d\u2019une centaine de v\u00e9hicules, de sabotages de voies ferr\u00e9es et de rupture de c\u00e2bles t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques dans les jours qui ont suivi le d\u00e9barquement.\n\n====La Bretagne====\nEn Bretagne, la R\u00e9sistance, bien que non avertie de l\u2019op\u00e9ration, apporte une aide pr\u00e9cieuse aux parachutistes fran\u00e7ais du 4th [[Special Air Service|SAS]]. Ceux-ci, dans le cadre des op\u00e9rations [[op\u00e9ration Dingson|Dingson]] et [[op\u00e9ration Samwest|Samwest]], doivent selon les plans alli\u00e9s fixer les troupes allemandes stationn\u00e9es en Bretagne, en y effectuant des sabotages et des escarmouches, afin de cr\u00e9er un deuxi\u00e8me front ou du moins d'en cr\u00e9er l'illusion, vu le faible nombre d'hommes disponibles.\n\nQuatre \u00ab sticks \u00bb de parachutistes issus de la [[France libre]], pr\u00e9curseurs des arm\u00e9es alli\u00e9es, parachut\u00e9s dans la nuit du 5 au 6 juin avant toutes les autres forces alli\u00e9es, sont pris en charge par la R\u00e9sistance qui dispose de plusieurs milliers d'hommes des [[Francs-tireurs et partisans|FTP]], de l'[[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] et de l'ORA.\n\nIls sont suivis par le largage de pr\u00e8s de 400 autres SAS, qui avec les groupes de r\u00e9sistants effectuent de nombreuses actions de sabotages et embuscades. L\u2019\u00e9norme sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 allemande les contraint \u00e0 \u00e9vacuer leurs deux bases de commandement, [[Duault]] ([[C\u00f4tes-du-Nord]]), puis [[Saint-Marcel (Morbihan)]].\n\nC\u2019est \u00e0 Saint-Marcel que le commandant [[Bourgoin|Pierre-Louis Bourgoin]] sera parachut\u00e9 avec le reste de ses hommes ainsi que plusieurs tonnes de mat\u00e9riel, dont des [[Jeep]]s. Cette base comptera jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3500 hommes arm\u00e9s, l\u2019ORA lui fournissant quatre bataillons. Ceux-ci participeront \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense et \u00e0 son \u00e9vacuation particuli\u00e8rement difficile le 18 juin. Dispers\u00e9es, les forces de la R\u00e9sistance et les hommes de Bourgouin rallieront diff\u00e9rents maquis, et poursuivront la lutte par une action g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00e0 partir du 3 ao\u00fbt jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de la Bretagne. Trois bataillons ORA participeront d'ailleurs au si\u00e8ge de Lorient.\n\n===La Lib\u00e9ration===\n====Le sud de la Loire====\nAu sud de la Loire, l\u2019ORA, qui s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e l\u00e0 o\u00f9 stationnaient les unit\u00e9s de l\u2019arm\u00e9e d'armistice avant sa dissolution, effectue une s\u00e9rie de sabotages (dynamitage de ponts, obstructions des routes, destructions de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de carburants) afin de retarder la mont\u00e9e des renforts allemands vers le front de Normandie. Apr\u00e8s le 15 ao\u00fbt, la r\u00e9ception de nombreux parachutages d\u2019armes permet le d\u00e9clenchement  de la gu\u00e9rilla g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et notamment la constitution de deux unit\u00e9s importantes : la Brigade ''Charles Martel'' command\u00e9e par le colonel Chomel forte de 2&nbsp;300 hommes dans l\u2019[[Indre (d\u00e9partement)|Indre]], et le 1{{er}} RI reconstitu\u00e9 par le colonel Bertrand disposant de 11 compagnies dans le [[Cher (d\u00e9partement)|Cher]].\n\nD\u2019autre part dans le sud-ouest, apr\u00e8s la lib\u00e9ration de Toulouse, le 19 ao\u00fbt, sous l\u2019impulsion de Chevance-Bertin, les FFI des r\u00e9gions lib\u00e9r\u00e9es (dont le [[Corps franc]] Pommi\u00e8s) sont regroup\u00e9s pour former une grande unit\u00e9 de combat : le Groupement mobile du Sud-Ouest compos\u00e9 de deux divisions :\n*la division l\u00e9g\u00e8re de Toulouse command\u00e9e par le colonel Redon de l\u2019ORA,\n*la division l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u2019Auvergne command\u00e9e par le colonel Roger Fayard, lui aussi de l'ORA.\n\nL\u2019ensemble de ces forces participe \u00e0 une importante op\u00e9ration qui aboutira \u00e0 la reddition d\u2019une colonne allemande forte de 20&nbsp;000 hommes command\u00e9s par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster. Partie de Bordeaux le 22 ao\u00fbt, cette colonne, h\u00e9t\u00e9roclite mais fortement arm\u00e9e, est harcel\u00e9e dans la Vienne par les maquis de Guingouin, puis dans l\u2019Indre par la brigade ''Charles Martel'' de Chomel. Ce dernier ayant \u00e9tabli une liaison radio avec les Am\u00e9ricains gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une \u00e9quipe [[Jedburgh]] obtient un appui de bombardements a\u00e9riens obligeant Elster \u00e0 ne faire mouvement que la nuit. Dans le Cher, la colonne se heurte au 1{{er}} RI renforc\u00e9 par deux escadrons de Jeeps fournis par les SAS de Bourgouin, d\u00e9sormais colonel.\n\nLes divisions Fayard et Redon se d\u00e9ploient sur une ligne Saincoins et le Bec de l\u2019Allier. L\u2019ensemble de ce dispositif FFI, bien qu'inf\u00e9rieur en nombre et armes, emp\u00eache Elster (dont les troupes s\u2019\u00e9chelonnent entre Cher et Loire) de franchir la Loire \u00e0 [[Decize]].\n\nD\u2019autre part une autre colonne allemande, forte de 5&nbsp;000 hommes et command\u00e9e par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bauer, remonte vers [[Autun]]. Elle est attaqu\u00e9e par les FTP de [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], puis par le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] transport\u00e9 par train (prouesse de [[R\u00e9sistance-Fer]]) et par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la 1{{re}} DB (le 2{{e}} Dragon du colonel Demetz) charg\u00e9s de s\u2019emparer d\u2019Autun. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bauer se rend sans condition le 10 septembre au colonel Demetz qu\u2019entourent les chefs FFI.\n\nLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster priv\u00e9 de l\u2019appui de Bauer accepte de se rendre le m\u00eame jour au g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Macon commandant la 83{{e}} D.I. US \u00e0 [[Issoudun]] en pr\u00e9sence du colonel Chomel. Le lendemain, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Elster doit n\u00e9gocier \u00e0 [[Ar\u00e7ay (Cher)]] avec le colonel Bertrand les conditions de ses mouvements pour se rendre aux Am\u00e9ricains.\n\nDans la r\u00e9gion R4 (sud-ouest) au re\u00e7u des messages de Londres, la mobilisation se fait dans l\u2019enthousiasme. Aux points de ralliement, on assiste \u00e0 une arriv\u00e9e massive d\u2019hommes que l\u2019on ne peut tous armer. Les brigades de Pommi\u00e8s montent plus de vingt embuscades et font face \u00e0 de nombreux accrochages, les sabotages de voies ferr\u00e9es et la destruction de pyl\u00f4nes se multiplient dans toute la r\u00e9gion jusque la fin juin. C\u2019est davantage par manque d\u2019armes et d\u2019explosifs que Pommi\u00e8s ordonne une d\u00e9mobilisation partielle et un repli sur des maquis hors de port\u00e9e des garnisons allemandes.\n\nLes Allemands par contre, surpris par le nombre des premi\u00e8res actions du corps franc r\u00e9agissent avec force en constituant des d\u00e9tachements anti-gu\u00e9rilla aid\u00e9s par la [[Milice]] de Darnand. Fin juillet, les parachutages d\u2019armes permettent la reconstitution de nombreuses unit\u00e9s et la reprise des embuscades. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9barquement alli\u00e9 du 15 ao\u00fbt, en liaison avec les autres groupes de r\u00e9sistance (FTP, AS, CFL, VENY), le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] va participer \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de nombreuses villes et interdire la [[fronti\u00e8re franco-espagnole]] aux unit\u00e9s allemandes qui chercheraient refuge en Espagne. Apr\u00e8s la bataille d\u2019Autun, le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s]] devient le [[corps franc Pommi\u00e8s|49{{e}} R\u00e9giment d\u2019infanterie]] rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 la  1{{re}} Arm\u00e9e. Il participe \u00e0 la campagne d\u2019Allemagne et d\u00e9filera \u00e0 Berlin le 8 mai 1945.\n\n====Le Sud-Est====\nDans la R\u00e9gion R2 Provence-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur le capitaine [[Jacques L\u00e9cuyer]] ordonne d\u00e8s l\u2019annonce du d\u00e9barquement en Normandie la mobilisation des maquis dans les zones montagneuses. De violents combats ont lieu dans la [[vall\u00e9e de l'Ubaye]], les gorges du [[Cians]] et de [[Daluis]], le [[Verdon (rivi\u00e8re)#Haut Verdon|Haut Verdon]] et plus au nord dans le [[Vaucluse (d\u00e9partement)|Vaucluse]]. D\u00e8s la fin juillet, il r\u00e8gne dans toute la r\u00e9gion alpine un climat d\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 total pour les troupes allemandes. Le colonel Zeller, chef ORA pour les Alpes d\u00e9cide de se rendre \u00e0 Alger voir le [[g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle]] pour lui exposer cette situation. Celui-ci d\u00e9voile \u00e0 ce dernier que le [[d\u00e9barquement en Provence]] est fix\u00e9 au 15 ao\u00fbt et que le plan  pr\u00e9voit une lente remont\u00e9e par la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne pour atteindre Lyon \u00e0 J+90. Aussi Zeller sugg\u00e8re une man\u0153uvre audacieuse et rapide, \u00e0 travers la zone alpine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par les maquis, avec un rabattement brusque le plus au nord possible pour couper la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et atteindre Lyon \u00e0 J+15 au maximum. De Gaulle approuve et demande \u00e0 Zeller d\u2019aller \u00e0 Naples exposer ce plan au [[Alexander Patch|g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Patch]], commandant des forces de d\u00e9barquement. Celui-ci  lui dit qu\u2019il ne peut modifier le plan initial mais qu\u2019il d\u00e9cidera sur place de l\u2019action \u00e0 entreprendre. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9barquement, Lecuyer, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un important agent du S.O.E., le major Gun, se pr\u00e9sente au PC du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Frederick dont la First Airborne Task Force venait d\u2019\u00eatre parachut\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Muy. Ils lui confirment que son flanc droit nord est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la r\u00e9sistance jusqu\u2019au confluent du Var et de la V\u00e9subie. Une mission similaire est effectu\u00e9e par le major Gun et le lieutenant de Boisfleury aupr\u00e8s du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[John E. Dahlquist|Dahlquist]], commandant la 36{{e}} D.I. US pour lui confirmer que la route des Alpes est quasiment libre, contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par les maquis. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Patch encore en mer d\u00e9cide alors d\u2019envoyer une importante brigade motoris\u00e9e command\u00e9e par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Butler, qui arrivera devant Lyon le 3 septembre soit plus de deux mois avant la date pr\u00e9vue.\n\n====L'Est====\nDans l\u2019est le colonel Maurin commande, outre la Franche-Comt\u00e9, le Haut-Rhin et les Vosges.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

[[specific gravity]]):\n\n<blockquote>If the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s.

In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]].

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.

[[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]].

The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].

Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s. However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\nIn 1914, [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] attempted to unify gravity and [[electromagnetism]] in [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] gravitation.{{efn|In [[string theory]], dimensions exceeding four allow for the existence of [[Multiverse|parallel realities]]\u2014which along with the [[anthropic principle]], help to explain the statistical near-impossibility of our [[fine-tuned universe]].}} This was superseded by general relativity in 1919, when [[gravitational lens]]ing around a solar eclipse was observed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] promoted the idea of general relativity with a fifth dimension, which in 1921 Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of in a prototypical [[string theory]], a possible model of [[quantum gravity]] and potential theory of everything.\n\n[[Einstein's field equations]] include a [[cosmological constant]] to account for the alleged [[static universe|staticity of the universe]].

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

''The Secret Agent'' is one of Conrad's later political novels in which he moved away from his former tales of [[Seamanship|seafaring]]. The novel is dedicated to [[H. G. Wells]] and deals broadly with [[anarchism]], [[espionage]] and [[terrorism]].{{Sfn | Conrad | 2004 | p = xiv}} It also deals with exploitation of the vulnerable in Verloc's relationship with his brother-in-law Stevie, who has a [[intellectual disability|learning difficulty]]. Conrad\u2019s gloomy portrait of London depicted in the novel was influenced by Charles Dickens\u2019 ''[[Bleak House]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Dickens: Eminently Adaptable but Quite Inimitable; Dostoyevsky to Disney, The Dickensian Legacy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/22/books/critics-notebook-charles-dickens-eminently-adaptable-but-quite-inimitable.html |accessdate=3 April 2020 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe novel was modified as a stage play by Conrad himself and has since been adapted for film, TV, radio and opera.<ref name=\"SabotageHitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-sabotage-1936|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors\u2019 Guide: Sabotage (1936)|work=Brenton Film}}</ref>\n\nBecause of its terrorism theme, it was one of the three works of literature most cited in the American media two weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Judith | last = Shulevitz | title = Chasing After Conrad's Secret Agent | date = 27 September 2001 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/116220/ | newspaper = Slate}}.</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nSet in London in 1886, the novel follows the life of Adolf Verloc, a [[secret agent]]. Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives and [[bric-a-brac]]. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possibly [[autism]],<ref>{{citation | issue = 4 | title = Autism in literature | first = G Patrick | last = Farrell | date =     1 December 1985 | DOI = 10.1007/BF01531790 | ISSN = 1573-3432 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 15 | page = 441 | publisher = Springer }}</ref> which causes him to be excitable; his sister, Verloc's wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc's friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and \"The Professor\" are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produces anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitled ''F.P.'', an acronym for ''The Future of the Proletariat''.\n\nThe novel begins in Verloc's home, as he and his wife discuss the trivialities of everyday life, which introduces the reader to Verloc's family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country.  Although a member of an anarchist cell, Verloc is also secretly employed by the Embassy as an [[agent provocateur]]. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation \u2013 the destruction of [[Greenwich Observatory]] by a bomb. Vladimir explains that Britain's lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and he reasons that an attack on 'science', the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of a communist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc's brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.\n\nThe novel flashes forward to after the bombing has taken place. Comrade Ossipon meets The Professor, who discusses having given explosives to Verloc. The Professor describes the nature of the bomb he carries in his coat at all times: it allows him to press a button which will kill him and those nearest to him in twenty seconds.  After The Professor leaves the meeting, he stumbles into [[Chief Inspector]] Heat, a policeman investigating a recent explosion at Greenwich, where one man was killed.  Heat informs The Professor that he is not a suspect in the case, but that he is being monitored due to his terrorist inclinations and anarchist background. Heat suspects Michaelis. Knowing that Michaelis has recently moved to the [[countryside]] to write a book, the Chief Inspector informs the [[Assistant Commissioner]] that he has a contact, Verloc, who may be able to assist in the case. The Assistant Commissioner shares some of the same high society acquaintances with Michaelis and is chiefly motivated by finding the extent of Michaelis's involvement in order to assess any possible embarrassment to his connections. He later speaks to his superior, Sir Ethelred, about his intentions to solve the case alone, rather than rely on the effort of Chief Inspector Heat.\n\nThe novel flashes back to before the explosion, taking the perspective of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Mrs Verloc's mother informs the family that she intends to move out of the house. Mrs Verloc's mother and Stevie use a [[hansom]] driven by a man with a hook for a hand. The driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs Verloc must calm him. On Verloc's return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to go for a walk with Stevie. After this walk, Mrs Verloc notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.\n\nAs Verloc is talking to his wife about the possibility of emigrating to the continent, he is paid a visit by the Assistant Commissioner. Shortly thereafter, Chief Inspector Heat arrives to speak with Verloc, without knowing that the Assistant Commissioner had left with Verloc earlier that evening.  The Chief Inspector tells Mrs Verloc that he had recovered an overcoat at the scene of the bombing which had the shop's address written on a label.  Mrs Verloc confirms that it was Stevie's overcoat, and that she had written the address. On Verloc's return, he realises that his wife knows that his bomb killed her brother, and confesses what truly happened. A stunned Mrs Verloc, in her anguish, fatally stabs her husband.\n\nAfter the murder, Mrs Verloc flees her home, where she chances upon Comrade Ossipon, and begs him to help her. Ossipon assists her while confessing romantic feelings but secretly with a view to possess Mr Verloc's bank account savings.  They plan to run away and he aids her in taking a boat to the continent. However, her instability and the revelation of Verloc's murder increasingly worry him, and he abandons her, taking Mr Verloc's savings with him. He later discovers in a newspaper that a woman matching Mrs Verloc's description disappeared from the ferry, leaving behind her wedding ring before drowning herself in the English Channel.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Adolf Verloc''': a secret agent who owns a shop in [[Soho]] in London. His primary characteristic, as described by Conrad, is indolence. He has been employed by an unnamed embassy to spy on revolutionary groups, which then orders him to instigate a terrorist act against the [[Greenwich Observatory]]. Their belief is that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to act more forcibly against \u00e9migr\u00e9 socialist and anarchist activists. He is part of an anarchist organisation that creates pamphlets under the heading ''The Future of the Proletariat''. He is married to Winnie, and lives with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie.\n* '''Winnie Verloc''': Verloc's wife.  She cares deeply for her brother Stevie, who has the mental age of a young child. Of working class origins, her father was the owner of a [[pub]]. She is younger than her husband and married him not for love but to provide a home for her mother and brother.  A loyal wife, she is disturbed upon learning of the death of her brother due to her husband's plotting, and kills him with a knife in the heart. She dies, presumably by drowning herself to avoid the gallows.\n* '''Stevie''': Winnie's brother has the mental age of a young child. He is sensitive and is disturbed by notions of violence or hardship. His sister cares for him, and Stevie passes most of his time drawing numerous circles on pieces of paper. Verloc, exploiting both Stevie's childlike simplicity and his outrage at suffering, employs him to carry out the bombing of Greenwich Observatory. Stevie stumbles and the bomb explodes prematurely.\n* '''Mrs Verloc's mother''': Old and infirm, Mrs Verloc's mother leaves the household to live in an [[almshouse]], believing that two disabled people (herself and Stevie) are too much for Mr Verloc's generosity. The widow of a publican, she spent most of her life working hard in her husband's pub and believes Mr Verloc to be a gentleman because she thinks he resembles patrons of business houses (pubs with higher prices, consequently frequented by the upper classes).\n* '''Chief Inspector Heat''': a policeman who is dealing with the explosion at [[Greenwich]]. An astute, practical man who uses a clue found at the scene of the crime to trace events back to Verloc's home. Although he informs his superior what he is planning to do with regards to the case, he is initially not aware that the Assistant Commissioner is acting without his knowledge. Heat knew Verloc before the bombing as Verloc had supplied information to Heat through the Embassy. Heat despises anarchists, whom he regards as amateurs, as opposed to burglars, whom he regards as professionals.\n* The '''Assistant Commissioner''': of [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|a higher rank]] than the Chief Inspector, he uses the knowledge gained from Heat to pursue matters personally, for reasons of his own. The Assistant Commissioner is married to a lady with influential connections. He informs his superior, Sir Ethelred, of his intentions, and tracks down Verloc before Heat can.\n* '''Sir Ethelred''': a secretary of state ([[Home Secretary]]), to whom the Assistant Commissioner reports. At the time of the bombing he is busy trying to pass a bill regarding the nationalisation of fisheries through the House of Commons against strong opposition. He is briefed by the Assistant Commissioner throughout the novel and often admonishes him not to go into detail.\n* '''Mr Vladimir''': First Secretary of the embassy of an unnamed country. Though his name might suggest that this is the Russian embassy, the name of the previous first secretary, Baron Stott-Wartenheim, is Germanic, as is that of Privy Councillor Wurmt, another official of this embassy. This is not surprising given the disproportionate number of Germans in the Russian state during the Czarist period. There is also the suggestion that Vladimir is not from Europe but Central Asia.{{Sfn | Conrad | 1969 | pp = 29, 38}}  Vladimir thinks that the 'English' police are far too soft on \u00e9migr\u00e9 socialists and anarchists, who are a real problem in his home country. He orders Verloc to instigate a terrorist act, hoping that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to adopt repressive measures.\n*'''Michaelis''': a member of Verloc's group, and another anarchist. The most philosophical member of the group, his theories resemble those of [[Peter Kropotkin]] while some of his other attributes resemble [[Mikhail Bakunin]].\n* '''Comrade Alexander Ossipon''': an ex-medical student, anarchist and member of Verloc's group. He survives on the savings of women he seduces, mostly working-class women. He is influenced by the theories on degeneracy of [[Cesare Lombroso]]. After Verloc's murder he initially helps, but afterwards abandons Winnie, leaving her penniless on a train. He is later disturbed when he reads of her suicide and wonders if he will be able to seduce a woman again.\n*'''Karl Yundt''': a member of Verloc's group, commonly referred to as an \"old terrorist\".\n*'''The Professor''': another anarchist, who specialises in explosives. The Professor carries a flask of explosives in his coat, which can be detonated within twenty seconds of him squeezing an indiarubber ball in his pocket. The police know this and keep their distance. The most nihilistic member of the anarchists, the Professor feels oppressed and disgusted by the rest of humanity and has particular contempt for the weak. He dreams of a world where the weak are freely exterminated so that the strong can thrive. He supplies to Verloc the bomb that kills Stevie. (The Professor also appears as a character in Conrad's short story, ''The Informer''.) The person who supplied the Greenwich bomb was a Scottish medical doctor and leading anarchist Dr [[Thomas Fauset McDonald]]. McDonald is Dr Armitage in Olivia and [[Helen Rossetti]]\u2019s [[Roman \u00e0 clef]], [[A Girl among the anarchists]](1903).\n\n==Background: Greenwich Bombing of 1894==\n[[File:Royal Greenwich Observatory Postcard c1902.jpg|275 px|thumb|right|[[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] c. 1902 as depicted on a postcard]]\nConrad's character Stevie is based on the French anarchist [[Martial Bourdin]] who died gruesomely in [[Greenwich Park]] when the explosives he carried detonated prematurely.<ref>{{Citation | last = Mulry | first = David | title = Popular Accounts of the Greenwich Bombing and Conrad's 'The Secret Agent' | journal = Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | year = 2000 | pages = 43\u201364}}.</ref> Bourdin's motives remain a mystery as does his intended target, which may have been the [[Greenwich Observatory]].<ref>{{cite web|date=15 August 2005 |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.413 |publisher=NMM |title=Propaganda by Deed \u2013 the Greenwich Observatory Bomb of 1894 |place=Greenwich, [[England|ENG]], UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035329/https://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.413 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In the 1920 Author's Note to the novel, Conrad recalls a discussion with [[Ford Madox Ford]] about the bombing:<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Karl | editor-first = Frederick R | contribution = Introduction | title = The Secret Agent | publisher = Signet | year = 1983 | pages = 5\u20136}}</ref>\n{{Quotation | [...] we recalled the already old story of the attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory; a blood-stained inanity of so fatuous a kind that it was impossible to fathom its origin by any reasonable or even unreasonable process of thought. For perverse unreason has its own logical processes. But that outrage could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way, so that one remained faced by the fact of a man blown to bits for nothing even most remotely resembling an idea, anarchistic or other. As to the outer wall of the Observatory it did not show as much as the faintest crack. I pointed all this out to my friend, who remained silent for a while and then remarked in his characteristically casual and omniscient manner: \"Oh, that fellow was half an idiot. His sister committed suicide afterwards.\" These were absolutely the only words that passed between us [...].<ref>{{cite web | year = 1920 | publisher = Read print | url = http://www.readprint.com/chapter-2017/Joseph-Conrad | last = Conrad | first = Joseph | title = The Secret Agent: a Simple Tale | others = Author's note.}}</ref>}}\n\n==Major themes==\n===Terrorism and anarchism===\nTerrorism and anarchism are intrinsic aspects of the novel, and are central to the plot. Verloc is employed by an agency which requires him to orchestrate terrorist activities, and several of the characters deal with terrorism in some way: Verloc's friends are all interested in an anarchistic political revolution, and the police are investigating anarchist motives behind the bombing of Greenwich.\n\nThe novel was written at a time when terrorist activity was increasing. There had been numerous dynamite attacks in both Europe and the US, as well as several assassinations of heads of state.{{Sfn|Houen|2002|p = 14}} Conrad also drew upon two persons specifically: [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Conrad used these two men in his \"portrayal of the novel's anarchists\".{{Sfn|Conrad|2004|p = xix}}  However, according to Conrad's Author's Note, only one character was a true anarchist: Winnie Verloc. In ''The Secret Agent'', she is \"the only character who performs a serious act of violence against another\",{{Sfn|Houen|2002|p = 54}} despite the ''F.P.'''s intentions of radical change, and The Professor's inclination to keep a bomb on his person.\n\nCritics have analysed the role of terrorism in the novel. [[Patrick Reilly]] calls the novel \"a terrorist text as well as a text about terrorism\"{{Sfn | Reilly | 2003 | p = 53}} due to Conrad's manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.{{Sfn | Paulson | 2007 | p = 328}}\n\n===Politics===\nThe role of politics is paramount in the novel, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The role of politics is seen in several places in the novel: in the revolutionary ideas of the ''F.P.''; in the characters' personal beliefs; and in Verloc's own private life. Conrad's depiction of [[anarchism]] has an \"enduring political relevance\", although the focus is now largely concerned with the terrorist aspects that this entails.<ref name=\"Enduring\">{{Citation | first = David | last = Mulry | title = The Anarchist in the House: The Politics of Conrad's ''The Secret Agent''}} in {{Harvnb | Simmons | Stape | 2007 | p = 2}}.</ref> The discussions of the ''F.P.'' are expositions on the role of anarchism and its relation to contemporary life. The threat of these thoughts is evident, as Chief Inspector Heat knows ''F.P.'' members because of their anarchist views. Moreover, Michaelis' actions are monitored by the police to such an extent that he must notify the police station that he is moving to the country.\n\nThe plot to destroy Greenwich is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing \"must be purely destructive\" and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion \"should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.\"<ref name= \"anarchist\">{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Conrad | year = 1993 | title = The Secret Agent | place = London | publisher = Penguin | page = 35}}.</ref> However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency.\n\nSome critics, such as Fredrick R Karl,<ref>{{cite book|last=Conrad|first=Joseph|year=1983|title=The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnH2Sz5rY0IC&pg=RA1-PA4-IA1&lpg=PA5|contribution=Introduction|publisher=Signet|pages=5\u201321|format=Google Books|accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> think that the main political phenomenon in this novel is the modern age, as symbolised by the teeming, pullulating foggy streets of London (most notably in the cab ride taken by Winnie Verloc and Stevie).  This modern age distorts everything, including politics (Verloc is motivated by the need to keep his remunerative position, the Professor to some extent by pride); the family (symbolised by the Verloc household, in which all roles are distorted, with the husband being like a father to the wife, who is like a mother to her brother); even the human body (Michaelis and Verloc are hugely obese, while the Professor and Yundt are preternaturally thin). This extended metaphor, using London as a centre of darkness much like Kurtz's headquarters in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1Ty1dv-9AIC&pg=PA176&dq=conrad+%22the+secret+agent%22&as_brr=3|title=Joseph Conrad: Third World Perspectives|first=R|last=Hamner|publisher=Lynne Rienner|year=1990|page=176|format=Google Books|accessdate=18March 2012}}</ref> presents \"a dark vision of moral and spiritual inertia\" and a condemnation of those who, like Mrs Verloc, think it a mistake to think too deeply.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XuDU4l9vg_IC&pg=PA5&dq=conrad+%22the+secret+agent%22&as_brr=3|title=Joseph Conrad: his moral vision|first=George Andrew|last=Panichas|page=5|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=2005|format=Google Books|accessdate=18 March 2012|ISBN=978-0-86554-936-4}}</ref>\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nInitially, the novel fared poorly in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling only 3,076 copies between 1907 and 1914. The book fared slightly better in Britain, yet no more than 6,500 copies were printed before 1914. Although sales increased after 1914, it never sold more than modestly during Conrad's life. It was published to favourable reviews, most agreeing with the view of ''The Times Literary Supplement'' that it \"increase[d] Conrad's reputation, already of the highest\".{{Sfn | Orr | Billy | Billy | 1999 | pp = 167\u201368}}  However, there were detractors who criticised the novel's \"unpleasant characters and subject\".

''The Secret Agent'' is one of Conrad's later political novels in which he moved away from his former tales of [[Seamanship|seafaring]]. The novel is dedicated to [[H. G. Wells]] and deals broadly with [[anarchism]], [[espionage]] and [[terrorism]].{{Sfn | Conrad | 2004 | p = xiv}} It also deals with exploitation of the vulnerable in Verloc's relationship with his brother-in-law Stevie, who has a [[intellectual disability|learning difficulty]].

Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives and [[bric-a-brac]]. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possibly [[autism]],<ref>{{citation | issue = 4 | title = Autism in literature | first = G Patrick | last = Farrell | date =     1 December 1985 | DOI = 10.1007/BF01531790 | ISSN = 1573-3432 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 15 | page = 441 | publisher = Springer }}</ref> which causes him to be excitable; his sister, Verloc's wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc's friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and \"The Professor\" are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produces anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitled ''F.P.'', an acronym for ''The Future of the Proletariat''.\n\nThe novel begins in Verloc's home, as he and his wife discuss the trivialities of everyday life, which introduces the reader to Verloc's family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country.  Although a member of an anarchist cell, Verloc is also secretly employed by the Embassy as an [[agent provocateur]]. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation \u2013 the destruction of [[Greenwich Observatory]] by a bomb. Vladimir explains that Britain's lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and he reasons that an attack on 'science', the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of a communist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc's brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.\n\nThe novel flashes forward to after the bombing has taken place. Comrade Ossipon meets The Professor, who discusses having given explosives to Verloc. The Professor describes the nature of the bomb he carries in his coat at all times: it allows him to press a button which will kill him and those nearest to him in twenty seconds.  After The Professor leaves the meeting, he stumbles into [[Chief Inspector]] Heat, a policeman investigating a recent explosion at Greenwich, where one man was killed.  Heat informs The Professor that he is not a suspect in the case, but that he is being monitored due to his terrorist inclinations and anarchist background. Heat suspects Michaelis. Knowing that Michaelis has recently moved to the [[countryside]] to write a book, the Chief Inspector informs the [[Assistant Commissioner]] that he has a contact, Verloc, who may be able to assist in the case. The Assistant Commissioner shares some of the same high society acquaintances with Michaelis and is chiefly motivated by finding the extent of Michaelis's involvement in order to assess any possible embarrassment to his connections. He later speaks to his superior, Sir Ethelred, about his intentions to solve the case alone, rather than rely on the effort of Chief Inspector Heat.\n\nThe novel flashes back to before the explosion, taking the perspective of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Mrs Verloc's mother informs the family that she intends to move out of the house. Mrs Verloc's mother and Stevie use a [[hansom]] driven by a man with a hook for a hand. The driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs Verloc must calm him. On Verloc's return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to go for a walk with Stevie. After this walk, Mrs Verloc notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.\n\nAs Verloc is talking to his wife about the possibility of emigrating to the continent, he is paid a visit by the Assistant Commissioner. Shortly thereafter, Chief Inspector Heat arrives to speak with Verloc, without knowing that the Assistant Commissioner had left with Verloc earlier that evening.  The Chief Inspector tells Mrs Verloc that he had recovered an overcoat at the scene of the bombing which had the shop's address written on a label.  Mrs Verloc confirms that it was Stevie's overcoat, and that she had written the address. On Verloc's return, he realises that his wife knows that his bomb killed her brother, and confesses what truly happened. A stunned Mrs Verloc, in her anguish, fatally stabs her husband.\n\nAfter the murder, Mrs Verloc flees her home, where she chances upon Comrade Ossipon, and begs him to help her. Ossipon assists her while confessing romantic feelings but secretly with a view to possess Mr Verloc's bank account savings.  They plan to run away and he aids her in taking a boat to the continent. However, her instability and the revelation of Verloc's murder increasingly worry him, and he abandons her, taking Mr Verloc's savings with him. He later discovers in a newspaper that a woman matching Mrs Verloc's description disappeared from the ferry, leaving behind her wedding ring before drowning herself in the English Channel.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Adolf Verloc''': a secret agent who owns a shop in [[Soho]] in London. His primary characteristic, as described by Conrad, is indolence. He has been employed by an unnamed embassy to spy on revolutionary groups, which then orders him to instigate a terrorist act against the [[Greenwich Observatory]]. Their belief is that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to act more forcibly against \u00e9migr\u00e9 socialist and anarchist activists. He is part of an anarchist organisation that creates pamphlets under the heading ''The Future of the Proletariat''. He is married to Winnie, and lives with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie.\n* '''Winnie Verloc''': Verloc's wife.  She cares deeply for her brother Stevie, who has the mental age of a young child. Of working class origins, her father was the owner of a [[pub]]. She is younger than her husband and married him not for love but to provide a home for her mother and brother.  A loyal wife, she is disturbed upon learning of the death of her brother due to her husband's plotting, and kills him with a knife in the heart. She dies, presumably by drowning herself to avoid the gallows.\n* '''Stevie''': Winnie's brother has the mental age of a young child. He is sensitive and is disturbed by notions of violence or hardship. His sister cares for him, and Stevie passes most of his time drawing numerous circles on pieces of paper. Verloc, exploiting both Stevie's childlike simplicity and his outrage at suffering, employs him to carry out the bombing of Greenwich Observatory. Stevie stumbles and the bomb explodes prematurely.\n* '''Mrs Verloc's mother''': Old and infirm, Mrs Verloc's mother leaves the household to live in an [[almshouse]], believing that two disabled people (herself and Stevie) are too much for Mr Verloc's generosity. The widow of a publican, she spent most of her life working hard in her husband's pub and believes Mr Verloc to be a gentleman because she thinks he resembles patrons of business houses (pubs with higher prices, consequently frequented by the upper classes).\n* '''Chief Inspector Heat''': a policeman who is dealing with the explosion at [[Greenwich]]. An astute, practical man who uses a clue found at the scene of the crime to trace events back to Verloc's home. Although he informs his superior what he is planning to do with regards to the case, he is initially not aware that the Assistant Commissioner is acting without his knowledge. Heat knew Verloc before the bombing as Verloc had supplied information to Heat through the Embassy. Heat despises anarchists, whom he regards as amateurs, as opposed to burglars, whom he regards as professionals.\n* The '''Assistant Commissioner''': of [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|a higher rank]] than the Chief Inspector, he uses the knowledge gained from Heat to pursue matters personally, for reasons of his own. The Assistant Commissioner is married to a lady with influential connections. He informs his superior, Sir Ethelred, of his intentions, and tracks down Verloc before Heat can.\n* '''Sir Ethelred''': a secretary of state ([[Home Secretary]]), to whom the Assistant Commissioner reports. At the time of the bombing he is busy trying to pass a bill regarding the nationalisation of fisheries through the House of Commons against strong opposition. He is briefed by the Assistant Commissioner throughout the novel and often admonishes him not to go into detail.\n* '''Mr Vladimir''': First Secretary of the embassy of an unnamed country. Though his name might suggest that this is the Russian embassy, the name of the previous first secretary, Baron Stott-Wartenheim, is Germanic, as is that of Privy Councillor Wurmt, another official of this embassy. This is not surprising given the disproportionate number of Germans in the Russian state during the Czarist period. There is also the suggestion that Vladimir is not from Europe but Central Asia.{{Sfn | Conrad | 1969 | pp = 29, 38}}  Vladimir thinks that the 'English' police are far too soft on \u00e9migr\u00e9 socialists and anarchists, who are a real problem in his home country. He orders Verloc to instigate a terrorist act, hoping that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to adopt repressive measures.\n*'''Michaelis''': a member of Verloc's group, and another anarchist. The most philosophical member of the group, his theories resemble those of [[Peter Kropotkin]] while some of his other attributes resemble [[Mikhail Bakunin]].\n* '''Comrade Alexander Ossipon''': an ex-medical student, anarchist and member of Verloc's group. He survives on the savings of women he seduces, mostly working-class women. He is influenced by the theories on degeneracy of [[Cesare Lombroso]]. After Verloc's murder he initially helps, but afterwards abandons Winnie, leaving her penniless on a train. He is later disturbed when he reads of her suicide and wonders if he will be able to seduce a woman again.\n*'''Karl Yundt''': a member of Verloc's group, commonly referred to as an \"old terrorist\".\n*'''The Professor''': another anarchist, who specialises in explosives. The Professor carries a flask of explosives in his coat, which can be detonated within twenty seconds of him squeezing an indiarubber ball in his pocket. The police know this and keep their distance. The most nihilistic member of the anarchists, the Professor feels oppressed and disgusted by the rest of humanity and has particular contempt for the weak. He dreams of a world where the weak are freely exterminated so that the strong can thrive. He supplies to Verloc the bomb that kills Stevie. (The Professor also appears as a character in Conrad's short story, ''The Informer''.) The person who supplied the Greenwich bomb was a Scottish medical doctor and leading anarchist Dr [[Thomas Fauset McDonald]]. McDonald is Dr Armitage in Olivia and [[Helen Rossetti]]\u2019s [[Roman \u00e0 clef]], [[A Girl among the anarchists]](1903).\n\n==Background: Greenwich Bombing of 1894==\n[[File:Royal Greenwich Observatory Postcard c1902.jpg|275 px|thumb|right|[[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] c. 1902 as depicted on a postcard]]\nConrad's character Stevie is based on the French anarchist [[Martial Bourdin]] who died gruesomely in [[Greenwich Park]] when the explosives he carried detonated prematurely.<ref>{{Citation | last = Mulry | first = David | title = Popular Accounts of the Greenwich Bombing and Conrad's 'The Secret Agent' | journal = Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | year = 2000 | pages = 43\u201364}}.</ref> Bourdin's motives remain a mystery as does his intended target, which may have been the [[Greenwich Observatory]].<ref>{{cite web|date=15 August 2005 |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.413 |publisher=NMM |title=Propaganda by Deed \u2013 the Greenwich Observatory Bomb of 1894 |place=Greenwich, [[England|ENG]], UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035329/https://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.413 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In the 1920 Author's Note to the novel, Conrad recalls a discussion with [[Ford Madox Ford]] about the bombing:<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Karl | editor-first = Frederick R | contribution = Introduction | title = The Secret Agent | publisher = Signet | year = 1983 | pages = 5\u20136}}</ref>\n{{Quotation | [...] we recalled the already old story of the attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory; a blood-stained inanity of so fatuous a kind that it was impossible to fathom its origin by any reasonable or even unreasonable process of thought. For perverse unreason has its own logical processes. But that outrage could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way, so that one remained faced by the fact of a man blown to bits for nothing even most remotely resembling an idea, anarchistic or other. As to the outer wall of the Observatory it did not show as much as the faintest crack. I pointed all this out to my friend, who remained silent for a while and then remarked in his characteristically casual and omniscient manner: \"Oh, that fellow was half an idiot. His sister committed suicide afterwards.\" These were absolutely the only words that passed between us [...].<ref>{{cite web | year = 1920 | publisher = Read print | url = http://www.readprint.com/chapter-2017/Joseph-Conrad | last = Conrad | first = Joseph | title = The Secret Agent: a Simple Tale | others = Author's note.}}</ref>}}\n\n==Major themes==\n===Terrorism and anarchism===\nTerrorism and anarchism are intrinsic aspects of the novel, and are central to the plot. Verloc is employed by an agency which requires him to orchestrate terrorist activities, and several of the characters deal with terrorism in some way: Verloc's friends are all interested in an anarchistic political revolution, and the police are investigating anarchist motives behind the bombing of Greenwich.\n\nThe novel was written at a time when terrorist activity was increasing. There had been numerous dynamite attacks in both Europe and the US, as well as several assassinations of heads of state.{{Sfn|Houen|2002|p = 14}} Conrad also drew upon two persons specifically: [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Conrad used these two men in his \"portrayal of the novel's anarchists\".{{Sfn|Conrad|2004|p = xix}}  However, according to Conrad's Author's Note, only one character was a true anarchist: Winnie Verloc. In ''The Secret Agent'', she is \"the only character who performs a serious act of violence against another\",{{Sfn|Houen|2002|p = 54}} despite the ''F.P.'''s intentions of radical change, and The Professor's inclination to keep a bomb on his person.\n\nCritics have analysed the role of terrorism in the novel. [[Patrick Reilly]] calls the novel \"a terrorist text as well as a text about terrorism\"{{Sfn | Reilly | 2003 | p = 53}} due to Conrad's manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.{{Sfn | Paulson | 2007 | p = 328}}\n\n===Politics===\nThe role of politics is paramount in the novel, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The role of politics is seen in several places in the novel: in the revolutionary ideas of the ''F.P.''; in the characters' personal beliefs; and in Verloc's own private life. Conrad's depiction of [[anarchism]] has an \"enduring political relevance\", although the focus is now largely concerned with the terrorist aspects that this entails.<ref name=\"Enduring\">{{Citation | first = David | last = Mulry | title = The Anarchist in the House: The Politics of Conrad's ''The Secret Agent''}} in {{Harvnb | Simmons | Stape | 2007 | p = 2}}.</ref> The discussions of the ''F.P.'' are expositions on the role of anarchism and its relation to contemporary life. The threat of these thoughts is evident, as Chief Inspector Heat knows ''F.P.'' members because of their anarchist views. Moreover, Michaelis' actions are monitored by the police to such an extent that he must notify the police station that he is moving to the country.\n\nThe plot to destroy Greenwich is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing \"must be purely destructive\" and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion \"should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.\"<ref name= \"anarchist\">{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Conrad | year = 1993 | title = The Secret Agent | place = London | publisher = Penguin | page = 35}}.</ref> However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency.\n\nSome critics, such as Fredrick R Karl,<ref>{{cite book|last=Conrad|first=Joseph|year=1983|title=The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnH2Sz5rY0IC&pg=RA1-PA4-IA1&lpg=PA5|contribution=Introduction|publisher=Signet|pages=5\u201321|format=Google Books|accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> think that the main political phenomenon in this novel is the modern age, as symbolised by the teeming, pullulating foggy streets of London (most notably in the cab ride taken by Winnie Verloc and Stevie).  This modern age distorts everything, including politics (Verloc is motivated by the need to keep his remunerative position, the Professor to some extent by pride); the family (symbolised by the Verloc household, in which all roles are distorted, with the husband being like a father to the wife, who is like a mother to her brother); even the human body (Michaelis and Verloc are hugely obese, while the Professor and Yundt are preternaturally thin).

The book fared slightly better in Britain, yet no more than 6,500 copies were printed before 1914. Although sales increased after 1914, it never sold more than modestly during Conrad's life. It was published to favourable reviews, most agreeing with the view of ''The Times Literary Supplement'' that it \"increase[d] Conrad's reputation, already of the highest\".{{Sfn | Orr | Billy | Billy | 1999 | pp = 167\u201368}}  However, there were detractors who criticised the novel's \"unpleasant characters and subject\". ''Country Life'' magazine called the story \"indecent\" and criticised Conrad's \"often dense and elliptical style\".{{Sfn | Orr | Billy | Billy | 1999 | pp = 167\u201368}}\n\n''The Secret Agent'' has come to be considered one of Conrad's finest novels.

[[Henri Frenay]], leader of Combat, claimed command of the new structure, but faced opposition from [[Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie]], leader of Liberation-Sud and [[:fr:Jean-Pierre L\u00e9vy (r\u00e9sistant)|Jean-Pierre Levy]], head of the Franc-Tireurs. [[Jean Moulin]] insisted that the post should go to someone who with no affiliation to one of these groups, so Frenay proposed [[Charles Delestraint]], a general recalled from his retirement during the [[Battle of France]], who admired De Gaulle and detested Vichy. He was the only general officer who had been promoted despite that defeat; the proposal was unanimously accepted.\n\nJean Moulin and General Delestraint first met on August 28, 1942 in Lyon. At the end of the interview, Jean Moulin ordered the three regional chiefs of the paramilitary formations of the great movements made available to Delestraint, for him to choose the best suited to the regional direction of the Secret Army. To this position, eminently clandestine and dangerous, the general named Captain {{ILL|Claudius Billon|fr}}. As early as September, Billon appointed each of the AS departmental heads for R1, with the exception of the AS chief for [[Ain]], named by Delestraint himself.\n\nIn October, Delestraint was appointed (officially) by [[General de Gaulle]]. [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre]] had also been approached for this post, but had refused. Delestraint took command on November 11, 1942. His secretary was {{ILL|Francois-Yves Guillin|fr}}; the head of the 2nd AS office was {{ILL|Joseph Gastaldo|fr}}. [[Andr\u00e9 Lassagne]] was the deputy of Gastaldo, before becoming Delestraint, and the information was entrusted to Albert Lacaze (4th office). Its chief of staff was {{ILL|Fran\u00e7ois Morin-Forestier|fr}}, from Combat, staff in which is also integrated [[Raymond Aubrac]].{{what|date=May 2019}}\n \nOn November 27, 1942 in [[Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or]], the constituent meeting of the Southern Zone Coordination Committee was held and the head of the Secret Army was presented by Jean Moulin. This committee intended to unite the three major resistance movements.\n\nIn December, Delestraint, inexperienced in the constraints of illegal life, crossed the demarcation line to make contact with the major movements in the northern zone: Liberation, the Civil and Military Organization (CMO) National, Lib\u00e9ration-Nord. Then, back in the free zone, he took part in the creation of the United Movements of the Resistance (MUR) on January 26, 1943 in Miribel, in Ain.\n\nAt the beginning of February 1943, {{ILL|Hugo Geissler|fr}}, Kommandeur of the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]]-[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] in Vichy, decapitated the Secret Army of the R1 region. On February 1 in Lyon's Place du Pont, he arrested Billon, head of the AS in R1 (eleven departments), along with his deputy Pierre Lavergne. On February 3, at 31, rue Basse-des-Rives in Saint-\u00c9tienne, during a secret meeting of the headquarters of the departmental AS, he also arrested the head of AS Loire, Lieutenant Vidiani, and his companions. On February 10, in [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], they continued to dismantle the AS in R1 with the arrest of the chief of AS in Haute-Loire Alfred Salvatelli and his companions at his home. After the February 10 arrest, the Haute-Loire resistance joined region R6 (Auvergne). On 27 May 1943, these three arrests, orchestrated by Geissler, featured prominently at the beginning of the [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]]'s report addressed to [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Reich.\n\nDelestraint then fought against the advice of Frenay (who had been provisionally delegated general of the Secret Army) to put the Army under the tutelage of the MUR. Frenay, on the one hand the No. 2 of the Secret Army and on the other a member of the Coordination Committee of the same army, then wished the recall of Delestraint and his own appointment as head of the Secret Army, which were rejected by the other members of the Coordinating Committee, Moulin, d'Astier and Levy.\n\nIn London in February 1943 to meet Allied authorities, Delestraint was asked to make his troop the \"nucleus of the future French army\", estimated at 150,000 men. Unfortunately, Francois Morin-Forestier was arrested in March with Raymond Aubrac, [[Maurice Kriegel-Vallimont]] and {{ILL|Serge Ravanel|fr}} of the MUR, and only  released in May, thanks to the action of his former co-detainee Raymond Aubrac. His release did not allow his return to the staff: too exposed, he was ex-filtered to London. In April, Delestraint returned to Paris, arriving April 11. By the June 4 report, Moulin deplores the risks that Delestraint was taking, working alone when he would do better if assisted.\n\nOn June 9, 1943, Delestraint, Gastaldo and their deputy Jean-Louis Th\u00e9obald were arrested in Paris. On June 21, a staff meeting was held to find a successor to Delestraint in [[Caluire-et-Cuire]]. L\u00e9onard \u00c9mile Schwarzfeld, candidate to replace Delestraint, Aubrac, candidate for the leadership in the northern zone, and Lassagne for the southern zone, as well as other leaders of the Resistance such as Moulin, [[Henri Aubry]], [[Ren\u00e9 Hardy]], {{ILL|Albert Lacaze|fr}} and {{ILL|Bruno Larat|fr}} were taken prisoner. In July 1943, Colonel [[Pierre Dejussieu-Pontcarral]] was appointed chief of staff of a Secret Army now without an official leader. The Chief of Staff of the Southern Zone was General Jouffrault, until he was also arrested in August 1943.\n\nOn February 1, 1944, the Gaullist Secret Army merged with the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), with the Army Resistance Organization (ORA) and the French Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTPF, communists, not to be confused with the Franc-Tireur movement).\n\nThis structure was mainly found in the southern half of France: [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] (R1) and [[Auvergne]] (R6), but also [[Limousin]] (R5), South-East and the Southwest (R4). It corresponded to the organizational structure used by Combat.\n\nUniting the regions of the free zone took only a few weeks, the various chiefs being chosen from among the regional chiefs in office. In Region A, the workforce was almost entirely composed of members of the CMO.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Regions==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text-align:center; width=80%;\"\n|+ Layout of Resistance forces\n!width=\"25%\" | Region || Departement || Leader || Others\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''B''' || '''Region''' || General [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Faucher]] ||\n|-\n| [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmond Proust|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''M''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Alexandre Audibert|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | '''M2''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Allard|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Finist\u00e8re]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathieu Donnart|fr}}<br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Bourri\u00e8res|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Morbihan]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Guillaudot|fr}}<br/>[[Paul Chenailler]] ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" | '''R1 - Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes''' || '''Region''' || Captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Claudius Billon|fr}}<br/><br/>Capt. {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Chambonnet|fr}}<br/>|| {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Lavergne|fr}} (Maquis)<br/><br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Vansteenberghe|fr}} (intelligence)\n|-\n| [[Ain (d\u00e9partement)|Ain]] || Andr\u00e9 ''Bob'' Fornier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maquisdelain.org/index.php?r=personnage&id=60 |language=French |title=Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura |trans-title=Maquis of the Ain and Haut-Jura |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref><br/>Capt.

The Chief of Staff of the Southern Zone was General Jouffrault, until he was also arrested in August 1943.\n\nOn February 1, 1944, the Gaullist Secret Army merged with the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), with the Army Resistance Organization (ORA) and the French Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTPF, communists, not to be confused with the Franc-Tireur movement).\n\nThis structure was mainly found in the southern half of France: [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] (R1) and [[Auvergne]] (R6), but also [[Limousin]] (R5), South-East and the Southwest (R4). It corresponded to the organizational structure used by Combat.\n\nUniting the regions of the free zone took only a few weeks, the various chiefs being chosen from among the regional chiefs in office. In Region A, the workforce was almost entirely composed of members of the CMO.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Regions==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text-align:center; width=80%;\"\n|+ Layout of Resistance forces\n!width=\"25%\" | Region || Departement || Leader || Others\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''B''' || '''Region''' || General [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Faucher]] ||\n|-\n| [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmond Proust|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''M''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Alexandre Audibert|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | '''M2''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Allard|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Finist\u00e8re]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathieu Donnart|fr}}<br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Bourri\u00e8res|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Morbihan]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Guillaudot|fr}}<br/>[[Paul Chenailler]] ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" | '''R1 - Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes''' || '''Region''' || Captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Claudius Billon|fr}}<br/><br/>Capt. {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Chambonnet|fr}}<br/>|| {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Lavergne|fr}} (Maquis)<br/><br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Vansteenberghe|fr}} (intelligence)\n|-\n| [[Ain (d\u00e9partement)|Ain]] || Andr\u00e9 ''Bob'' Fornier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maquisdelain.org/index.php?r=personnage&id=60 |language=French |title=Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura |trans-title=Maquis of the Ain and Haut-Jura |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref><br/>Capt.

NATO is a [[military alliance]] of twenty-eight [[Europe]]an and two [[North America]]n countries that constitutes a system of [[collective defense]]. The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which allows only for the invitation of \"other European States\", and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join have to meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialogue and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the [[North Atlantic Council]], NATO's governing body.\n\nAfter its formation in 1949 with [[North Atlantic Treaty#Founding members|twelve founding members]], NATO grew by including [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in 1952 and [[West Germany]] in 1955, and then later [[Spain]] in 1982. After the [[Cold War]] ended, and [[Germany reunited]] in 1990, there was a debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and the [[Czech Republic]] joined NATO, amid much debate within the organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession of seven [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries: [[Bulgaria]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]]. These nations were first invited to start talks of membership during the [[2002 Prague summit]], and joined NATO shortly before the [[2004 Istanbul summit]]. [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] joined on 1 April 2009, prior to the [[2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit]]. The most recent member states to be added to NATO are [[Montenegro]] on 5 June 2017 and [[North Macedonia]] on 27 March 2020.\n\nAs of 2020, NATO officially recognizes [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as an official candidate and two aspiring members: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and   [[Ukraine]]. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Serbia]] have open political debate on the topic of membership, while in countries like [[Ukraine]], support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Soviet Union]] has been a cause of [[NATO-Russia relations|increased tension]] between NATO countries and [[Russia]].\n\n==Past enlargements==\n{{See also|Member states of NATO}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen \u00fcber NATO-Beitritt.jpg|thumb|[[London and Paris Conferences|Negotiations in London and Paris]] in 1954 ended the [[Allied-occupied Germany|allied occupation]] of [[West Germany]] and allowed for its rearmament as a NATO member.|alt=Four men stand behind podiums with their country names of France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States, in front of a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower.]]\nNATO has added new members eight times since its founding in 1949 to include thirty members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. The [[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|early years of the Cold War]] saw a stark divide between Capitalist states, backed by United States, and [[Soviet Empire|Communist satellite states]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. This divide eased inclusion of [[Portugal under Salazar]] in NATO and encouraged the anti-Communist governments of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/why-turkey-nato-704333 |title= Why Is Turkey In NATO? |work= The International Business Times |first= Palash |last= Ghosh |date= 26 June 2012 |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] ended the allies\u2019 occupation of [[West Germany]], and were ratified in part on the condition that West Germany join NATO, which it did in 1955.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue2/english/history.html |title= Germany's accession to NATO: 50 years on |journal= NATO Review |date=Summer 2005 |first= Helga |last= Haftendorn |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}</ref> Though initially isolationist, [[Francoist Spain|Spain under Francisco Franco]] was staunchly anti-Communist, and bound by regular defence agreements with NATO countries.{{sfn|Magone|2009|p=439}} After [[Spanish transition to democracy|its transition to democracy]], [[Spain]] came under pressure to normalize its European relations, including joining NATO, which it did in 1982.

The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join [[NATO]], and outlines NATO's \"open door\" policy:\n{{quote|1=The Parties may by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of America. The Government of the United States of America will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=North Atlantic Treaty |year=1949}}</ref>}}\nThis article poses two general limits to non-member states. First, only European states are eligible for new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward that have to be attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance [[Greece]] blocked the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO for many years due to the [[Macedonia naming dispute|disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia]].

alliance.]]\n\n'''Enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' ('''NATO''') is the process of including new member states in [[NATO]]. NATO is a [[military alliance]] of twenty-eight [[Europe]]an and two [[North America]]n countries that constitutes a system of [[collective defense]]. The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which allows only for the invitation of \"other European States\", and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join have to meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialogue and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the [[North Atlantic Council]], NATO's governing body.\n\nAfter its formation in 1949 with [[North Atlantic Treaty#Founding members|twelve founding members]], NATO grew by including [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in 1952 and [[West Germany]] in 1955, and then later [[Spain]] in 1982. After the [[Cold War]] ended, and [[Germany reunited]] in 1990, there was a debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and the [[Czech Republic]] joined NATO, amid much debate within the organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession of seven [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries: [[Bulgaria]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]]. These nations were first invited to start talks of membership during the [[2002 Prague summit]], and joined NATO shortly before the [[2004 Istanbul summit]]. [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] joined on 1 April 2009, prior to the [[2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit]]. The most recent member states to be added to NATO are [[Montenegro]] on 5 June 2017 and [[North Macedonia]] on 27 March 2020.\n\nAs of 2020, NATO officially recognizes [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as an official candidate and two aspiring members: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and   [[Ukraine]]. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Serbia]] have open political debate on the topic of membership, while in countries like [[Ukraine]], support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Soviet Union]] has been a cause of [[NATO-Russia relations|increased tension]] between NATO countries and [[Russia]].\n\n==Past enlargements==\n{{See also|Member states of NATO}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen \u00fcber NATO-Beitritt.jpg|thumb|[[London and Paris Conferences|Negotiations in London and Paris]] in 1954 ended the [[Allied-occupied Germany|allied occupation]] of [[West Germany]] and allowed for its rearmament as a NATO member.|alt=Four men stand behind podiums with their country names of France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States, in front of a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower.]]\nNATO has added new members seven times since its founding in 1949 to include twenty-nine members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. The [[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|early years of the Cold War]] saw a stark divide between Capitalist states, backed by United States, and [[Soviet Empire|Communist satellite states]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. This divide eased inclusion of [[Portugal under Salazar]] in NATO and encouraged the anti-Communist governments of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/why-turkey-nato-704333 |title= Why Is Turkey In NATO? |work= The International Business Times |first= Palash |last= Ghosh |date= 26 June 2012 |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] ended the allies\u2019 occupation of [[West Germany]], and were ratified in part on the condition that West Germany join NATO, which it did in 1955.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue2/english/history.html |title= Germany's accession to NATO: 50 years on |journal= NATO Review |date=Summer 2005 |first= Helga |last= Haftendorn |accessdate= 13 September 2014}}</ref> Though initially isolationist, [[Francoist Spain|Spain under Francisco Franco]] was staunchly anti-Communist, and bound by regular defence agreements with NATO countries.{{sfn|Magone|2009|p=439}} After [[Spanish transition to democracy|its transition to democracy]], [[Spain]] came under pressure to normalize its European relations, including joining NATO, which it did in 1982.

The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join [[NATO]], and outlines NATO's \"open door\" policy:\n{{quote|1=The Parties may by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of America. The Government of the United States of America will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=North Atlantic Treaty |year=1949}}</ref>}}\nThis article poses two general limits to non-member states. First, only European states are eligible for new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward that have to be attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance [[Greece]] blocked the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO for many years due to the [[Macedonia naming dispute|disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia]]. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] with NATO institutions as long as the [[Cyprus dispute]] is not resolved.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/node/14416843 |title= Fogh in the Aegean |date= 10 September 2009 |work= [[The Economist]] |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSince the [[1991 Rome summit]], when the delegations of its member states officially offered cooperation with Europe's newly democratic states, NATO has addressed and further defined the expectations and procedure for adding new members.

As such, the State of Israel not only has the right but also the obligation to do everything in its power to lessen the impact and scope of terrorism on the citizens of Israel. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003072906/http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/questions.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2013 }}</ref>\nThe Israeli government says that the barrier has been effective, as the number of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|suicide bombings]] carried out from the West Bank fell from 73 (between 2000 and July 2003 \u2013 the completion of the \"first continuous segment\"), to 12 (from August 2003 to the end of 2006).<ref name=\"IMFA1\">{{cite web|url=http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/web/main/missionhome.asp?MissionID=45187|title=The Anti-Terrorist Fence vs. Terrorism|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040110054951/http://securityfence.mfa.gov.il/mfm/web/main/missionhome.asp?MissionID=45187|archivedate=2004-01-10|accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref><ref name=\"McClatchy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/dion_nissenbaum/story/15469.html|title=Death toll of Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians hit a low in 2006|accessdate=2007-04-16|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion|date=January 10, 2007|work=Washington Bureau|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]]|quote=Fewer Israeli civilians died in Palestinian attacks in 2006 than in any year since the Palestinian uprising began in 2000. Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} network of high-tech fencing, concrete walls and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...] Opponents of the barrier grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line.

Eventually, it will encircle the town, but already, there is only one gate in and out of Qalquilya. Moving to and from the town is a draining process of waiting in the sunshine while papers are taken away and thought about. You can't take a car from one side to the other. When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi. ... Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the barrier threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.\u2026Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people \u2013 10 per cent of the population \u2013 have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind. ... Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes about 3.5 m shekels (\u00a3490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.'}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]] issued an advisory opinion stating that the barrier is a violation of international law.<ref>\"[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=11292 International Court of Justice finds Israeli barrier in Palestinian territory is illegal]\".

A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that \"they don't necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn't be\" (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating \"something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. [The elder man] wasn't speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower\" (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead \"of an aggressive prison Wall\" (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parry|first=William|title=Against the Wall the Art of Resistance in Palestine|publisher=Lawrence Hill|location=Chicago|page=192}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fnyulibrary-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D716232|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 2006, when he visited Israel to give a concert, [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]] wrote \"Tear down the wall\" on the wall, a phrase from the Pink Floyd album ''[[The Wall]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/pink-floyd-s-roger-waters-urges-israel-to-tear-down-the-wall-1.190942|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters urges Israel to 'tear down the wall'.

Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} network of high-tech fencing, concrete walls and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...] Opponents of the barrier grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line.

Eventually, it will encircle the town, but already, there is only one gate in and out of Qalquilya. Moving to and from the town is a draining process of waiting in the sunshine while papers are taken away and thought about. You can't take a car from one side to the other. When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi. ... Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the barrier threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.\u2026Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people \u2013 10 per cent of the population \u2013 have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind. ... Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes about 3.5 m shekels (\u00a3490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.'}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]] issued an advisory opinion stating that the barrier is a violation of international law.<ref>\"[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=11292 International Court of Justice finds Israeli barrier in Palestinian territory is illegal]\".

A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that \"they don't necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn't be\" (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating \"something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. [The elder man] wasn't speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower\" (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead \"of an aggressive prison Wall\" (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parry|first=William|title=Against the Wall the Art of Resistance in Palestine|publisher=Lawrence Hill|location=Chicago|page=192}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fnyulibrary-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D716232|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 2006, when he visited Israel to give a concert, [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]] wrote \"Tear down the wall\" on the wall, a phrase from the Pink Floyd album ''[[The Wall]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/pink-floyd-s-roger-waters-urges-israel-to-tear-down-the-wall-1.190942|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters urges Israel to 'tear down the wall'.
