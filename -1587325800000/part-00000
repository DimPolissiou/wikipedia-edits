[[Yoga]] in this form has become familiar across the world, especially [[Yoga in America|in America]] and Europe. It is derived from the postures used in the medieval spiritual discipline of [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]], but it is generally simply called \"yoga\"<!--exactly NOT the sense used in article [[yoga]], so do not wikilink-->. Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including '''modern postural yoga''',{{sfn|De Michelis|2004|pp=1-2}}{{efn|In 2004, [[Elizabeth De Michelis]] introduced a typology that subdivided her main category \"[[Modern Yoga]]\" into \"Modern Psychosomatic Yoga\", \"Modern Denominational Yoga\", \"Modern Postural Yoga\" and \"Modern Meditational Yoga\".<ref>The De Michelis 2004 typology can be seen at [https://docs.yuj.it/artefacts/yoga-as-linkage Yoga as Linkage].</ref>}} '''modern transnational yoga''',{{sfn|Brammer|2010|p=1}} and '''transnational anglophone yoga'''.{{sfn|Singleton|2013|p=38}}\n\nPostures were not central in any of the older traditions of [[yoga]]; posture practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]], who emphasised its health benefits. The flowing sequences of [[Salute to the Sun]] (Surya Namaskar) were pioneered by the Rajah of [[Aundh State|Aundh]], [[Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi]], in the 1920s.<ref name=\"ET 2018\">{{cite news |last1=Doctor |first1=Vikram |title=Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi: The man who promoted Surya Namaskar |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bhawanrao-shrinivasrao-pant-pratinidhi-the-man-who-promoted-surya-namaskar/articleshow/64607546.cms |work=The Economic Times (India) |date=15 June 2018}}</ref> It and many [[Standing asanas|standing poses]] used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by the yoga teacher [[Krishnamacharya]] in Mysore from the 1930s to the 1950s. Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga: [[Pattabhi Jois]] created [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]], which in turn led to [[Power Yoga]]; [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] created [[Iyengar Yoga]], and defined a modern set of yoga postures in his 1966 book ''[[Light on Yoga]]''; and [[Indra Devi]] taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood. Other major schools founded in the 20th century include [[Bikram Yoga]] and [[Sivananda Yoga]]. Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world.\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga's non-postural practices such as its [[Satkarma|purifications]] are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise. The term \"hatha yoga\" is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, sometimes [[Yoga for women|mainly for women]]. Practices vary from wholly secular, for exercise and relaxation, through to undoubtedly spiritual, whether in traditions like Sivananda Yoga or in personal rituals. Yoga as exercise's relationship to [[Hinduism]] is complex and contested; some Christians have rejected it on the grounds that it is covertly Hindu, while the \"Take Back Yoga\" campaign insisted that it was necessarily connected to Hinduism. Scholars have identified multiple trends in the changing nature of yoga since the end of the 19th century. Yoga as exercise has developed into a worldwide multi-billion dollar business, involving classes, [[Yoga teacher training|certification of teachers]], clothing such as [[yoga pants]], books, videos, equipment including [[yoga mat]]s, and holidays.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Prajnaparamita]] seated in [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] for [[meditation]], Java. 13th century]]\n\n===Yoga's origins===\n{{main|Yoga#History}}\n\nThe [[Sanskrit]] noun \u092f\u094b\u0917 ''{{IAST|yoga}}'', cognate with English \"[[yoke]]\", is derived from the root ''{{IAST|[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yewg-|yuj]]}}'' \"to attach, join, harness, yoke\".<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=David Gordon |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Yoga in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ii7D-bR0osC&pg=PA3 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-14086-5 |page=3}}</ref> Its ancient [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]].<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures is [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]].{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}}<ref name=\"Jain 2016\">{{cite web |last=Jain |first=Andrea |authorlink=Andrea Jain |title=The Early History of Modern Yoga |journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion |url=http://oxfordre.com/religion/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-163 |publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias |accessdate=23 February 2019 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.163 |date=July 2016}}</ref> The [[Sanskrit]] word \u0939\u0920 ''ha\u1e6dha'' means \"force\", alluding to its use of physical techniques.{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}}\n\n===Ha\u1e6dha yoga===\n{{main|Ha\u1e6dha yoga}}\n{{multiple image\n | image1            = Mode of action of Mudras.svg\n | width1            = 211\n | caption1          = Ha\u1e6dha yoga made use of [[Mudras]] to control vital forces in the [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=Chapters 5 and 6, especially pages 228\u2013229}}\n | image2            = Shatkarmas.svg\n | width2            = 160\n | caption2          = Ha\u1e6dha yoga used [[Satkarma]]s to purify the subtle body.{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=xxviii-xxxii, 46, 49-50, 71-79}}\n}}\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga flourished from c. 1100-c. 1900.{{sfn|Singleton|2010|pages=28\u201329}} It was practised in secret by solitary ascetic groups such as [[Nath]] yogins in South Asia.<!--India, Nepal, Tibet-->{{sfn|B\u00fchnemann|2007|pp=20-21}}<ref name=\"Mallinson 2011\">{{cite web |last1=Mallinson |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallinson (author) |title=A Response to Mark Singleton's Yoga Body by JamesMallinson |url=https://www.academia.edu/1146607 |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=9 December 2011}} revised from American Academy of Religions conference, San Francisco, 19 November 2011.</ref>{{sfn|Singleton|2010|p=173}} Instruction was directly from [[guru]] to [[shishya|individual pupil]], in a long-term relationship.{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|pp=27-29}} It was associated with religions, especially [[Hinduism]]{{sfn|B\u00fchnemann|2007|pp=20-21}} but also Jainism and Buddhism.

His many disciples include [[Swami Vishnudevananda]], who founded the International [[Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres]], starting in 1959; [[Satyananda Saraswati|Swami Satyananda]] of the [[Bihar School of Yoga]], a major centre of Ha\u1e6dha yoga teacher training, founded in 1963;{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=779}}{{sfn|Singleton|2010|p=213, note 14}} and [[Swami Satchidananda]] of [[Integral Yoga]], founded in 1966.{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=779}}\n\nVishnudevananda published his ''[[Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga]]'' in 1960,{{sfn|Vishnudevananda|1988}} with a list of asanas that substantially overlaps with Iyengar's, sometimes with different names for the same poses;{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|pp=87\u201389}}{{efn|The different names are sometimes closely connected. For example, [[Vishnudevananda]]'s Anjaneyasana 2 is Iyengar's [[Hanumanasana]]; [[Anjani]] is [[Hanuman]]'s mother, and Anjaneya is a [[matronymic]] for Hanuman.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gaia Staff |title=Anjaneyasana: The Lunge Pose |url=https://www.gaia.com/article/lunge-pose-anjaneyasana |publisher=Gaia |date=27 September 2016 |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>}} Jois's asana names almost exactly match Iyengar's.{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|p=50}}\n\n=== Worldwide commodity ===\n[[File:Yoga in public.jpg|thumb|Yoga in public, Jakarta, 2013.

People were for the first time able to travel freely around the world: consumers could go to the east; Indians could migrate to Europe and America; and business people and religious leaders could go where they liked to sell their wares. Secondly, people across the Western world became disillusioned with organised [[religion]], and started to look for alternatives. And thirdly, yoga became an uncontroversial form of exercise suitable for mass consumption, unlike religious forms of [[modern yoga]] such as [[Siddha Yoga]] or [[Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=43}} This involved the dropping of many traditional requirements on the practice of yoga, such as [[Alms|giving alms]], being [[celibate]], studying the [[Hindu scriptures]], and retreating from society.{{sfn|Jain|2015|pp=66-67}}\n\nFrom the 1970s, yoga as exercise spread across many countries of the world, changing as it did so, and becoming \"an integral part of (primarily) urban cultures worldwide\", to the extent that the word ''yoga'' in the Western world now means the practice of asanas, typically in a class.{{efn|The yoga scholar [[Elizabeth De Michelis|De Michelis]] notes that to speakers of Indic languages, ''yoga'' has a \"quite different\" semantic range, including meditation, prayer, ritual and devotional practices, ethical behaviour, and \"secret esoteric techniques\" that average English speakers would not consider to be yoga.<ref name=\"De Michelis 2007\" />}}<ref name=\"De Michelis 2007\">{{cite journal | last=De Michelis | first=Elizabeth | authorlink=Elizabeth De Michelis | title=A Preliminary Survey of Modern Yoga Studies | journal=Asian Medicine, Tradition and Modernity | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=1\u201319 |doi=10.1163/157342107X207182 |url=https://wzukusers.storage.googleapis.com/user-31520575/documents/5a57bf9c24c23ZrCu301/Survey_of_Modern_Yoga_De_Michelis_2007.pdf}}</ref> For example, Iyengar Yoga reached South Africa in 1979 with the opening of its institute at Pietermaritzburg;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://bksiyengar.co.za/about/history/ |publisher=Iyengar Yoga Institute, South Africa |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> its Association of South East & East Asia was founded in 2009.<ref>{{cite book |last=Newcombe |first=Suzanne |authorlink=Suzanne Newcombe |year=2014 |title=The institutionalization of the yoga tradition: ''gurus'' B.

[[Yoga]] in this form has become familiar across the world, especially [[Yoga in America|in America]] and Europe. It is derived from the postures used in the medieval spiritual discipline of [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]], but it is generally simply called \"yoga\"<!--exactly NOT the sense used in article [[yoga]], so do not wikilink-->. Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including '''modern postural yoga''',{{sfn|De Michelis|2004|pp=1-2}}{{efn|In 2004, [[Elizabeth De Michelis]] introduced a typology that subdivided her main category \"[[Modern Yoga]]\" into \"Modern Psychosomatic Yoga\", \"Modern Denominational Yoga\", \"Modern Postural Yoga\" and \"Modern Meditational Yoga\".<ref>The De Michelis 2004 typology can be seen at [https://docs.yuj.it/artefacts/yoga-as-linkage Yoga as Linkage].</ref>}} '''modern transnational yoga''',{{sfn|Brammer|2010|p=1}} and '''transnational anglophone yoga'''.{{sfn|Singleton|2013|p=38}}\n\nPostures were not central in any of the older traditions of [[yoga]]; posture practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]], who emphasised its health benefits. The flowing sequences of [[Salute to the Sun]] (Surya Namaskar) were pioneered by the Rajah of [[Aundh State|Aundh]], [[Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi]], in the 1920s.<ref name=\"ET 2018\">{{cite news |last1=Doctor |first1=Vikram |title=Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi: The man who promoted Surya Namaskar |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bhawanrao-shrinivasrao-pant-pratinidhi-the-man-who-promoted-surya-namaskar/articleshow/64607546.cms |work=The Economic Times (India) |date=15 June 2018}}</ref> It and many [[Standing asanas|standing poses]] used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by the yoga teacher [[Krishnamacharya]] in Mysore from the 1930s to the 1950s. Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga: [[Pattabhi Jois]] created [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]], which in turn led to [[Power Yoga]]; [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] created [[Iyengar Yoga]], and defined a modern set of yoga postures in his 1966 book ''[[Light on Yoga]]''; and [[Indra Devi]] taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood. Other major schools founded in the 20th century include [[Bikram Yoga]] and [[Sivananda Yoga]]. Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world.\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga's non-postural practices such as its [[Satkarma|purifications]] are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise. The term \"hatha yoga\" is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, sometimes [[Yoga for women|mainly for women]]. Practices vary from wholly secular, for exercise and relaxation, through to undoubtedly spiritual, whether in traditions like Sivananda Yoga or in personal rituals. Yoga as exercise's relationship to [[Hinduism]] is complex and contested; some Christians have rejected it on the grounds that it is covertly Hindu, while the \"Take Back Yoga\" campaign insisted that it was necessarily connected to Hinduism.

On 14 April, a debate article was sent to Swedish newspapers signed by 22 academics, claiming that the strategy of the Swedish public health agency will lead to \"chaos in the healthcare system\". Moreover, they claimed that there is no transparency regarding the data used in the models made by the agency. [[Anders Tegnell]] from the public health agency responded to the criticism by saying that there is no lack in transparency in the agency's work and that all data is available to be downloaded by the public as an excel-file on their website. <ref>{{cite web |title=Ann Linde: \u201dForskare om Sveriges strategi: \u201dKommer att bli kaos\u201d\u201d |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=7451820 |website=www.sverigesradio.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>  Additionally Tegnell stated that the numbers of deaths presented in the published article are wrong, especially regarding the specific number of deaths per day. Another claim in the article saying that Sweden's statistics are closing in on to the ones of Italy was countered by Anders Tegnell saying that unlike Sweden, Italy and many other countries only report on deaths in hospitals, making it hard to compare the numbers of the different countries. <ref>{{cite web |title=\"Tegnells svar p\u00e5 skarpa kritiken i DN-debatt: Grundl\u00e4ggande felaktigheter\" |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forskare-kritiska-til-fhm-lat-politikerna-ta-over |website=www.svt.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a survey carried out in late March, three out of four Swedes  trusted the Public Health Agency, and nearly half of the people surveyed (47%) said they had 'very high trust' in the agency.

Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n==Rockula and Frankenstone==\n*'''Count Rockula''': a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away.

Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \"Blood Brothers\" and \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''The New Fred and Barney Show'', again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie.\n*'''Frankenstone''': Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab.

In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.

{"title_page": "Color difference", "text_new": "The '''difference''' or '''distance''' between two colors is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] of interest in [[color science]]. It allows quantified examination of a notion that formerly could only be described with adjectives. Quantification of these properties is of great importance to those whose work is color-critical. Common definitions make use of the [[Euclidean distance]] in a [[device independent]] [[color space]].\n\n==Euclidean==\nAs most definitions of color difference are distances within a [[color space]], the standard means of determining distances is the Euclidean distance. If one presently has an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) tuple and wishes to find the color difference, computationally one of the easiest is to call R, G, B linear dimensions defining the color space.\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{distance} = \\sqrt{ (R_2-R_1)^2+(G_2-G_1)^2 + (B_2-B_1)^2 }</math>\n\nWhen the result should be computationally simple as well, it is often acceptable to remove the square root and simply use:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{distance}^2 = { (R_2-R_1)^2+(G_2-G_1)^2 + (B_2-B_1)^2 }</math>\n\nThis will work in cases when a single color is to be compared to a single color and the need is to simply know whether a distance is greater. If these squared color distances are summed, such a metric effectively becomes the [[variance]] of the color distances.\n\nThere have been many attempts to weight RGB values to better fit human perception, where the components are commonly weighted (red 30%, green 59%, and blue 11%), however these are demonstrably worse at color determinations and are properly the contributions to the brightness of these colors, rather than to the degree to which human vision has less tolerance for these colors. The closer approximations would be more properly:<ref name=euc/>\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\\sqrt{ 2 \\times \\Delta R^2 + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2 + 3 \\times \\Delta B^2 } & \\bar R < 128, \\\\\n\\sqrt{ 3 \\times \\Delta R^2 + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2 + 2 \\times \\Delta B^2 } & otherwise\\end{cases}</math>, \n\nOne of the better low-cost approximations (using a color range of 0&ndash;255) combines the two cases smoothly:<ref name=euc>{{Cite web | url=http://www.compuphase.com/cmetric.htm |title = Colour metric}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\bar r = {{C_{1,R}  + C_{2,R} } \\over 2}</math>\n:<math>\\Delta C = \\sqrt {\\left( {2 + {{\\bar r} \\over {256}}} \\right) \\times \\Delta R^2  + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2  + \\left( {2 + {{255 - \\bar r} \\over {256}}} \\right) \\times \\Delta B^2 }</math>\n\nThere are a number of color distance formulae that attempt to use color spaces like HSV with the hue as a circle, placing the various colors within a three dimensional space of either a cylinder or cone, but most of these are just modifications of RGB; without accounting for differences in human color perception they will tend to be on par with a simple Euclidean metric.\n\n==CIELAB \u0394E*==\nThe [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) calls their distance metric {{math|\u0394''E''<sup>*</sup><sub>''ab''</sub>}} (also called {{math|\u0394''E*''}}, or, inaccurately, {{math|''dE''*}}, {{mvar|dE}}, or \"Delta E\") where [[delta (letter)|delta]] is a [[Greek letter]] often used to denote difference, and '''E''' stands for ''Empfindung''; German for \"sensation\".

Named after the developing committee, their metric is called '''CMC l:c'''. The [[quasimetric]] has two parameters: lightness (l) and chroma (c), allowing the users to weight the difference based on the ratio of l:c that is deemed appropriate for the application. Commonly used values are 2:1<ref>Meaning that the lightness contributes ''half'' as much to the difference (or, identically, is allowed ''twice'' the tolerance) as the chroma</ref> for acceptability and 1:1 for the threshold of imperceptibility.\n\nThe distance of a color <math>(L^*_2,C^*_2,h_2)</math> to a reference <math>(L^*_1,C^*_1,h_1)</math> is:<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce Justin |last=Lindbloom |url=http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_DeltaE_CMC.html |title=Delta E (CMC) |publisher=Brucelindbloom.com |accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\Delta E^*_{CMC} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{L^*_2-L^*_1}{l S_L} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{C^*_2-C^*_1}{c S_C} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\Delta H^*_{ab}}{S_H} \\right)^2 }</math>\n\n: <math>S_L=\\begin{cases} 0.511 & L^*_1 < 16 \\\\ \\frac{0.040975 L^*_1}{1+0.01765 L^*_1} & L^*_1 \\geq 16 \\end{cases} \\quad S_C=\\frac{0.0638 C^*_1}{1+0.0131 C^*_1} + 0.638 \\quad S_H=S_C (FT+1-F)</math>\n\n: <math>F = \\sqrt{\\frac{C^{*^4}_1}{C^{*^4}_1+1900}} \\quad T=\\begin{cases} 0.56 + |0.2 \\cos (h_1+168^\\circ)| & 164^\\circ \\leq h_1 \\leq 345^\\circ \\\\ 0.36 + |0.4 \\cos (h_1+35^\\circ) | & \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nCMC l:c is designed to be used with [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] and the [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|CIE Supplementary Observer]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an10_96ar.pdf| title=CMC| journal=Insight on Color| volume=8| issue=13| date=1-15 October 1996| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312161957/http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an10_96ar.pdf| archive-date=2006-03-12}}</ref> The formula is not a metric but rather a quasimetric because it violates symmetry, parameter T is based on the hue of the <math>h_1</math> alone.

The ellipses are shown ten times their actual size.]]\n\n'''Tolerancing''' concerns the question \"What is a set of colors that are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference?\" If the distance measure is '''''perceptually uniform''''', then the answer is simply \"the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold.\" This requires a perceptually uniform metric in order for the threshold to be constant throughout the [[gamut]] (range of colors). Otherwise, the threshold will be a function of the reference color\u2014cumbersome as a practical guide.\n\nIn the [[CIE 1931 color space]], for example, the tolerance contours are defined by the [[MacAdam ellipse]], which holds L* (lightness) fixed. As can be observed on the adjacent diagram, the [[ellipse]]s denoting the tolerance contours vary in size. It is partly this non-uniformity that led to the creation of [[CIELUV]] and [[CIELAB]].\n\nMore generally, if the lightness is allowed to vary, then we find the tolerance set to be [[ellipsoid]]al. Increasing the weighting factor in the aforementioned distance expressions has the effect of increasing the size of the ellipsoid along the respective axis.<ref name=\"xrite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L10-024_Color_Tolerance_en.pdf|date=14 January 1998|author=Susan Hughes|title=A guide to Understanding Color Tolerancing|accessdate=2014-12-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010064956/http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L10-024_Color_Tolerance_en.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A diagram would handily illustrate the last paragraph.

The closer approximations would be more properly:<ref name=euc/>\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\\sqrt{ 2 \\times \\Delta R^2 + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2 + 3 \\times \\Delta B^2 } & \\bar R < 128, \\\\\n\\sqrt{ 3 \\times \\Delta R^2 + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2 + 2 \\times \\Delta B^2 } & otherwise\\end{cases}</math>, \n\nOne of the better low-cost approximations (using a color range of 0&ndash;255) combines the two cases smoothly:<ref name=euc>{{Cite web | url=http://www.compuphase.com/cmetric.htm |title = Colour metric}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\bar r = {{C_{1,R}  + C_{2,R} } \\over 2}</math>\n:<math>\\Delta C = \\sqrt {\\left( {2 + {{\\bar r} \\over {256}}} \\right) \\times \\Delta R^2  + 4 \\times \\Delta G^2  + \\left( {2 + {{255 - \\bar r} \\over {256}}} \\right) \\times \\Delta B^2 }</math>\n\nThere are a number of color distance formulae that attempt to use color spaces like HSV with the hue as a circle, placing the various colors within a three dimensional space of either a cylinder or cone, but most of these are just modifications of RGB; without accounting for differences in human color perception they will tend to be on par with a simple Euclidean metric.\n\n==CIELAB \u0394E*==\nThe [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) calls their distance metric {{math|\u0394''E''<sup>*</sup><sub>''ab''</sub>}} (also called {{math|\u0394''E*''}}, or, inaccurately, {{math|''dE''*}}, {{mvar|dE}}, or \"Delta E\") where [[delta (letter)|delta]] is a [[Greek letter]] often used to denote difference, and '''E''' stands for ''Empfindung''; German for \"sensation\".

Named after the developing committee, their metric is called '''CMC l:c'''. The [[quasimetric]] has two parameters: lightness (l) and chroma (c), allowing the users to weight the difference based on the ratio of l:c that is deemed appropriate for the application. Commonly used values are 2:1<ref>Meaning that the lightness contributes ''half'' as much to the difference (or, identically, is allowed ''twice'' the tolerance) as the chroma</ref> for acceptability and 1:1 for the threshold of imperceptibility.\n\nThe distance of a color <math>(L^*_2,C^*_2,h_2)</math> to a reference <math>(L^*_1,C^*_1,h_1)</math> is:<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce Justin |last=Lindbloom |url=http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_DeltaE_CMC.html |title=Delta E (CMC) |publisher=Brucelindbloom.com |accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\Delta E^*_{CMC} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{L^*_2-L^*_1}{l S_L} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{C^*_2-C^*_1}{c S_C} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\Delta H^*_{ab}}{S_H} \\right)^2 }</math>\n\n: <math>S_L=\\begin{cases} 0.511 & L^*_1 < 16 \\\\ \\frac{0.040975 L^*_1}{1+0.01765 L^*_1} & L^*_1 \\geq 16 \\end{cases} \\quad S_C=\\frac{0.0638 C^*_1}{1+0.0131 C^*_1} + 0.638 \\quad S_H=S_C (FT+1-F)</math>\n\n: <math>F = \\sqrt{\\frac{C^{*^4}_1}{C^{*^4}_1+1900}} \\quad T=\\begin{cases} 0.56 + |0.2 \\cos (h_1+168^\\circ)| & 164^\\circ \\leq h_1 \\leq 345^\\circ \\\\ 0.36 + |0.4 \\cos (h_1+35^\\circ) | & \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nCMC l:c is designed to be used with [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] and the [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|CIE Supplementary Observer]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an10_96ar.pdf| title=CMC| journal=Insight on Color| volume=8| issue=13| date=1-15 October 1996| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312161957/http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an10_96ar.pdf| archive-date=2006-03-12}}</ref> The formula is not a metric but rather a quasimetric because it violates symmetry, parameter T is based on the hue of the <math>h_1</math> alone.

The ellipses are shown ten times their actual size.]]\n\n'''Tolerancing''' concerns the question \"What is a set of colors that are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference?\" If the distance measure is '''''perceptually uniform''''', then the answer is simply \"the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold.\" This requires a perceptually uniform metric in order for the threshold to be constant throughout the [[gamut]] (range of colors). Otherwise, the threshold will be a function of the reference color\u2014cumbersome as a practical guide.\n\nIn the [[CIE 1931 color space]], for example, the tolerance contours are defined by the [[MacAdam ellipse]], which holds L* (lightness) fixed. As can be observed on the adjacent diagram, the [[ellipse]]s denoting the tolerance contours vary in size. It is partly this non-uniformity that led to the creation of [[CIELUV]] and [[CIELAB]].\n\nMore generally, if the lightness is allowed to vary, then we find the tolerance set to be [[ellipsoid]]al. Increasing the weighting factor in the aforementioned distance expressions has the effect of increasing the size of the ellipsoid along the respective axis.<ref name=\"xrite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L10-024_Color_Tolerance_en.pdf|date=14 January 1998|author=Susan Hughes|title=A guide to Understanding Color Tolerancing|accessdate=2014-12-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010064956/http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L10-024_Color_Tolerance_en.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A diagram would handily illustrate the last paragraph.

The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the short [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the [[Pyli|Porta Pass]], and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts.

The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as Crete. The fate of [[Independent Albania|Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=330\u2013332}}\n\n==Notes==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Apostolidis |first=Dimitrios |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1912-1913|trans-title=The Victorious Greco-Turkish War of 1912-1913|volume=I|publisher=Estia|location=Athens|language=Greek|year=1913|url=https://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/8/d/1/metadata-9272bd94229998ed96a378ab0f986a22_1270023610.tkl|accessdate=13 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Blackburn|first1=Bonnie|last2=Holford-Strevens|first2=Leofranc|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Georgios|last1=Christopoulos|first2=Ioannis|last2=Bastias|title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf 1881 \u03c9\u03c2 1913|trans-title=History of the Greek Nation: Modern Greece from 1881 until 1913 |volume=XIV |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1977 |isbn=960-213-110-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dimitracopoulos |first=Anastasios |title=The First Balkan War Through the Pages of Review L'Illustration |year=1992 |publisher=Hellenic Committee of Military History|location=Athens |oclc= 37043754| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Edward |title=Defeat in Detail: The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912-1913 |year=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport | isbn =978-0-275-97888-4| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hooton |first=Edward|title=Prelude to the First World War: The Balkan Wars 1912-1913 |year=2014|publisher=Fonthill Media|location=Stroud | isbn =978-1781551806  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kargakos |first=Sarandos| title=\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (1912-1913)|trans-title=Greece in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913)| publisher=Peritechnon|location=Athens| year = 2012 | isbn =978-960-8411-26-5|language=Greek| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Katsikostas |first=Dimitrios |title=\u0397 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 Eydoux|trans-title=The Reorganization of the Armed Forces and the Efforts of the French Military Mission of Eydoux|publisher= Hellenic Army History Directorate |language=Greek|year= 2014 |url=https://dis.army.gr/sites/dis.army.gr/files/unmanaged/pdf/Articles_June14/Greek_French/ANADIORG_ED_APOST_EYDOUX.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2019 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Klapsis |first=Antonis |date=2009 |title=Between the Hammer and the Anvil.

He taught Adult Literacy at Blackwood Community College and the Ebbw Vale Institute. Jones is also active in setting up various reading and writing workshops throughout Wales from schools to youth centres. He has also served as the Creative Literacy Worker for the Cynon Project and in 1988 was writer in residence at [[Swansea College]]. He has worked in collaboration with Hafan Cymru, Ty Hapus, Literature Wales and The Welsh National Opera.\n\nJones has made various television and radio appearances, and is probably Wales' most prominent living literary figure.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He participated in a week-long intensive writing masterclass with Arnold Wesker at [[Hay on Wye]] Literature Festival in 1997. Jones participated in the 1998 Dysfluency Tour. In April 1999, he staged a Kosovo benefit at Blackwood Miner's Institute involving [[Max Boyce]], [[James Dean Bradfield]] and other artists. Later that year he read from and discussed sections of his play ''Everything Must Go'' at Marxism '99. 1999 also saw Ioan Gruffydd, Matthew Rhys and other Welsh celebrities performing his poem \"The Guerrilla Tapestry\" at the opening of the [[Welsh Assembly]] 'Voices of a Nation' concert. In 2004, he returned to the [[Hay Festival]] for a discussion with James Dean Bradfield on music, politics and writing.\n\nJones has worked with St David's Foundation Hospice Care, The Samaritans, [[Hope and Aid Direct]] and Learning through Growth in the [[Cynon Valley]].. Has been involved in many protests including Save St David's Woods, and Justice for Fathers.  In 2007 he performed a reading at a fundraising concert for Stop The War, during which he also collaborated with Newport band New State Radio.\n\nJones' play, ''Revelation'', spoke out on behalf of victims of female domestic violence.
