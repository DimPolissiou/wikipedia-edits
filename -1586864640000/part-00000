She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.<ref name=\"matthau\"/>\n\n===''The Simpsons''===\nCastellaneta is most famous for his role as [[Homer Simpson]] on the longest running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' included a series of animated shorts about a [[dysfunctional family]].

The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace. These advantages make BIPV one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe term '''building-applied photovoltaics''' ('''BAPV''') is sometimes used to refer to photovoltaics that are a retrofit \u2013 integrated into the building after construction is complete.

Aluminum-framed photovoltaic modules were connected to, or mounted on, buildings that were usually in remote areas without access to an electric power grid. In the 1980s photovoltaic module add-ons to roofs began being demonstrated. These PV systems were usually installed on utility-grid-connected buildings in areas with centralized power stations.
