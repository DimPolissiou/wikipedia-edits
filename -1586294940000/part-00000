Galley's two goal performance tied the regular season finale with Philadelphia, which meant that Washington won the standings tiebreaker and finished second in the Patrick Division.  This would be crucial as it gave the Caps home ice advantage in their first-round matchup with the defending division and conference champion Flyers.\n\nPhilly showed a champion's mettle right away, though, stealing home ice away with a 4-2 victory in Game 1.  Ron Hextall made 35 saves and Dave Poulin's 3rd period power play tally broke a 2-2 tie.  Washington salvaged a split at home with a 5-4 triumph in Game 2.  Despite letting in a quartet of Philly goals, Pete Peeters proved to be the final period hero, stopping 14 of 15 shots from a pressing Flyers attack.\n\nPhiladelphia then turned the tables back at their place, taking a pair of one-goal games, both of them high in drama for entirely different reasons.  In Game 3, a 4-3 Flyers win, officials handed out 40 penalties, including 10 major/misconduct penalties.  After the game Philly forward Rick Tocchet, who spent roughly half the contest in the penalty box, was quoted as saying, \"There are 10 guys on that team that I'd like to kill.\"\n\nThe rivalry heated up further in Game 4 as both teams tried to change momentum with goalie switches.  The Capitals yanked Peeters in favor of starting Clint Malarchuk, who had played more during the regular season.  Despite missing starting defensemen Scott Stevens and team captain Rod Langway, who were injured in Game 3, the move seemed to be paying dividends as Washington took a 4-1 lead with 17:00 to go, resulting in Hextall's removal for backup Mark Laforest.  The Caps maintained their 3-goal advantage into the final 9:00 of the game, when the Flyers began one of their most riveting comebacks in franchise history.  Mark Howe and Brian Propp scored to cut the deficit to one and then, after pulling their new netminder, the tying tally came from defenseman Kjell Samuelsson with :53 remaining.  When Murray Craven lit the lamp just 1:18 into overtime, the rally was complete and Philadelphia had a 5-4 win.  Howe said after, \"If we play that game 250 times, we win it once.\"\n\nNow facing elimination, the Capitals returned home and showed no fear as they again knocked Hextall out of the game after posting a 4-1 lead, but this time it only took 29 minutes.  Washington would go on to win easily this time, 5-2.  The final Philadelphia goal came on a power play in the second period after the team asked to check goalie Pete Peeters' stick, which was ruled to be wider than permitted by the rules.  Peeters admitted all his sticks were the same and so he had to use one of backup Clint Malarchuk's sticks for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Flyers now had a chance to clinch the series at home in Game 6, which would be another penalty-filled contest.  It was highlighted (or lowlighted, depending on your point of view) by Philadelphia defenseman Greg Smyth spending 27 minutes in the sin bin.  Given all the infractions, it was no surprise that the difference in the game was special teams.  But while Philadelphia went a pedestrian 1-for-8 on the power play, Washington was a scintillating 4-of-9.  The key play in the game was Flyers forward Dave Brown trying to fight Caps counterpart Bobby Gould.  However, assistant captain Gould shrewdly went turtle, covering up, and letting Brown whale on him a couple times before officials stepped in.  Gould went back to the bench as Brown's fighting major gave the Capitals, who were already ahead 2-0, a 5:00 power play, during which they scored twice to blow the game open.  Washington romped to a 7-2 triumph with 7 different goal scorers to set up the 7th and deciding game back in D.C.\n\nIn a series full of twists and turns (some of them being highly illegal and downright nasty), the final turn of them all came in one of the more exciting Game 7's in Stanley Cup playoff history.  But first, one last bit of nasty had to be doled out.  During a Flyer power play late in a scoreless first period, Capitals defenseman Grant Ledyard didn't like the way Flyers forward Rick Tocchet checked him to the ice in front of the Washington goal.  Ledyard promptly speared Tocchet in the groin with the blade of his stick and received a 5-minute major and a game misconduct.  Tim Kerr would score during the Ledyard penalty, giving the Flyers a 1-0 lead after the 1st period.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for the Caps as the 1-goal deficit was tripled less than 3:00 into the 2nd period on markers by Brian Propp and Mark Howe.  Just like Game 4, one team had a 3-goal lead and all the momentum.  But momentum's a funny thing.  It changed four minutes later when Dale Hunter, who was picked up in the offseason from the Quebec Nordiques, fired a backwards cross-ice pass to a wide open Garry Galley who beat Ron Hextall with a slapshot.  With the Capital Centre crowd now in full throat, Washington kept up the pressure and forced an icing and an offensive zone faceoff.  Mike Ridley dueled with Peter Zezel and the puck was kicked and dribbled right in front of the crease where Kelly Miller stuffed it under Hextall's pads.  Two goals in about 90 seconds and it was a brand new hockey game.\n\nBut just when the actual play on the ice looked to be returning to center stage, tempers flared again.  As the Caps rushed up ice for the tying goal, forward Dave Christian fired a high shot that Hextall jumped to try to corral on his chest, Washington defenseman Kevin Hatcher, charging the net for a rebound, lowered the boom and ran right over the Flyer netminder, earning him a minor penalty and putting the three officials quickly to work to break up the players before any punches could be thrown.  Hatcher would atone for his mistake before the period was out.\n\nPhiladelphia tried to clear from their defensive half-wall, but failed to flip the puck over the 6'3\" defenseman.  Hatcher gloved it down at the blue line and walked in to fire a wicked slapshot that beat Hextall shortside to tie the game.  Just as Philadelphia needed less than twenty minutes to erase a 3-goal deficit in Game 4, Washington had done the same in Game 7.  However, there was still a whole 3rd period to go.\n\nJust over 5:00 into the 3rd, Kjell Samuelsson was sent off the ice for tripping Peter Sundstrom.  Washington was so potent in the previous game with the man advantage, but had failed to score in this contest despite over 9 1/2 minutes of power play time.  They apparently didn't want to waste any more.  The Caps won the offensive zone faceoff and Hatcher took the puck and passed across the blue line to Garry Galley.  Galley fired low at the target, but Dale Hunter stopped the attempt about halfway to the net and re-shot the puck.  Hextall, already down trying to catch the Galley shot, didn't have a chance to readjust.  The light went on and the Capitals had taken a 4-3 lead with just under 15:00 to go, needing only 6 seconds of their power play to score.\n\nBut Philadelphia was not about to go quietly.  Just over a minute later, the Flyers won a faceoff in their offensive zone and the puck came back to defenseman Brad Marsh who fired a low shot that somehow found its way through the legs and sticks of a half-dozen players before zooming past Peeters and into the net for the tying goal.  Again, imitiation was the sincerest form of flattery in this series, although it had been defined by flattening throughout.  Both defenses tightened up and very few scoring chances came for the rest of regulation and the game would go to overtime tied 4-4.\n\nHaving already lost one dramatic overtime game in the series and still stinging from the heartbreak of the previous season's quadruple-overtime playoff loss at home in Game 7 in the famed Easter Epic (rated the #7 game in New York Islanders history), Capitals fans were not relishing bonus hockey.  Adding to the uncertainty was whether all the bad blood that had been spilled in this series might dramatically affect the outcome.  No one knew how this one was going to end.\n\nIt almost ended in less than 5 seconds.  Philadelphia won the opening faceoff and Mark Howe skated across the red line and fired a long, high slapshot.  Pete Peeters reached up to catch it, but the puck deflected off his glove and came down just high and wide of the goal.  Neither team had a real decent scoring opportunity, though, until a Washington defensive clear wound up springing Mike Gartner on a breakaway.  As the Caps leading goal scorer tried to catch up to the pass, he was hooked down from behind by Mark Howe, giving the Capitals a rare overtime power play.\n\nWashington had Hextall out of position three times early in the man advantage, but couldn't get a clean shot away.  Then, as things looked to be cooling off, Scott Stevens was taken down, but still managed to get the puck over to Mike Ridley on the left side.  He slid it back to Gartner who was all alone 10 feet in front of the net.  Gartner's shot beat Hextall clean glove-side-high, but didn't beat the crossbar, marking the third time in the game the iron had repelled a Washington scoring chance.  Adding insult to, well, insult, the rebound then dropped almost straight down into the crease where it bounced over Dale Hunter's sweeping stick, which had nothing between it and the open net.  The ensuing chaotic scramble would send Philly's Brian Propp on a shorthanded breakaway down the right wing.  His first shot found the right pad of Peeters, and his rebound attempt was scooped by Peeters' glove.\n\nLess than a minute later, Gartner was sprung again by Ridley down his favored right wing.  Gartner beat one defenseman, drew the second one to him, and then sent a perfect pass across to Peter Sundstrom.  The redirect was on target, but Hextall somehow got back to make arguably his best save of the series, robbing Sundstrom from point-blank range.  Washington kept the pressure on and about a minute later almost won it again, this time it was Hunter from behind the net setting up Bobby Gould, whose backhand one-timer from just above the crease was kicked out by Hextall's stick.\n\nGould would get another shot after Washington retrieved Philadelphia's clear and Murray Craven skated the loose puck out of the Flyer zone.  He got as far as the Caps blue line where he was poke-checked by Larry Murphy.  Craven tried to return the favor as he went off the ice for a line change, but the puck bounced off Scott Stevens' skate and came right back to Murphy.  That's when Murphy looked up and saw Hunter making a hard u-turn just past the red line with his stick raised.  Hunter perfectly split three Flyers and Murphy hit him in stride right at the blue line.  Hunter cruised in and later said he didn't know what he was going to do until the last moment when he saw an opening between Hextall's pads.  The man who six years earlier won a deciding Game 5 (best-of-5 series) for Quebec with an overtime goal against Montreal, feathered a slithering shot that hit the back of the net 5:57 into overtime, giving the Capitals a thrilling 5-4 victory and a 4-games-to-3 series triumph.\n\nThe game would not only be one of the most disheartening and gutwrenching for Flyer fans, it would also be the last for Philadelphia's young crackerjack head coach Mike Keenan, who left in the offseason to take the head job with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAs for Washington, the victory was recently voted the #1 game in the history of the franchise.\n  \n'''*********************************************************************************************************'''\n\nSadly, the historic win did not propel the Capitals very far.  Facing the New Jersey Devils in the Patrick Division Finals, Washington again could not keep their home ice advantage.  After winning Game 1 3-1 behind 33 saves from Pete Peeters, the Capitals dropped Game 2 at home 5-2 as Aaron Broten had a hat trick for the Devils.\n\nJersey doubled their Game 2 score in Game 3, winning by a stunning 10-4 margin behind a pair of hat tricks.  Mark Johnson scored 4 times and Peter Sundstrom's twin brother, Patrik, torched his sibling's squad with 3 goals and 5 assists, the 8 points setting a new Stanley Cup playoff record.  Peeters was yanked after giving up 3 goals on just 10 shots in the first period, but replacement Clint Malarchuk did even worse, stopping only 14 of the 21 shots he faced.\n\nWashington rebounded with a 4-1 win in Game 4 behind a pair of Dave Christian goals and coach Bryan Murray actually splitting time between his goalies.  But New Jersey stole Game 5 right back in D.C. by a 3-1 count as Bob Sauve started in place of Sean Burke in net and stopped 28 shots.\n\nDown 3-2 and facing elimination on the road, Washington impressively forced Game 7 with an eerily identical 7-2 victory from the previous series in which again, amazingly, 7 different Capitals scored, including power play goals from Gartner and Hunter.\n\nThis time, however, there was no magical comeback as John McLean's tally proved to be the gamewinner in a 3-2 triumph that sent the Devils on to their first conference final.  In a most unusual twist, the road team won 5 of the 7 games in the series.\n\n'''*********************************************************************************************************'''\n\nAs a final note, the playoffs ended in bizarre fashion.  After a Game 3 loss to Boston in those conference finals, New Jersey coach Jim Schoenfeld and referee Don Koharski got into a heated argument during which Koharski tripped and fell, accusing Schoenfeld of pushing him.  Schoenfield famously responded, \"You tripped and fell, you fat pig!\"  Then, he added \"Have another doughnut!  Have another doughnut!\"  Boston would win the series in seven games and advance to face Edmonton in the finals.  Schoenfeld would be fired a couple years later and go on to coach the Capitals for four seasons in the mid-1990s.\n\nFacing being swept at home in Game 4 of the finals, the Bruins apparently tried to use some of the Celtic magic their Boston Garden counterparts had made famous over the years.  The sweltering heat outside resulted in the ice surface being shrouded in fog and slowed the vaunted Oiler attack.  Then the building suffered a power overload, plunging the Garden into darkness.  The blackout was presumably caused by the air conditioning system short-circuiting from running on full power for too long.  League rules stated that the game (which was tied at 3 in the 2nd period) had to be canceled and made up in Boston at the end of the series, if necessary, making it a 2-1-1-1-1-1 format.  It wasn't necessary as Edmonton completed the rare 4-game sweep in 5 games with a 6-3 victory.\n\nDJSII\n\n==Player statistics==\n\n===Regular season===\n;Scoring\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\"\n!

Galley's two goal performance tied the regular season finale with Philadelphia, which meant that Washington won the standings tiebreaker and finished second in the Patrick Division.  This would be crucial as it gave the Caps home ice advantage in their first-round matchup with the defending division and conference champion Flyers.\n\nPhilly showed a champion's mettle right away, though, stealing home ice away with a 4-2 victory in Game 1.  Ron Hextall made 35 saves and Dave Poulin's 3rd period power play tally broke a 2-2 tie.  Washington salvaged a split at home with a 5-4 triumph in Game 2.  Despite letting in a quartet of Philly goals, Pete Peeters proved to be the final period hero, stopping 14 of 15 shots from a pressing Flyers attack.\n\nPhiladelphia then turned the tables back at their place, taking a pair of one-goal games, both of them high in drama for entirely different reasons.  In Game 3, a 4-3 Flyers win, officials handed out 40 penalties, including 10 major/misconduct penalties.  After the game Philly forward Rick Tocchet, who spent roughly half the contest in the penalty box, was quoted as saying, \"There are 10 guys on that team that I'd like to kill.\"\n\nThe rivalry heated up further in Game 4 as both teams tried to change momentum with goalie switches.  The Capitals yanked Peeters in favor of starting Clint Malarchuk, who had played more during the regular season.  Despite missing starting defensemen Scott Stevens and team captain Rod Langway, who were injured in Game 3, the move seemed to be paying dividends as Washington took a 4-1 lead with 17:00 to go, resulting in Hextall's removal for backup Mark Laforest.  The Caps maintained their 3-goal advantage into the final 9:00 of the game, when the Flyers began one of their most riveting comebacks in franchise history.  Mark Howe and Brian Propp scored to cut the deficit to one and then, after pulling their new netminder, the tying tally came from defenseman Kjell Samuelsson with :53 remaining.  When Murray Craven lit the lamp just 1:18 into overtime, the rally was complete and Philadelphia had a 5-4 win.  Howe said after, \"If we play that game 250 times, we win it once.\"\n\nNow facing elimination, the Capitals returned home and showed no fear as they again knocked Hextall out of the game after posting a 4-1 lead, but this time it only took 29 minutes.  Washington would go on to win easily this time, 5-2.  The final Philadelphia goal came on a power play in the second period after the team asked to check goalie Pete Peeters' stick, which was ruled to be wider than permitted by the rules.  Peeters admitted all his sticks were the same and so he had to use one of backup Clint Malarchuk's sticks for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Flyers now had a chance to clinch the series at home in Game 6, which would be another penalty-filled contest.  It was highlighted (or lowlighted, depending on your point of view) by Philadelphia defenseman Greg Smyth spending 27 minutes in the sin bin.  Given all the infractions, it was no surprise that the difference in the game was special teams.  But while Philadelphia went a pedestrian 1-for-8 on the power play, Washington was a scintillating 4-of-9.  The key play in the game was Flyers forward Dave Brown trying to fight Caps counterpart Bobby Gould.  However, assistant captain Gould shrewdly went turtle, covering up, and letting Brown whale on him a couple times before officials stepped in.  Gould went back to the bench as Brown's fighting major gave the Capitals, who were already ahead 2-0, a 5:00 power play, during which they scored twice to blow the game open.  Washington romped to a 7-2 triumph with 7 different goal scorers to set up the 7th and deciding game back in D.C.\n\nIn a series full of twists and turns (some of them being highly illegal and downright nasty), the final turn of them all came in one of the more exciting Game 7's in Stanley Cup playoff history.  But first, one last bit of nasty had to be doled out.  During a Flyer power play late in a scoreless first period, Capitals defenseman Grant Ledyard didn't like the way Flyers forward Rick Tocchet checked him to the ice in front of the Washington goal.  Ledyard promptly speared Tocchet in the groin with the blade of his stick and received a 5-minute major and a game misconduct.  Tim Kerr would score during the Ledyard penalty, giving the Flyers a 1-0 lead after the 1st period.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for the Caps as the 1-goal deficit was tripled less than 3:00 into the 2nd period on markers by Brian Propp and Mark Howe.  Just like Game 4, one team had a 3-goal lead and all the momentum.  But momentum's a funny thing.  It changed four minutes later when Dale Hunter, who was picked up in the offseason from the Quebec Nordiques, fired a backwards cross-ice pass to a wide open Garry Galley who beat Ron Hextall with a slapshot.  With the Capital Centre crowd now in full throat, Washington kept up the pressure and forced an icing and an offensive zone faceoff.  Mike Ridley dueled with Peter Zezel and the puck was kicked and dribbled right in front of the crease where Kelly Miller stuffed it under Hextall's pads.  Two goals in about 90 seconds and it was a brand new hockey game.\n\nBut just when the actual play on the ice looked to be returning to center stage, tempers flared again.  As the Caps rushed up ice for the tying goal, forward Dave Christian fired a high shot that Hextall jumped to try to corral on his chest, Washington defenseman Kevin Hatcher, charging the net for a rebound, lowered the boom and ran right over the Flyer netminder, earning him a minor penalty and putting the three officials quickly to work to break up the players before any punches could be thrown.  Hatcher would atone for his mistake before the period was out.\n\nPhiladelphia tried to clear from their defensive half-wall, but failed to flip the puck over the 6'3\" defenseman.  Hatcher gloved it down at the blue line and walked in to fire a wicked slapshot that beat Hextall shortside to tie the game.  Just as Philadelphia needed less than twenty minutes to erase a 3-goal deficit in Game 4, Washington had done the same in Game 7.  However, there was still a whole 3rd period to go.\n\nJust over 5:00 into the 3rd, Kjell Samuelsson was sent off the ice for tripping Peter Sundstrom.  Washington was so potent in the previous game with the man advantage, but had failed to score in this contest despite over 9 1/2 minutes of power play time.  They apparently didn't want to waste any more.  The Caps won the offensive zone faceoff and Hatcher took the puck and passed across the blue line to Garry Galley.  Galley fired low at the target, but Dale Hunter stopped the attempt about halfway to the net and re-shot the puck.  Hextall, already down trying to catch the Galley shot, didn't have a chance to readjust.  The light went on and the Capitals had taken a 4-3 lead with just under 15:00 to go, needing only 6 seconds of their power play to score.\n\nBut Philadelphia was not about to go quietly.  Just over a minute later, the Flyers won a faceoff in their offensive zone and the puck came back to defenseman Brad Marsh who fired a low shot that somehow found its way through the legs and sticks of a half-dozen players before zooming past Peeters and into the net for the tying goal.  Again, imitiation was the sincerest form of flattery in this series, although it had been defined by flattening throughout.  Both defenses tightened up and very few scoring chances came for the rest of regulation and the game would go to overtime tied 4-4.\n\nHaving already lost one dramatic overtime game in the series and still stinging from the heartbreak of the previous season's quadruple-overtime playoff loss at home in Game 7 in the famed Easter Epic (rated the #7 game in New York Islanders history), Capitals fans were not relishing bonus hockey.  Adding to the uncertainty was whether all the bad blood that had been spilled in this series might dramatically affect the outcome.  No one knew how this one was going to end.\n\nIt almost ended in less than 5 seconds.  Philadelphia won the opening faceoff and Mark Howe skated across the red line and fired a long, high slapshot.  Pete Peeters reached up to catch it, but the puck deflected off his glove and came down just high and wide of the goal.  Neither team had a real decent scoring opportunity, though, until a Washington defensive clear wound up springing Mike Gartner on a breakaway.  As the Caps leading goal scorer tried to catch up to the pass, he was hooked down from behind by Mark Howe, giving the Capitals a rare overtime power play.\n\nWashington had Hextall out of position three times early in the man advantage, but couldn't get a clean shot away.  Then, as things looked to be cooling off, Scott Stevens was taken down, but still managed to get the puck over to Mike Ridley on the left side.  He slid it back to Gartner who was all alone 10 feet in front of the net.  Gartner's shot beat Hextall clean glove-side-high, but didn't beat the crossbar, marking the third time in the game the iron had repelled a Washington scoring chance.  Adding insult to, well, insult, the rebound then dropped almost straight down into the crease where it bounced over Dale Hunter's sweeping stick, which had nothing between it and the open net.  The ensuing chaotic scramble would send Philly's Brian Propp on a shorthanded breakaway down the right wing.  His first shot found the right pad of Peeters, and his rebound attempt was scooped by Peeters' glove.\n\nLess than a minute later, Gartner was sprung again by Ridley down his favored right wing.  Gartner beat one defenseman, drew the second one to him, and then sent a perfect pass across to Peter Sundstrom.  The redirect was on target, but Hextall somehow got back to make arguably his best save of the series, robbing Sundstrom from point-blank range.  Washington kept the pressure on and about a minute later almost won it again, this time it was Hunter from behind the net setting up Bobby Gould, whose backhand one-timer from just above the crease was kicked out by Hextall's stick.\n\nGould would get another shot after Washington retrieved Philadelphia's clear and Murray Craven skated the loose puck out of the Flyer zone.  He got as far as the Caps blue line where he was poke-checked by Larry Murphy.  Craven tried to return the favor as he went off the ice for a line change, but the puck bounced off Scott Stevens' skate and came right back to Murphy.  That's when Murphy looked up and saw Hunter making a hard u-turn just past the red line with his stick raised.  Hunter perfectly split three Flyers and Murphy hit him in stride right at the blue line.  Hunter cruised in and later said he didn't know what he was going to do until the last moment when he saw an opening between Hextall's pads.  The man who six years earlier won a deciding Game 5 (best-of-5 series) for Quebec with an overtime goal against Montreal, feathered a slithering shot that hit the back of the net 5:57 into overtime, giving the Capitals a thrilling 5-4 victory and a 4-games-to-3 series triumph.\n\nThe game would not only be one of the most disheartening and gutwrenching for Flyer fans, it would also be the last for Philadelphia's young crackerjack head coach Mike Keenan, who left in the offseason to take the head job with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAs for Washington, the victory was recently voted the #1 game in the history of the franchise.\n  \n'''*********************************************************************************************************'''\n\nSadly, the historic win did not propel the Capitals very far.  Facing the New Jersey Devils in the Patrick Division Finals, Washington again could not keep their home ice advantage.  After winning Game 1 3-1 behind 33 saves from Pete Peeters, the Capitals dropped Game 2 at home 5-2 as Aaron Broten had a hat trick for the Devils.\n\nJersey doubled their Game 2 score in Game 3, winning by a stunning 10-4 margin behind a pair of hat tricks.  Mark Johnson scored 4 times and Peter Sundstrom's twin brother, Patrik, torched his sibling's squad with 3 goals and 5 assists, the 8 points setting a new Stanley Cup playoff record.  Peeters was yanked after giving up 3 goals on just 10 shots in the first period, but replacement Clint Malarchuk did even worse, stopping only 14 of the 21 shots he faced.\n\nWashington rebounded with a 4-1 win in Game 4 behind a pair of Dave Christian goals and coach Bryan Murray actually splitting time between his goalies.  But New Jersey stole Game 5 right back in D.C. by a 3-1 count as Bob Sauve started in place of Sean Burke in net and stopped 28 shots.\n\nDown 3-2 and facing elimination on the road, Washington impressively forced Game 7 with an eerily identical 7-2 victory from the previous series in which again, amazingly, 7 different Capitals scored, including power play goals from Gartner and Hunter.\n\nThis time, however, there was no magical comeback as John McLean's tally proved to be the gamewinner in a 3-2 triumph that sent the Devils on to their first conference final.  In a most unusual twist, the road team won 5 of the 7 games in the series.\n\n'''*********************************************************************************************************'''\n\nAs a final note, the playoffs ended in bizarre fashion.  After a Game 3 loss to Boston in those conference finals, New Jersey coach Jim Schoenfeld and referee Don Koharski got into a heated argument during which Koharski tripped and fell, accusing Schoenfeld of pushing him.  Schoenfield famously responded, \"You tripped and fell, you fat pig!\"  Then, he added \"Have another doughnut!  Have another doughnut!\"  Boston would win the series in seven games and advance to face Edmonton in the finals.  Schoenfeld would be fired a couple years later and go on to coach the Capitals for four seasons in the mid-'90's.\n\nFacing being swept at home in Game 4 of the finals, the Bruins apparently tried to use some of the Celtic magic their Boston Garden counterparts had made famous over the years.  The sweltering heat outside resulted in the ice surface being shrouded in fog and slowed the vaunted Oiler attack.  Then the building suffered a power overload, plunging the Garden into darkness.  The blackout was presumably caused by the air conditioning system short-circuiting from running on full power for too long.  League rules stated that the game (which was tied at 3 in the 2nd period) had to be canceled and made up in Boston at the end of the series, if necessary, making it a 2-1-1-1-1-1 format.  It wasn't necessary as Edmonton completed the rare 4-game sweep in 5 games with a 6-3 victory.\n\nDJSII\n\n==Player statistics==\n\n===Regular season===\n;Scoring\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\"\n!

As in the previous game, the game uses the Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit, an in-world heads-up display ([[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]) system that uses holograms projected from Isaac's suit and weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count. In vacuum areas, a timer appears on Isaac's right shoulder, counting how much oxygen his suit has before he [[Asphyxia|suffocates]]. The RIG also uses gauges on Isaac's back to display his health and stasis module levels. If Isaac's health or air reaches zero, or if the player fails to survive a quick-time event, Isaac will die, forcing the player to restart from the last checkpoint.<ref name=steam_manual>{{cite web|title=Dead Space 2 Manual|url=http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=2 March 2013|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522160511/http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|archivedate=May 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game, Isaac acquires the stasis module, which slows down enemies and otherwise-impassable moving obstacles (e.g. active heavy machinery) to allow Isaac to pass through safely; and the kinesis module, which allows Isaac to carry and fire objects [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. The player can upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using power nodes. There are also [[Automated retail|automated store]]s, where the player can buy and sell various items, and gain new weapons and suits through acquiring schematics found throughout the Sprawl.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nThroughout the game, the player will come across different puzzles that impede progress. In some cases, Isaac must [[hacker (computer security)|hack]] consoles to activate machines and open doors; in others, Isaac must repair or reposition mechanisms to proceed. The player regularly encounters [[Weightlessness|zero-G]] environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering in all directions with [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] attached to his suit. Both normal and zero-G environments may be in areas within the vacuum of outer space; in these situations, Isaac must refill his limited oxygen supply via oxygen dispensers.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nMuch like in the first game, Isaac must fight the Necromorphs, organisms that mutate and take control of human corpses. To take down Necromorphs, the player must use \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\": in other words, slicing off limbs or sections of the Necromorphs' bodies.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Dead Space 2|developer=[[Visceral Games]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=25 January 2011|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|version=1.02-1.1|level=Chapter 2|quote='''Sorenson (audio log)''': Listen up, this is Sorenson from CEC.

Item drops and credits are more rare, enemies are more challenging, and checkpoints are absent.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer in ''Dead Space 2'', also known as Outbreak mode, pits two four-player teams of human Sprawl Security forces and the Necromorphs against each other in different locations and scenarios. The Humans complete various mission objectives before time runs out, such as activating escape pods and destroying machines; whilst the Necromorphs simply prevent the Humans from completing said objectives. There are two rounds per match, with each team switching sides at the end of the round.<ref name=steam_manual /> Human player characters start with two weapons in their arsenal, starting with the standard Pulse Rifle and Plasma Cutter, before unlocking new weapons to use. For Humans, new weapons and improvements are unlocked through level progression, along with different suits similar to the ones in single player for the humans. Necromorph players, on the other hand, unlock boosts to their current abilities, health, and damage. Necromorph players can choose the Necromorph they will spawn as: a Lurker, a Puker, a Spitter, or a member of the Pack. In order to use stronger Necromorphs, like the Puker and Spitter, the player must wait for a number of seconds on the respawn screen before that type is usable. Whilst Sprawl Security players spawn in their main spawn areas, Necromorph players spawn through vents and floor panels all over the map, and can choose their spawn point on the spawn screen.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\n==Plot==\n===Background===\nDuring the 23rd century, Earth's population found themselves suffering resource and energy crises, causing world government EarthGov to begin research on solutions. The former was resolved with \"planet-cracker\" spaceships, created to smash and harvest other planets for resources, and the latter with an investigation of a black alien monolith discovered in the [[Chicxulub crater]], which emits a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]]. Dubbed \"The Marker\", the monolith begins causing violent [[psychoses]] in people near to it, prompting lead researcher Michael Altman to try and leak its existence; assassinating Altman too late, EarthGov inadvertently turns him into a [[martyr]], leading to the formation of the Church of Unitology, a cult that uses the marker as a [[Idolatry|religious idol]].\n\nDuring the events of the first game, set in 2508, CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke was a member of the ''USG Kellion'', a ship that responded to a distress call from planet-cracker ''USG Ishimura''; Isaac himself joined as the crew-member who sent the distress signal was his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan. Crashing into the ship due to a malfunction, the ''Ishimura'' was found to be overrun with hostile monsters (dubbed \"necromorphs\"), created from the reanimated, mutated corpses of the crew. Isaac soon learns that the ''Ishimura'' uncovered a man-made Red Marker on Aegis VII, its disturbance causing homicidal insanity and the spread of the necromorph infestation. Trying to return the Red Marker to Aegis VII, Isaac is betrayed by ''Kellion'' crew member Kendra Daniels, who intends to steal the marker.\n\nWith the help of Nicole, Isaac returned the marker to the planet, subduing the necromorph Hive-Mind but triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that indirectly disabled the [[artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the planet together. Isacc then learns from Daniels that Nicole has long since committed suicide; Isaac's interactions with Nicole were [[hallucination]]s caused by the Red Marker. Daniels, removing the marker to try and steal it, reawakens the Hive-Mind in the process, which crushes her to death. Isaac kills the Hive-Mind and narrowly escapes the planetary collapse on a ship, only to be be attacked by a hallucination of Nicole.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThree years after the Aegis VII event, Isaac Clarke awakens on the Sprawl, a civilian space-station built onto the remnants of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Isaac wakes amidst a necromorph outbreak, with no memory of the past few years and suffering severe hallucinations. Narrowly escaping as people are murdered and commit suicide, Isaac is contacted by Daina Le Guin, who explains that Isaac's encounter with a Marker has encoded its information into his brain; Sprawl Director Hans Tiedemann has gradually extracted the data to [[reverse-engineer]] a new Marker, drugging Isaac to erase his memory and protect him from [[insanity]] and suicide.\n\nIsaac fights his way through the city to reach Daina, who promises rescue and a cure for his worsening insanity; Isaac finds himself being deterred by violent hallucinations of Nicole Brennan, his deceased girlfriend who insists on becoming \"whole\" with him. Isaac reaches Daina, who has Isaac restrained and reveals she is a Unitologist; Daina explains she's planning to create more Markers to spread \"Convergence\", an event foretold in Unitology. However, an EarthGov gunship strikes their spaceship, killing Daina and her associates and allowing Isaac to escape. Isaac is forced to continue fighting against his violent hallucinations of Nicole.\n\nIsaac is contacted by fellow patient Nolan Stross, who reveals the Marker is located in the Government Sector and claims they can destroy it; left with no choice, Isaac reluctantly teams-up with Stross. Isaac also encounters Ellie Langford, a CEC pilot who lost her crew during the outbreak, and they team up once she agrees to not kill Stross. As they progress, Tidemann shuts off the Sprawl's life-support, forcing Isaac to reactivate it with a [[Solar power|solar]] [[Beam-powered propulsion|array beam]]; Tidemann then takes control of the array to sever the transport tramline to the government sector. Cut off, Isaac is forced to detour through the ''Ishimura'', which is docked at the Sprawl for decontamination and repair after the events of the first game. Stross' dementia soon worsens to the point he attacks Ellie, removing her eye with a screwdriver; pursuing Stross, Isaac is soon forced to kill him in self-defense. With his hallucinations reaching their limit, Isaac admits his guilt over failing to save Nicole, pacifying Nicole.\n\nReaching the Government Sector, Isaac and Ellie repurpose an enormous mining drill to bore an entrance. Tricking Ellie into boarding a ship, Isaac remotely forces it to depart so she can escape. Isaac then releases the Necromorphs onto Tiedemann's forces as a distraction, causing the Government Sector to be overrun; the necromorphs soon reach the Marker, triggering Convergence. With Nicole's help, Isaac guides a needle into his eye, allowing him to recall Marker data and understand how to destroy it. Reaching the Marker, Isaac kills Tiedemann, only to be attacked by Nicole, who invades his mind; \"Nicole\" explains that she simply the Marker's means to manipulate him, and to become \"whole\" is for the Marker absorb the body and mind of its creator. Infuriated and betrayed, Isaac destroys Nicole and the Marker codes in his mind.\n\nAs Titan Station begins to collapse, Ellie returns with the gunship to rescue Isaac, who both safely escape just as the station explodes. In a [[post-credits scene]], an audio transmission is heard between two people: an unknown man and his ranking superior, known only as \"the Overseer\". The subordinate relays that Titan Station, which he calls \"Marker Site 12,\" and its Marker have been destroyed. The Overseer replies that the other sites will have to pick up the pieces.<ref name=\"epilogue\"/>\n\n===''Severed''===\n{{See also|Dead Space: Extraction}}\n\nRunning concurrently with the early parts of '''Dead Space 2''', Severed follows Gabe and Lexine Weller, the former now working for Sprawl Security. Patrolling the Titan Mines as the necromorph outbreak occurs, Gabe is soon one of the few surviving Security members, and contacts Lexine to warn her of the outbreak. Racing to Lexine, Gabe receives a transmission from Director Tiedemann ordering all surviving security teams to scrub the facility and eliminate all key subjects.\n\nExiting Titan Mines, Gabe is fired upon by a gunship containing his superior officer, Victor Bartlett. Using explosives to deter the gunship, Gabe demands a answers from Bartlett, who reveals that subjects in the \"Oracle program\" are included in key targets; due to her pregnancy, Lexine is on the list of targets, so Bartlett attacked him preemptively. Gabe flies to the hospital in a gunship to try and reach Lexine first, before witnessing Victor being disabled by two Unitologists interested in studying Lexine.\n\nGabe chases after the Unitologists to a docked ship, where Lexine escapes into the ship as her kidnappers transform into Necromorphs. Dispatching the threats, Gabe attempts to open the airlock as Lexine prepares the ship. Attempting to hack the airlock, Gabe is ambushed by Victor, who is holding a live grenade; Victor is killed outright, and Gabe is severely injured. Gabe shoots the airlock fuses to open the bay doors, and says goodbye as he succumbs to his wounds. An epilogue reveals Gabe's body has been taken for study, while Lexine's whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Dead Space 2 Original Videogame Score}}\n\nThe game's creative director, Wright Bagwell, said that ''Dead Space'' was very similar to ''[[Resident Evil]]''. \"There's an interesting story from ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'' and ''Dead Space 2'', which is that when we started building ''Dead Space'', we basically started with a mechanic set that was really similar to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.

''[[Game Informer]]'''s Andrew Reiner gave ''Dead Space'' 2 a 9/10, calling it a \"monster of a sequel\". He praised its horror aspect by claiming: \"[b]attling a seven-foot beast that vomits acidic bile and tries to impale Isaac with razor-sharp appendages is one thing, but watching a mother cradle a necromorph baby will haunt my nightmares until I die.\" ''Official Xbox Magazine UK'' gave the game 9 out of 10.<ref name=\"metacritic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dead-space-2|title=Dead Space 2 Metacritic}}</ref> ''GameTrailers'' gave the game 9.0 out of 10, praising the game's dark and dreary atmosphere and its intense and unrelenting gameplay, while pointing out the multiplayer component's shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=12830|title=GameTrailers.com \"Dead Space 2 Review\"}}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s editor Carolyn Petit, who gave the game a score of 8.5 for the Xbox 360 and a 9.0 for the PlayStation 3, said: \"''Dead Space 2'' doesn't bring with it the same sense of experiencing something utterly new and innovative that its predecessor did. But it's nonetheless a terrific game, with a campaign that simultaneously leaves you satisfied and eager for more, and intense multiplayer that gives you a great reason to keep coming back to this terrifying universe. Unless you're just plain chicken, this is a sci-fi horror adventure you definitely want to suit up for.\"\n\n[[IGN]]'s editor Greg Miller gave the game a 9.0, saying that the survival-horror genre got a new gold standard and that: \"''Dead Space 2'' is more than just an action game and it's more than a survival horror game&nbsp;\u2013 it's a game that tells a really personal story about a guy who has been seriously scarred by the events around him. That premise alone makes it interesting, but Visceral Games melds it with rewarding combat, shocking enemies, and huge [[Setpiece|set pieces]] before tossing it into a world that's truly creepy and scary.\" He also said that he did not find the multiplayer very interesting.<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/01/21/dead-space-2-review?page=2</ref>\n\nThierry Nguyen from [[1UP.com]] compared ''Dead Space 2'' and its predecessor to \"Ridley Scott's ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and James Cameron's ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''\". In his review, he says, \"The first installments in both series focus on civilians panicking their way through a dark spaceship while avoiding an extraterrestrial lurking horror; both follow-ups retain their predecessor's basic aesthetic while deliberately shifting from creeping tension into outright sci-fi action. Aliens introduced space marines, the power loader exosuit, and the Alien Queen; Dead Space 2 gives us scenes of Isaac flying around in zero-g, mowing down Necromorphs with an assault rifle while wearing 'space marine' armor, and confidently throwing explosives with his telekinetic powers.\"<ref name=\"1UP.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717054720/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=1UP.com Dead Space 2 Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Fangoria]]'s Doug Norris gave the game 4/4 skulls, praising both the gore and psychological horror.

He also thought that the multiplayer was \"rather unsatisfying and delivers nothing of the pacing and tension that the main game brings.\"\n\nHardcore Gamer's Adam Beck gave ''Dead Space 2'' a 4.5/5, praising the cinematic single-player campaign but criticizing its horror aspect by claiming \"there are just too many expected encounters when you enter a room and it never allows you to let your guard down\".

As in the previous game, the game uses the Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit, an in-world heads-up display ([[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]) system that uses holograms projected from Isaac's suit and weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count. In vacuum areas, a timer appears on Isaac's right shoulder, counting how much oxygen his suit has before he [[Asphyxia|suffocates]]. The RIG also uses gauges on Isaac's back to display his health and stasis module levels. If Isaac's health or air reaches zero, or if the player fails to survive a quick-time event, Isaac will die, forcing the player to restart from the last checkpoint.<ref name=steam_manual>{{cite web|title=Dead Space 2 Manual|url=http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=2 March 2013|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522160511/http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|archivedate=May 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game, Isaac acquires the stasis module, which slows down enemies and otherwise-impassable moving obstacles (e.g. active heavy machinery) to allow Isaac to pass through safely; and the kinesis module, which allows Isaac to carry and fire objects [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. The player can upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using power nodes. There are also [[Automated retail|automated store]]s, where the player can buy and sell various items, and gain new weapons and suits through acquiring schematics found throughout the Sprawl.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nThroughout the game, the player will come across different puzzles that impede progress. In some cases, Isaac must [[hacker (computer security)|hack]] consoles to activate machines and open doors; in others, Isaac must repair or reposition mechanisms to proceed. The player regularly encounters [[Weightlessness|zero-G]] environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering in all directions with [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] attached to his suit. Both normal and zero-G environments may be in areas within the vacuum of outer space; in these situations, Isaac must refill his limited oxygen supply via oxygen dispensers.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nMuch like in the first game, Isaac must fight the Necromorphs, organisms that mutate and take control of human corpses. To take down Necromorphs, the player must use \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\": in other words, slicing off limbs or sections of the Necromorphs' bodies.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Dead Space 2|developer=[[Visceral Games]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=25 January 2011|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|version=1.02-1.1|level=Chapter 2|quote='''Sorenson (audio log)''': Listen up, this is Sorenson from CEC.

Item drops and credits are more rare, enemies are more challenging, and checkpoints are absent.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer in ''Dead Space 2'', also known as Outbreak mode, pits two four-player teams of human Sprawl Security forces and the Necromorphs against each other in different locations and scenarios. The Humans complete various mission objectives before time runs out, such as activating escape pods and destroying machines; whilst the Necromorphs simply prevent the Humans from completing said objectives. There are two rounds per match, with each team switching sides at the end of the round.<ref name=steam_manual /> Human player characters start with two weapons in their arsenal, starting with the standard Pulse Rifle and Plasma Cutter, before unlocking new weapons to use. For Humans, new weapons and improvements are unlocked through level progression, along with different suits similar to the ones in single player for the humans. Necromorph players, on the other hand, unlock boosts to their current abilities, health, and damage. Necromorph players can choose the Necromorph they will spawn as: a Lurker, a Puker, a Spitter, or a member of the Pack. In order to use stronger Necromorphs, like the Puker and Spitter, the player must wait for a number of seconds on the respawn screen before that type is usable. Whilst Sprawl Security players spawn in their main spawn areas, Necromorph players spawn through vents and floor panels all over the map, and can choose their spawn point on the spawn screen.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\n==Plot==\n===Background===\nDuring the 23rd century, Earth's population found themselves suffering resource and energy crises, causing world government EarthGov to begin research on solutions. The former was resolved with \"planet-cracker\" spaceships, created to smash and harvest other planets for resources, and the latter with an investigation of a black alien monolith discovered in the [[Chicxulub crater]], found to a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]]. Dubbed \"The Marker\", the monolith begins causing violent [[psychoses]] in people near to it, prompting lead researcher Michael Altman to try and leak its existence; assassinating Altman too late, EarthGov inadvertent turns him into a [[martyr]], leading to the formation of the Church of Unitology, a cult that uses the marker as a [[Idolatry|religious idol]].\n\nDuring the events of the first game, set in 2508, CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke was a member of the ''USG Kellion'' team sent responded to a distress call of planet-cracker ''USG Ishimura''; Isaac himself joined as the distress signal was sent by his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan. Crashing into the ship due to a malfunction, the ''Ishimura'' was found to be overrun with hostile monsters (dubbed \"necromorphs\"), created from the reanimated, mutated corpses of the crew. Isaac soon learns that the ''Ishimura'' discovered a man-made Red Marker on Aegis VII, its disturbance causing homicidal insanity and the spread of the necromorph infestation. Trying to return the Red Marker to Aegis VII, Isaac is betrayed by ''Kellion'' crew member Kendra Daniels, who intends to steal the marker.\n\nWith the help of Brennan, Isaac returned the marker to the planet, subduing the necromorph Hive-Mind. Isacc then learns from Daniels that Nicole committed suicide; Isaac's interactions with Nicole were [[hallucination]]s caused by the Red Marker. Triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] by returning the Red Marker, Isaac indirectly disables the [[artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the planet together, causing it to begin collapsing. Daniels, removing the marker to try and steal it, reawakens the Hive-Mind, which crushes her to death. Killing the Hive-Mind, Isaac narrowly escapes as the planet implodes, only to be attacked by a hallucination of Brennan.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThree years after the Aegis VII event, Isaac Clarke awakens on the Sprawl, a civilian space-station built onto the remnants of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Isaac wakes amidst a necromorph outbreak, with no memory of the past few years and suffering severe hallucinations. Narrowly escaping as people are murdered and commit suicide, Isaac is contacted by Daina Le Guin, who explains that Isaac's encounter with a Marker has encoded its information into his brain; Sprawl Director Hans Tiedemann has gradually extracted the data to [[reverse-engineer]] a new Marker, drugging Isaac to erase his memory and protect him from [[insanity]] and suicide.\n\nIsaac fights his way through the city to reach Daina, who promises rescue and a cure for his worsening insanity; Isaac finds himself being deterred by violent hallucinations of Nicole Brennan, his deceased girlfriend who insists on becoming \"whole\" with him. Isaac reaches Daina, who has Isaac restrained and reveals she is a Unitologist; Daina explains she's planning to create more Markers to spread \"Convergence\", an event foretold in Unitology. However, an EarthGov gunship strikes their spaceship, killing Daina and her associates and allowing Isaac to escape. Isaac is forced to continue fighting against his violent hallucinations of Nicole.\n\nIsaac is contacted by fellow patient Nolan Stross, who reveals the Marker is located in the Government Sector and claims they can destroy it; left with no choice, Isaac reluctantly teams-up with Stross. Isaac also encounters Ellie Langford, a CEC pilot who lost her crew during the outbreak, and they team up once she agrees to not kill Stross. As they progress, Tidemann shuts off the Sprawl's life-support, forcing Isaac to reactivate it with a [[Solar power|solar]] [[Beam-powered propulsion|array beam]]; Tidemann then takes control of the array to sever the transport tramline to the government sector. Cut off, Isaac is forced to detour through the ''Ishimura'', which is docked at the Sprawl for decontamination and repair after the events of the first game. Stross' dementia soon worsens to the point he attacks Ellie, removing her eye with a screwdriver; pursuing Stross, Isaac is soon forced to kill him in self-defense. With his hallucinations reaching their limit, Isaac admits his guilt over failing to save Nicole, pacifying Nicole.\n\nReaching the Government Sector, Isaac and Ellie repurpose an enormous mining drill to bore an entrance. Tricking Ellie into boarding a ship, Isaac remotely forces it to depart so she can escape. Isaac then releases the Necromorphs onto Tiedemann's forces as a distraction, causing the Government Sector to be overrun; the necromorphs soon reach the Marker, triggering Convergence. With Nicole's help, Isaac guides a needle into his eye, allowing him to recall Marker data and understand how to destroy it. Reaching the Marker, Isaac kills Tiedemann, only to be attacked by Nicole, who invades his mind; \"Nicole\" explains that she simply the Marker's means to manipulate him, and to become \"whole\" is for the Marker absorb the body and mind of its creator. Infuriated and betrayed, Isaac destroys Nicole and the Marker codes in his mind.\n\nAs Titan Station begins to collapse, Ellie returns with the gunship to rescue Isaac, who both safely escape just as the station explodes. In a [[post-credits scene]], an audio transmission is heard between two people: an unknown man and his ranking superior, known only as \"the Overseer\". The subordinate relays that Titan Station, which he calls \"Marker Site 12,\" and its Marker have been destroyed. The Overseer replies that the other sites will have to pick up the pieces.<ref name=\"epilogue\"/>\n\n===''Severed''===\n{{See also|Dead Space: Extraction}}\n\nRunning concurrently with the early parts of '''Dead Space 2''', Severed follows Gabe and Lexine Weller, the former now working for Sprawl Security. Patrolling the Titan Mines as the necromorph outbreak occurs, Gabe is soon one of the few surviving Security members, and contacts Lexine to warn her of the outbreak. Racing to Lexine, Gabe receives a transmission from Director Tiedemann ordering all surviving security teams to scrub the facility and eliminate all key subjects.\n\nExiting Titan Mines, Gabe is fired upon by a gunship containing his superior officer, Victor Bartlett. Using explosives to deter the gunship, Gabe demands a answers from Bartlett, who reveals that subjects in the \"Oracle program\" are included in key targets; due to her pregnancy, Lexine is on the list of targets, so Bartlett attacked him preemptively. Gabe flies to the hospital in a gunship to try and reach Lexine first, before witnessing Victor being disabled by two Unitologists interested in studying Lexine.\n\nGabe chases after the Unitologists to a docked ship, where Lexine escapes into the ship as her kidnappers transform into Necromorphs. Dispatching the threats, Gabe attempts to open the airlock as Lexine prepares the ship. Attempting to hack the airlock, Gabe is ambushed by Victor, who is holding a live grenade; Victor is killed outright, and Gabe is severely injured. Gabe shoots the airlock fuses to open the bay doors, and says goodbye as he succumbs to his wounds. An epilogue reveals Gabe's body has been taken for study, while Lexine's whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Dead Space 2 Original Videogame Score}}\n\nThe game's creative director, Wright Bagwell, said that ''Dead Space'' was very similar to ''[[Resident Evil]]''. \"There's an interesting story from ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'' and ''Dead Space 2'', which is that when we started building ''Dead Space'', we basically started with a mechanic set that was really similar to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.

He praised its horror aspect by claiming: \"[b]attling a seven-foot beast that vomits acidic bile and tries to impale Isaac with razor-sharp appendages is one thing, but watching a mother cradle a necromorph baby will haunt my nightmares until I die.\" ''Official Xbox Magazine UK'' gave the game 9 out of 10.<ref name=\"metacritic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dead-space-2|title=Dead Space 2 Metacritic}}</ref> ''GameTrailers'' gave the game 9.0 out of 10, praising the game's dark and dreary atmosphere and its intense and unrelenting gameplay, while pointing out the multiplayer component's shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=12830|title=GameTrailers.com \"Dead Space 2 Review\"}}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s editor Carolyn Petit, who gave the game a score of 8.5 for the Xbox 360 and a 9.0 for the PlayStation 3, said: \"''Dead Space 2'' doesn't bring with it the same sense of experiencing something utterly new and innovative that its predecessor did. But it's nonetheless a terrific game, with a campaign that simultaneously leaves you satisfied and eager for more, and intense multiplayer that gives you a great reason to keep coming back to this terrifying universe. Unless you're just plain chicken, this is a sci-fi horror adventure you definitely want to suit up for.\"\n\n[[IGN]]'s editor Greg Miller gave the game a 9.0, saying that the survival-horror genre got a new gold standard and that: \"''Dead Space 2'' is more than just an action game and it's more than a survival horror game&nbsp;\u2013 it's a game that tells a really personal story about a guy who has been seriously scarred by the events around him. That premise alone makes it interesting, but Visceral Games melds it with rewarding combat, shocking enemies, and huge [[Setpiece|set pieces]] before tossing it into a world that's truly creepy and scary.\" He also said that he did not find the multiplayer very interesting.<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/01/21/dead-space-2-review?page=2</ref>\n\nThierry Nguyen from [[1UP.com]] compared ''Dead Space 2'' and its predecessor to \"Ridley Scott's ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and James Cameron's ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''\". In his review, he says, \"The first installments in both series focus on civilians panicking their way through a dark spaceship while avoiding an extraterrestrial lurking horror; both follow-ups retain their predecessor's basic aesthetic while deliberately shifting from creeping tension into outright sci-fi action. Aliens introduced space marines, the power loader exosuit, and the Alien Queen; Dead Space 2 gives us scenes of Isaac flying around in zero-g, mowing down Necromorphs with an assault rifle while wearing 'space marine' armor, and confidently throwing explosives with his telekinetic powers.\"<ref name=\"1UP.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717054720/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=1UP.com Dead Space 2 Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Fangoria]]'s Doug Norris gave the game 4/4 skulls, praising both the gore and psychological horror.

He also thought that the multiplayer was \"rather unsatisfying and delivers nothing of the pacing and tension that the main game brings.\"\n\nHardcore Gamer's Adam Beck gave ''Dead Space 2'' a 4.5/5, praising the cinematic single-player campaign but criticizing its horror aspect by claiming \"there are just too many expected encounters when you enter a room and it never allows you to let your guard down\".

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville).

Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton. Orton could not answer the referees 10 count, thus Edge won the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits.

Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the championship.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt, which Wyatt billed as a fight between Cena and Cena's own self. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way.

As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]).

Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton.

In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits.

Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the championship.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt, which Wyatt billed as a fight between Cena and Cena's own self. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] and [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] and [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

The offices of the clinical departments and the full-time clinical faculty members are in this hospital. Since 1995, the expansion program has increased the hospital's bed capacity to a total of 300 beds. The De La Salle University Medical Center includes many [[state-of-the-art]] medical equipment. The hospital also leads other private hospitals in Cavite in setting up medical wards intended for the poor enrolled in the Cavite Governor's health reform program, Dignidad at Kalidad (DK). <ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center |url=https://www.spchcm.com/hospitals/dlsumc |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The DLSUMC Medical Arts Center |url=https://architizer.com/projects/the-dlsumc-medical-arts-center/ |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DLSU Medical Center in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite upgrades facility |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2014/05/19/1324141/dlsu-medical-center-dasmarias-cavite-upgrades-facility |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe De La Salle University Medical Center was initially inaugurated as a 180-bed teaching and training hospital of the then Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine in 1982. In 1987, the De La Salle University system run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools acquired ownership of both the college and hospital. The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda. De Rivera Hall.\n\nIn October 1999 the De La Salle University Medical Center became the first hospital in the Philippines to receive an [[ISO 9001]] Certification and in July 2003 it received a Certification by the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|TUV\u2013Rheinland]] and Berlin\u2013 Brandenburg Group of Companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/dlsumc/about/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Departments and Services===\n*[[Anesthesia]]                        \n*[[Emergency Medicine]]                \n*[[Family medicine|Family and]] [[Community health|Community Medicine]]     \n*[[Internal Medicine]]\n**''[[Allergy]] and [[Immunology]], [[Cardiology]], [[Dermatology]], [[Endocrinology]], [[Gastroenterology]], [[Hematology]], [[Infectious Diseases]],  [[Nephrology]], [[Oncology]], [[Pulmonology]], [[Neurology]], and [[Rheumatology]]''\n*Laboratory Medicine\n**''Hematology, [[Serology]] and Immunology, [[Clinical Chemistry]], [[Microscopy]], [[Microbiology]], [[Blood Transfusion]], [[Surgical pathology|Surgical Pathology]] and [[Cytology]]''\n*[[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]]\n**''[[Perinatology]], OB-Gyne [[Ultrasound]], Trophoblastic Disease, Gynecologic Oncology, Reproductive Endocrinology and [[Infertility]], Infectious Disease, and Gynecologic [[Endoscopy]]''\n*[[Ophthalmology]]                    \n*[[Orthopedics]]\n**''[[Major trauma|Trauma]] Surgery, [[Sports Medicine]] and Arthroscopic Surgery, [[Joint]] Replacement Surgery, [[Shoulder]] Surgery, [[Vertebral column|Spine]] Surgery, Musculoskeletal [[Tumor]] Surgery, Orthopedic Pediatric Surgery, Limb Lengthening and Deformity Correction, [[Foot]] and [[Ankle]] Surgery''\n*[[Otorhinolaryngology]] (ENT)\n**''Head and Neck Surgery, [[Audiology]], [[Otology]], Rhinopharyngology, [[Laryngology]] and Voice Rehabilitation, Bronchoesophagology, Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, Facial Aesthetic Surgery, Newborn Hearing Screening, Hearing and Audiometer Evaluator, and [[Sleep medicine|Sleep Laboratory]]''\n*[[Pediatrics]]\n*[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]\n*[[Psychiatry]]\n*[[Radiology]]\n**''[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Computed tomography|CT-Scan]], [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA Bone Densitometry]], [[Nuclear Medicine]], [[Mammography]], Ultrasonography, C-Arm Machine Scan and General Radiology''\n*[[Surgery]]\n\n==Angelo King Medical Research Center==\n<center>''Hall of Fame, Manuel L.

During the war, the CIA recruited the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] who lived in Laos and they assisted the CIA by disrupting supply routes which stretched from [[Laos]] to [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Vang Pao|General Vang Pao]] was the leader of this army and as a result, he was regarded as a father figure by the Hmong. After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops from Laos in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by the [[Pathet Lao]] in order to \"exterminate the Hmong down to the last root\" in retaliation for their assistance to the United States. Many Hmong were able to relocate to the U.S., however, thousands of them were left behind and killed. Vang and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in [[California]]. Vang lived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and eventually enlisted in the [[California National Guard]].\n\nSometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to the Twin Cities Capital City of [[St. Paul]], neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nVang is the father of seven children.

Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area.  The land in the area is a mix of public and private.  It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private 400 [[acre]] (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) tract of land.\n\nOn Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a [[hunting cabin|cabin]] on this private land.  Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld [[radio]] to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madison.com/news/the-vang-trial-witness-landowner-swore-at-vang/article_a976cb77-d669-5ca9-b451-6df3fb95eb41.html|title=THE VANG TRIAL WITNESS: LANDOWNER SWORE AT VANG|first=ROBERT IMRIE Associated|last=Press|website=madison.com}}</ref> According to Terry Willers' testimony, \"As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off.\" At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck, a surviving victim, stated \"Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on.

Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau \"flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number\".<ref name=ImrieAP>{{cite news|last1=Imrie|first1=Robert|title=Survivor of hunting clash testifies; Jury in Vang trial is told land owner 'was sick' of Hmong trespassers|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11176563.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220194943/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11176563.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 February 2016|accessdate=16 November 2015|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe events after the confrontation are disputed.  A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds. Vang is believed to have fired about 20 rounds from a Saiga rifle chambered in [[7.62\u00d739mm]], which was recovered by police.  One of the wounded hunters died the next day, bringing the toll to six dead and two wounded.\n\nVang fled the scene on foot and discarded his remaining ammunition, later stating that he did not want to shoot anyone else.  Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give Vang a ride, eventually taking him to Vang's cabin.  Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting.  An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail.  His bail was set at $2.5 million.\n\n=== Victims ===\nThe victims were part of a group of about 15 people who made an annual opening-weekend trip to the Crotteau-Willers property.  Among those killed were father and son Robert and Joey Crotteau and Willers' daughter Jessica Willers.\n\nThose who were killed:\n\n* Robert Crotteau, 42\n* Joey Crotteau, 20\n* Alan Laski, 43\n* Mark Roidt, 28\n* Jessica Willers, 27\n* Denny Drew, 55\n\nThose who were wounded:\n* Lauren Hesebeck, 48\n* Terry Willers, 47\n\n== Investigation ==\nThere were conflicting reports about what may have led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shots at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings in retaliation were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun as it was not analysed even though during the trial Hesebeck had admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified that no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. \n\n===Racial motivation===\n\nVang stated that [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] resentment was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as \"[[chink]]\" and \"[[gook]].\" On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a \"Hmong a--hole\" and \"chink\". Hesebeck also claimed that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. He also claimed that the term \"Mud Duck\" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents and in turn the term \"Cheesehead\" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, due to the fact that Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota.\n\nThe criminal complaint states that Vang shot four of the victims in the back, and Vang himself admits he shot one victim in the back. The all-white prosecution made use of these facts in arguing against the claim of self-defense.\n\n== Trial ==\nThe trial of Chai Soua Vang began Saturday, September 10, 2005 in Sawyer County Courthouse.  All fourteen jurors were selected from [[Dane County, Wisconsin]], and bused about {{convert|280|mi|km}} northwest to Sawyer County, where they were sequestered.\n\nVang told the jury he feared for his life and began firing only after another hunter's shot nearly hit him. He detailed for the jurors how the other hunters approached him, and how he responded by shooting at each one.  He says he shot two of the victims in the back because they were \"disrespectful.\" He recounted with clarity how he killed each victim. While saying on the stand, \"(he wished) it wasn't happening,\" Vang contended that three of the hunters deserved to die:\n\n\"Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?\" Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Chai Soua Vang replied.\n\nVang further testified that Joseph Crotteau deserved to die \"because he accused me of giving him the finger and tried to cut in front of me to stop me from leaving.\" And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said.<ref>{{cite news |title= Vang tells his story to Jury |newspaper = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date= 16 September 2005}}</ref> Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the [[language barrier]].

Cha Vang was shot with a shotgun, stabbed six times in the face and neck, and had his corpse hidden in the woods. Before killing Vang, Nichols made statements that Hmong people are \"mean\", \"bad\", and \"go for anything that moves\".

[[Vang Pao|General Vang Pao]] was the leader of this army and was seen as a father figure to the Hmong. After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by Pathet Lao to \"exterminate the Hmong down to the last root\" in retaliation for the Hmong assisting the United States. Many Hmong were able to make it to the U.S. however thousands of the Hmong were left behind and were killed. Vang and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in [[California]].  Vang lived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and eventually enlisted in the [[California National Guard]].\n\nSometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to the Twin Cities Capital City of [[St. Paul]], neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nVang is the father of seven children. He is also a family [[shaman]]<ref>\n{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|title= Hmong Hunter Charged With 6 Murders Is Said to Be a Shaman|last1= Kinzer|first1= Stephen|date= 1 December 2004|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|access-date= 17 December 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160504124052/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|archive-date= 2016-05-04|url-status= live}}\n</ref> and was a hunting enthusiast.\n\n== Shootings ==\nOn the weekend of the shootings, Vang went out deer hunting with two friends and their two sons in northwest [[Wisconsin]], a region where deer hunting is particularly popular, east of [[Birchwood, Wisconsin]] around the town of [[Meteor, Wisconsin|Meteor]]. Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area.  The land in the area is a mix of public and private.  It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private 400 [[acre]] (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) tract of land.\n\nOn Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a [[hunting cabin|cabin]] on this private land.  Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld [[radio]] to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madison.com/news/the-vang-trial-witness-landowner-swore-at-vang/article_a976cb77-d669-5ca9-b451-6df3fb95eb41.html|title=THE VANG TRIAL WITNESS: LANDOWNER SWORE AT VANG|first=ROBERT IMRIE Associated|last=Press|website=madison.com}}</ref> According to Terry Willers' testimony, \"As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off.\" At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck, a surviving victim, stated \"Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on.

Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau \"flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number\".<ref name=ImrieAP>{{cite news|last1=Imrie|first1=Robert|title=Survivor of hunting clash testifies; Jury in Vang trial is told land owner 'was sick' of Hmong trespassers|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11176563.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220194943/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11176563.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 February 2016|accessdate=16 November 2015|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe events after the confrontation are disputed.  A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds. Vang is believed to have fired about 20 rounds from a Saiga rifle chambered in [[7.62\u00d739mm]], which was recovered by police.  One of the wounded hunters died the next day, bringing the toll to six dead and two wounded.\n\nVang fled the scene on foot and discarded his remaining ammunition, later stating that he did not want to shoot anyone else.  Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give Vang a ride, eventually taking him to Vang's cabin.  Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting.  An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail.  His bail was set at $2.5 million.\n\n=== Victims ===\nThe victims were part of a group of about 15 people who made an annual opening-weekend trip to the Crotteau-Willers property.  Among those killed were father and son Robert and Joey Crotteau and Willers' daughter Jessica Willers.\n\nThose who were killed:\n\n* Robert Crotteau, 42\n* Joey Crotteau, 20\n* Alan Laski, 43\n* Mark Roidt, 28\n* Jessica Willers, 27\n* Denny Drew, 55\n\nThose who were wounded:\n* Lauren Hesebeck, 48\n* Terry Willers, 47\n\n== Investigation ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2007}}\nThere have been conflicting reports about what may have led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shot at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun even though during the trial Hesebeck admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot.  Vang stated that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as \"[[chink]]\" and \"[[gook]].\" On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a \"Hmong a--hole.\" Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term \"Mud Duck\" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to \"Cheesehead\" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, due to the fact that Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota.\n\nThe criminal complaint states that Vang shot four of the victims in the back, and Vang himself admits he shot one victim in the back.  He also shot many of the victims multiple times. The prosecution made use of these facts in arguing against the claim of self-defense.\n\n== Trial ==\nThe trial of Chai Soua Vang began Saturday, September 10, 2005 in Sawyer County Courthouse.  All fourteen jurors were selected from [[Dane County, Wisconsin]], and bused about {{convert|280|mi|km}} northwest to Sawyer County, where they were sequestered.\n\nVang told the jury he feared for his life and began firing only after another hunter's shot nearly hit him. He detailed for the jurors how the other hunters approached him, and how he responded by shooting at each one.  He says he shot two of the victims in the back because they were \"disrespectful.\" He recounted with clarity how he killed each victim. While saying on the stand, \"(he wished) it wasn't happening,\" Vang contended that three of the hunters deserved to die:\n\n\"Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?\" Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Chai Soua Vang replied.\n\nVang further testified that Joseph Crotteau deserved to die \"because he accused me of giving him the finger and tried to cut in front of me to stop me from leaving.\" And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said.<ref>{{cite news |title= Vang tells his story to Jury |newspaper = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date= 16 September 2005}}</ref> Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the [[language barrier]]. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski \"deserved to die,\" his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.\n \n=== Conviction ===\nOn September 16, 2005, Chai Soua Vang was found guilty of all six charges of first degree intentional homicide and three charges of attempted homicide by a jury of eight women and four men.
