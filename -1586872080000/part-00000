It is a metropolitan see on the island of [[Mindanao]] which comprises the civil provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Camiguin]] and the municipality of [[Malitbog, Bukidnon]]. Today, it is headed by [[Archbishop]] [[Antonio Ledesma|Antonio J. Ledesma, S.J]] and its seat is located at Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcponline.net/cagayan_de_oro/html/parishes.html|title=Parishes and Parochial Clergy|publisher=Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines}}</ref> in [[Cagayan de Oro City]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Archdiocese of CDO coat of arms 1950.svg|thumb|right|Former Coat of Arms of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro]]\n\nDuring the Spanish era only the Province of Misamis existed, which included the present Provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]] and [[Misamis Occidental]], and was handled by the civil government from [[Cebu]]. The [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Recollect]] Missionaries arrived from Cebu and started a mission in the province. A civil government of its own started only in 1901, and because one part of it was separated from the main by Iligan Bay, the government decided to divide the province into two. [[Misamis Oriental]] is the bigger portion. Today the Diocesan Cathedral is one of the 12 Cathedrals that was founded by the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nBefore 1865, the whole of [[Mindanao]] island and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] were part of the Diocese of Cebu. In 1865 the western half of [[Mindanao]] came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Jaro in Panay. Then [[Pope Leo XIII]] established the [[Diocese of Zamboanga]], separating it from Jaro and making it the first diocese in [[Mindanao]]. But it was [[Pope Pius X]] who executed this in 1910. Thus from 1910 [[Cagayan de Oro City]] became part of the Diocese of Zamboanga.\n\nIt was only after forty-five years, in 1910, that the diocese of Zamboanga was established as the first diocese ever created in the entire island. Then, twenty-five years after in 1933, Pope [[Pius XI]] in a Papal Bull entitled \u201cAd maius religionis\u201d divided Mindanao between the diocese of Zamboanga in the south and a new diocese that of Cagayan de Oro in the north, to which he appointed an American Jesuit, [[James Hayes (archbishop)|James Hayes]], as the first bishop.\n\nThe original territory of the diocese of Cagayan de Oro in 1933 included the provinces of Surigao, Agusan, Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Lanao and the island of Camiguin. A series of divisions however, gradually reduced this territory.\n\nDuring the episcopacy of Bishop Hayes, in 1933, he founded two secondary schools, later raised to colleges \u2013 Lourdes College for Girls (run by the RVM Sisters) and the Ateneo de Cagayan for Boys (run by the Jesuits and raised to University status as Xavier University in 1958).\n\nIt was in the thirteenth year of the Pontificate of Pope Pius XII, on the 29th of June 1951, when the Papal Bull, Quo Phillipina Republica, was decreed in order to serve better and more easily the spiritual needs of the Lord\u2019s flock in the Philippine Republic. The bull contained the Pope\u2019s decision to create new Dioceses and to constitute new Ecclesiastical Provinces in the Philippines. The Dioceses of Lingayen, Caceres, Nueva Segovia, Tuguegarao, Legaspi, Sorsogon, and the Prelature Nullius of Batanes and Babuyanes, as well as the Dioceses Bacolod, Cagayan, Capiz, Jaro or Santa Isabel, Surigao, Zamboanga, and the Prelature Nullius of Cotabato and Sulu, Davao and Ozamis, were withdrawn from the Metropolitan Archbishoprics of Manila and Cebu. From these Dioceses, four new Ecclesiastical Provinces were constituted, namely, Nueva Segovia, Caceres, Jaro, and Cagayan de Oro. The Episcopal seats of these dioceses were elevated to the rank and dignity of Metropolitan Archbishops. Bishop James G. Hayes, S.J., became the Metropolitan Archbishop.\nLater, the Apostolic Prefecture of Sulu, the Prelature Nullius of Marbel, the Prelature Nullius of Tagum, the Diocese of Butuan, the Prelature Nullius of Malaybalay, the Prelature Nullius of Iligan and the Diocese of Tandag became suffragans of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro.\n\nEventually four other archdioceses were established in [[Mindanao]] island: Zamboanga in 1958, Davao in 1970, Cotabato in 1979 and Ozamiz in 1983. Thus there are at present five ecclesiastical provinces in [[Mindanao]].\n\nIn 1952, the first Columban missionaries arrived in Cagayan de Oro as a response to the Archbishop\u2019s invitation because he felt the dearth of priests who would care for his flock. In 1956, in order to respond to the growing number of priests in the diocese, the San Jose de Mindanao Seminary was opened with Fr. Theodore A. Daigler, SJ, as its first rector. In 1958, the Maria Reyna Hospital was opened and directed by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.\n\nAfter long years of service to the people of Cagayan de Oro and with so much effort to put up the foundations of the Archdiocese since his arrival in 1926, Archbishop Hayes, the modest and humble shepherd of Cagayan de Oro for almost half a century, retired in 1971.\n\nOn January 12, 1971, [[Patrick Cronin (archbishop)|Patrick Cronin]],an Irish Columban Missionary, formerly Prelate Ordinary of Ozamis and Iligan was installed as Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cagayan de Oro replacing Archbishop Hayes who had just retired. He continued what Archbishop Hayes had begun. In 1976, through the initiatives of the Archbishop, the House of Friendship located amidst the slum areas of Sto. Nino, Cagayan de Oro City, was opened in order to cater to the needs of the orphans, neglected children, aged, unwed mothers, physically handicapped, refugees, stranded persons, transient indigents, and victims of calamities. At the age of 74 and after serving the people of Cagayan de Oro with utmost love and care, Archbishop Cronin retired due to old age and settled at St. Patrick\u2019s House, Seminary Hill, which he intentionally built as a retirement home and at the same time a home for the aged, sick, and incapacitated diocesan priests of the Archdiocese. To date, priests get together on Mondays for games, meetings, and prayers at St. Patrick\u2019s House.\n\nThe Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, accepted his resignation as Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cagayan de Oro. The resignation took effect on January 5, 1988. [[Jesus Tuquib|Jesus B. Tuquib]], a native from Clarin, Bohol, who had been the Coadjutor Archbishop took over the office and functions of Archbishop Cronin on that day until the year 2006. On the 30th day of May 2006 [[Antonio Ledesma|Antonio J. Ledesma]] was installed as the fourth Archbishop of Cagayan de Oro. Previously, he was Bishop of the Prelature of Ipil in southwestern Mindanao from 1996 to 2006.\n\nThere are 46 diocesan priests manning the 46 parishes within the jurisdiction of the archdiocese, helped by two Jesuit and five Columban priests. Six others are doing non-parochial work and 3 others are in retirement. The rest of the Jesuits are in [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]] or in the major seminary, and the rest of the Columbans, apart from the five involved in parish work, are in their procure house doing various apostolates such as hospital work and other activities. There are 18 [[religious institute]]s of women, one of which is a contemplative institute, the Carmelite nuns.\n\nThe archdiocese has its own diocesan college seminary, the San Jose de Mindanao Seminary that opened in 1955. It was constructed by Archbishop Hayes, was first administered by the Jesuits, then by Columban priests, and now by the diocesan clergy.\n\n[[File:Archdiocese of CDO coat of arms new 2.svg|thumb|right|Current arms of the archdiocese, correct version with the archbishop's mitre]]\n\nAlso within the archdiocese is a theology seminary - the [[St. John Vianney]] Theological Seminary, which is mainly for seminarians of the Ecclesiastical [[Metro Cagayan de Oro]]. This was started by Archbishop Cronin and finished by Archbishop Tuquib. It opened in 1985.\n\n== Suffragan dioceses ==\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Butuan|Diocese of Butuan]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Malaybalay|Diocese of Malaybalay]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Surigao|Diocese of Surigao]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tandag|Diocese of Tandag]]\n\n== Ordinaries ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! colspan=2 |Archbishop!!

Most of them are in the parishes but there are also others without a parish, either in the seminary or carrying out diocesan or apostolate tasks. Some are outside the archdiocese either on study-leave, on mission, working in other dioceses, or on leave from the ministry, and some are retired.\n\nMost of the diocesan priests have become members of a society of diocesan priests founded by Bishop [[Teofilo Camomot]]: the Society of St. John Vianney (SSJV). Some religious priests who are now taking care of 3 parishes help the priests in the parishes.\n\n{{As of|2013}} there were 9 male religious congregations in the archdiocese:\n*[[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament]] (SSS)\n*[[Stigmatines|Congregation of the Sacred Stigmata of Our Lord Jesus Christ]] (CSS)\n*[[Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate]] (FFI)\n*[[Missionary Society of St. Columban]] (SSC)\n*Mission Society of the Philippines (MSP)\n*[[Poor Servants of Divine Providence]] (PSDP)\n*[[Priests of the Sacred Heart|Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] (SCJ)\n*[[Society of Jesus]] (SJ)\n*[[Society of Saint Paul]] (SSP)\n\n== Institute of Consecrates Life For Women ==\n{{As of|2013}} there were in the archdiocese, one institute of contemplative life (Carmelite nuns), and 17 [[religious institute]]s of active life:\n*[[Angelic Sisters of St. Paul]] (ASSP)\n*Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady (OSA)\n*[[Canossians|Canossian Daughters of Charity]] (FDCC)\n*[[Carmelites|Carmelite Missionaries]] (CM)\n*Order of the Company of Mary Our Lady (ODN)\n*[[Daughters of St. Paul]] (FSP)\n*[[Franciscan Missionaries of Mary]] (FMM)\n*[[Congregation of the Hijas de Jes\u00fas|Hijas de Jesus]] (FI)\n*Missionary Congregation of Mary (MCM)\n*[[Discalced Carmelites|Order of the Discalced Carmelite]] (OCD)\n*Our Lady\u2019s Missionaries (OLM)\n*[[Religious of the Assumption]] (RA)\n*Religious of the Good Shepherd (RGS)\n*[[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] (RSM)\n*[[Religious of the Virgin Mary]] (RVM)\n*[[Siervas de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora dela Paz]] (SNSP)\n*[[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres]] (SPC)\n*Ursuline Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (UMSH)\n\n==Pious Associations==\nThese are the groups of women on the way of becoming religious institutes of diocesan right:\n*Missionary Sisters of the Holy Family (MSHF)\n*Theresian Missionary of Mary (TMM)\n*Sisters of Social Apostolate (SSA)\n\nThe MSHF and the TMM are outgrowths of the original group founded by Archbishop [[Teofilo Camomot]] and brought by him to [[Cagayan de Oro City]]: the Daughters of St. Teresa or DST, which later moved to [[Cebu]].  The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary or FMM used to have a house here.  And there is one lay association, the Teresiana.\n\nThe religious sisters are in various fields of apostolate (like running or administering schools, campus ministry, parish work, catechetics, family life, hospital work, running orphanages, taking care of young ladies, and others).\n\n== Seminaries ==\nThere are two seminaries in the archdiocese: a college seminary and a theology seminary.\n\nThe college seminary, named, '''San Jose de Mindanao Seminary''', is mainly for the seminarians of the archdiocese, although it continues to receive seminarians from other ecclesiastical jurisdictions. It has a pre-college year and four years of college.  The seminarians used to study within the seminary but due to lack of personnel and other reasons, they now take their courses in [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], which is owned and run by the Jesuit Fathers.  This college seminary was founded by Archbishop Hayes and opened in 1956.\n\n'''St. John Vianney Theological Seminary''' caters mainly to the seminarians of the Ecclesiastical [[Metro Cagayan de Oro]], although it also accepts seminarians from other ecclesiastical jurisdictions.  It has a Spiritual Pastoral Formation Year and four years of Theology. In consortium with [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], it now offers a master's degree in Pastoral Theology.  It is run mainly by the Jesuit Fathers though there are now many diocesan priests teaching in the seminary.  The construction of the seminary was begun by Archbishop Cronin and finished by Archbishop Tuquib.\n\nThe Archdiocese's seminaries have to refuse entry to many applicants due to lack of space.\n\nWhile older priests are products of either the UST Central Seminary (Manila), San Jose Seminary (Manila), [[San Carlos Seminary]] (Makati), or REMASE (Davao), most of the younger clergy were educated at St. John Vianney Theological Seminary.\n\n== Lay religious organizations, movements, and covenant communities ==\nWhile the archdiocese has many and varied traditional lay organizations, such as the [[Knights of Columbus]], [[Catholic Women's League]], [[Legion of Mary]], [[Apostleship of Prayer]], [[Cursillo|Cursillos de Cristiandad]], and many others, it also has many lay groups and what they call now the covenant communities.  Thus, they have, for example, the [[Christian Family Movement]], the [[Charismatic Movement]] (in all its many expressions and forms), the [[Neocatechumenal Way]], the many so-called covenant communities, like the [[Couples for Christ]] and its many outreaches to widows and children, the Kahayag sa Dios (also with its many outreaches), the World Apostolate of Fatima\u2014A Public International Association of the Faithful of Pontifical Right\u2014Cagayan de Oro Archdiocesan Division where one of its apostolic work is the formation of the Block Rosary Apostolate for Community Evangelization. The mission of the World Apostolate of Fatima is the \"New Evangelization\" advocated by Pope John Paul II, through the promotion of the Message of Fatima.\n\n== University, colleges and schools ==\nThere is one Catholic university ([[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], run by the Jesuits), and six colleges ([[Lourdes College (Cagayan de Oro)|Lourdes College]], St. Rita\u2019s, [[Christ the King College, Gingoog City|Christ the King]], and [[St. Mary's Academy of Carmen|St. Mary\u2019s]], run by the RVM Sisters; and Fatima College in [[Mambajao]], run by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]]). Most of the Catholic educational institutions were either founded by Archbishop Hayes himself or founded during his time.\n\nThere are 18 catholic high schools, most of which are run by Sisters. A group of Sisters, the [[Congregation of the Hijas de Jes\u00fas|Hijas de Jesus]], administers the only Chinese Catholic school in Cagayan de Oro, the Kong Hua School (now under the Lorenzo Ruiz Mission Society)\n\n== Retreat centers ==\n{{As of|2013}}  there were five retreat centers or houses where people can go for recollections, days of prayer or solitude, or retreats.  The latest of these is the Cardinal Hoffner\u2019s House of Prayer owned by the archdiocese.\n\n== Hospitals and rehabilitation centers ==\nFor physically, psychologically, psychiatrically or emotionally sick people, the archdiocese has: one hospital (Maria Reyna Xavier University Hospital, founded by Archbishop Hayes and currently owned by a partnership between the archdiocese, the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres]], and [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xu.edu.ph/index.php/component/content/article/1-latest-news/465-xmruh-launches-new-er-or-complex|title= XMRUH launches new ER-OR complex|publisher=XU Website|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> and four rehabilitation centers, the best-known of which is the House of Hope of the archdiocese for the mentally sick.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cagayan de Oro City]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.rcacdo.com/}}\n* [http://www.cbcponline.net/cagayan_de_oro/ Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro-CBCP]\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcado.html Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro-Catholic Hierarchy]\n* [http://www.cbcponline.net Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]\n\n{{Roman Catholic dioceses in the Philippines}}\n\n{{coord|8.4749|N|124.6410|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cagayan}}\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1933]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in the Philippines|Cagayan de Oro]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses and prelatures established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Cagayan de Oro|Archdiocese]]\n[[Category:1933 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Religion in Misamis Oriental]]\n[[Category:Cagayan de Oro]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Roman Catholic Archdiocese|the cathedral|Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral}}\n\n{{Infobox diocese\n| jurisdiction      = Archdiocese<!-- Type of jurisdiction: i.e. Diocese or Archdiocese -->\n| name              = Cagayan de Oro\n| latin             = Archidioecesis Cagayana\n| local             = Arkidyosesis sa Cagayan de Oro <br /><small>Arquidi\u00f3cesis de Cagay\u00e1n de Oro</small>\n| image             = San Agustin Cathderal in Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental.jpg\n| image_size        = 250px \n| image_alt         = \n| caption           = Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral, Seat of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro\n| coat              = File:Archdiocese of CDO coat of arms new.svg\n| coat_caption      = Coat of arms of the archdiocese, with the archbishop's galero (incorrect)\n<!---- Locations ---->\n| country           = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| province          = Cagayan de Oro\n| deaneries         = 6\n| territory         = [[Cagayan de Oro City]], [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Camiguin]], and Malitbog, Bukidnon\n| coordinates       = <!-- Use {{coord}} --> \n<!---- Statistics ---->\n| area_km2          = 3,799 \n| population        = 1,435,098\n| population_as_of  = 2016\n| catholics         = 1,075,773\n| catholics_percent = 75.0\n| parishes          = 62\n| congregations     = \n| churches          = <!-- Number of churches in the diocese -->\n| schools           = <!-- Number of church supported schools in the diocese -->\n| members           = <!-- Number of members in the diocese -->\n<!---- Information ---->\n| denomination      = [[Roman Catholic]]\n| sui_iuris_church  = [[Latin Church]]\n| rite              = [[Roman Rite]]\n| established       = January 20, 1933 <small>(as diocese)</small><br>June 29, 1951 <small>(as archdiocese)</small>\n| cathedral         = [[Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n| cocathedral       = \n| patron            = [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]]\n| priests           = <!-- Number of priests in the diocese -->109\n<!---- Current leadership ---->\n| pope              = {{Incumbent pope}} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE.

It is a metropolitan see on the island of [[Mindanao]] which comprises the civil provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Camiguin]] and the municipality of [[Malitbog, Bukidnon]]. Today, it is headed by [[Archbishop]] [[Antonio Ledesma|Antonio J. Ledesma, S.J]] and its seat is located at Saint Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcponline.net/cagayan_de_oro/html/parishes.html|title=Parishes and Parochial Clergy|publisher=Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines}}</ref> in [[Cagayan de Oro City]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Archdiocese of CDO coat of arms 1950.svg|thumb|right|Former Coat of Arms of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro]]\n\nDuring the Spanish era only the Province of Misamis existed, which included the present Provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]] and [[Misamis Occidental]], and was handled by the civil government from [[Cebu]]. The [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Recollect]] Missionaries arrived from Cebu and started a mission in the province. A civil government of its own started only in 1901, and because one part of it was separated from the main by Iligan Bay, the government decided to divide the province into two. [[Misamis Oriental]] is the bigger portion. Today the Diocesan Cathedral is one of the 12 Cathedrals that was founded by the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nBefore 1865, the whole of [[Mindanao]] island and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] were part of the Diocese of Cebu. In 1865 the western half of [[Mindanao]] came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Jaro in Panay. Then [[Pope Leo XIII]] established the [[Diocese of Zamboanga]], separating it from Jaro and making it the first diocese in [[Mindanao]]. But it was [[Pope Pius X]] who executed this in 1910. Thus from 1910 [[Cagayan de Oro City]] became part of the Diocese of Zamboanga.\n\nIt was only after forty-five years, in 1910, that the diocese of Zamboanga was established as the first diocese ever created in the entire island. Then, twenty-five years after in 1933, Pope [[Pius XI]] in a Papal Bull entitled \u201cAd maius religionis\u201d divided Mindanao between the diocese of Zamboanga in the south and a new diocese that of Cagayan de Oro in the north, to which he appointed an American Jesuit, [[James Hayes (archbishop)|James Hayes]], as the first bishop.\n\nThe original territory of the diocese of Cagayan de Oro in 1933 included the provinces of Surigao, Agusan, Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Lanao and the island of Camiguin. A series of divisions however, gradually reduced this territory.\n\nDuring the episcopacy of Bishop Hayes, in 1933, he founded two secondary schools, later raised to colleges \u2013 Lourdes College for Girls (run by the RVM Sisters) and the Ateneo de Cagayan for Boys (run by the Jesuits and raised to University status as Xavier University in 1958).\n\nIt was in the thirteenth year of the Pontificate of Pope Pius XII, on the 29th of June 1951, when the Papal Bull, Quo Phillipina Republica, was decreed in order to serve better and more easily the spiritual needs of the Lord\u2019s flock in the Philippine Republic. The bull contained the Pope\u2019s decision to create new Dioceses and to constitute new Ecclesiastical Provinces in the Philippines. The Dioceses of Lingayen, Caceres, Nueva Segovia, Tuguegarao, Legaspi, Sorsogon, and the Prelature Nullius of Batanes and Babuyanes, as well as the Dioceses Bacolod, Cagayan, Capiz, Jaro or Santa Isabel, Surigao, Zamboanga, and the Prelature Nullius of Cotabato and Sulu, Davao and Ozamis, were withdrawn from the Metropolitan Archbishoprics of Manila and Cebu. From these Dioceses, four new Ecclesiastical Provinces were constituted, namely, Nueva Segovia, Caceres, Jaro, and Cagayan de Oro. The Episcopal seats of these dioceses were elevated to the rank and dignity of Metropolitan Archbishops. Bishop James G. Hayes, S.J., became the Metropolitan Archbishop.\nLater, the Apostolic Prefecture of Sulu, the Prelature Nullius of Marbel, the Prelature Nullius of Tagum, the Diocese of Butuan, the Prelature Nullius of Malaybalay, the Prelature Nullius of Iligan and the Diocese of Tandag became suffragans of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro.\n\nEventually four other archdioceses were established in [[Mindanao]] island: Zamboanga in 1958, Davao in 1970, Cotabato in 1979 and Ozamiz in 1983. Thus there are at present five ecclesiastical provinces in [[Mindanao]].\n\nIn 1952, the first Columban missionaries arrived in Cagayan de Oro as a response to the Archbishop\u2019s invitation because he felt the dearth of priests who would care for his flock. In 1956, in order to respond to the growing number of priests in the diocese, the San Jose de Mindanao Seminary was opened with Fr. Theodore A. Daigler, SJ, as its first rector. In 1958, the Maria Reyna Hospital was opened and directed by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.\n\nAfter long years of service to the people of Cagayan de Oro and with so much effort to put up the foundations of the Archdiocese since his arrival in 1926, Archbishop Hayes, the modest and humble shepherd of Cagayan de Oro for almost half a century, retired in 1971.\n\nOn January 12, 1971, [[Patrick Cronin (archbishop)|Patrick Cronin]],an Irish Columban Missionary, formerly Prelate Ordinary of Ozamis and Iligan was installed as Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cagayan de Oro replacing Archbishop Hayes who had just retired. He continued what Archbishop Hayes had begun. In 1976, through the initiatives of the Archbishop, the House of Friendship located amidst the slum areas of Sto. Nino, Cagayan de Oro City, was opened in order to cater to the needs of the orphans, neglected children, aged, unwed mothers, physically handicapped, refugees, stranded persons, transient indigents, and victims of calamities. At the age of 74 and after serving the people of Cagayan de Oro with utmost love and care, Archbishop Cronin retired due to old age and settled at St. Patrick\u2019s House, Seminary Hill, which he intentionally built as a retirement home and at the same time a home for the aged, sick, and incapacitated diocesan priests of the Archdiocese. To date, priests get together on Mondays for games, meetings, and prayers at St. Patrick\u2019s House.\n\nThe Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, accepted his resignation as Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cagayan de Oro. The resignation took effect on January 5, 1988. [[Jesus Tuquib|Jesus B. Tuquib]], a native from Clarin, Bohol, who had been the Coadjutor Archbishop took over the office and functions of Archbishop Cronin on that day until the year 2006. On the 30th day of May 2006 [[Antonio Ledesma|Antonio J. Ledesma]] was installed as the fourth Archbishop of Cagayan de Oro. Previously, he was Bishop of the Prelature of Ipil in southwestern Mindanao from 1996 to 2006.\n\nThere are 46 diocesan priests manning the 46 parishes within the jurisdiction of the archdiocese, helped by two Jesuit and five Columban priests. Six others are doing non-parochial work and 3 others are in retirement. The rest of the Jesuits are in [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]] or in the major seminary, and the rest of the Columbans, apart from the five involved in parish work, are in their procure house doing various apostolates such as hospital work and other activities. There are 18 [[religious institute]]s of women, one of which is a contemplative institute, the Carmelite nuns.\n\nThe archdiocese has its own diocesan college seminary, the San Jose de Mindanao Seminary that opened in 1955. It was constructed by Archbishop Hayes, was first administered by the Jesuits, then by Columban priests, and now by the diocesan clergy.\n\n[[File:Archdiocese of CDO coat of arms new 2.svg|thumb|right|Current arms of the archdiocese, correct version with the archbishop's mitre]]\n\nAlso within the archdiocese is a theology seminary - the [[St. John Vianney]] Theological Seminary, which is mainly for seminarians of the Ecclesiastical [[Metro Cagayan de Oro]]. This was started by Archbishop Cronin and finished by Archbishop Tuquib. It opened in 1985.\n\n== Suffragan dioceses ==\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Butuan|Diocese of Butuan]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Malaybalay|Diocese of Malaybalay]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Surigao|Diocese of Surigao]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tandag|Diocese of Tandag]]\n\n== Ordinaries ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! colspan=2 |Archbishop!!

Most of them are in the parishes but there are also others without a parish, either in the seminary or carrying out diocesan or apostolate tasks. Some are outside the archdiocese either on study-leave, on mission, working in other dioceses, or on leave from the ministry, and some are retired.\n\nMost of the diocesan priests have become members of a society of diocesan priests founded by Bishop [[Teofilo Camomot]]: the Society of St. John Vianney (SSJV). Some religious priests who are now taking care of 3 parishes help the priests in the parishes.\n\n{{As of|2013}} there were 9 male religious congregations in the archdiocese:\n*[[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament]] (SSS)\n*[[Stigmatines|Congregation of the Sacred Stigmata of Our Lord Jesus Christ]] (CSS)\n*[[Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate]] (FFI)\n*[[Missionary Society of St. Columban]] (SSC)\n*Mission Society of the Philippines (MSP)\n*[[Poor Servants of Divine Providence]] (PSDP)\n*[[Priests of the Sacred Heart|Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] (SCJ)\n*[[Society of Jesus]] (SJ)\n*[[Society of Saint Paul]] (SSP)\n\n== Institute of Consecrates Life For Women ==\n{{As of|2013}} there were in the archdiocese, one institute of contemplative life (Carmelite nuns), and 17 [[religious institute]]s of active life:\n*[[Angelic Sisters of St. Paul]] (ASSP)\n*Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady (OSA)\n*[[Canossians|Canossian Daughters of Charity]] (FDCC)\n*[[Carmelites|Carmelite Missionaries]] (CM)\n*Order of the Company of Mary Our Lady (ODN)\n*[[Daughters of St. Paul]] (FSP)\n*[[Franciscan Missionaries of Mary]] (FMM)\n*[[Congregation of the Hijas de Jes\u00fas|Hijas de Jesus]] (FI)\n*Missionary Congregation of Mary (MCM)\n*[[Discalced Carmelites|Order of the Discalced Carmelite]] (OCD)\n*Our Lady\u2019s Missionaries (OLM)\n*[[Religious of the Assumption]] (RA)\n*Religious of the Good Shepherd (RGS)\n*[[Religious Sisters of Mercy]] (RSM)\n*[[Religious of the Virgin Mary]] (RVM)\n*[[Siervas de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora dela Paz]] (SNSP)\n*[[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres]] (SPC)\n*Ursuline Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (UMSH)\n\n==Pious Associations==\nThese are the groups of women on the way of becoming religious institutes of diocesan right:\n*Missionary Sisters of the Holy Family (MSHF)\n*Theresian Missionary of Mary (TMM)\n*Sisters of Social Apostolate (SSA)\n\nThe MSHF and the TMM are outgrowths of the original group founded by Archbishop [[Teofilo Camomot]] and brought by him to [[Cagayan de Oro City]]: the Daughters of St. Teresa or DST, which later moved to [[Cebu]].  The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary or FMM used to have a house here.  And there is one lay association, the Teresiana.\n\nThe religious sisters are in various fields of apostolate (like running or administering schools, campus ministry, parish work, catechetics, family life, hospital work, running orphanages, taking care of young ladies, and others).\n\n== Seminaries ==\nThere are two seminaries in the archdiocese: a college seminary and a theology seminary.\n\nThe college seminary, named, '''San Jose de Mindanao Seminary''', is mainly for the seminarians of the archdiocese, although it continues to receive seminarians from other ecclesiastical jurisdictions. It has a pre-college year and four years of college.  The seminarians used to study within the seminary but due to lack of personnel and other reasons, they now take their courses in [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], which is owned and run by the Jesuit Fathers.  This college seminary was founded by Archbishop Hayes and opened in 1956.\n\n'''St. John Vianney Theological Seminary''' caters mainly to the seminarians of the Ecclesiastical [[Metro Cagayan de Oro]], although it also accepts seminarians from other ecclesiastical jurisdictions.  It has a Spiritual Pastoral Formation Year and four years of Theology. In consortium with [[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], it now offers a master's degree in Pastoral Theology.  It is run mainly by the Jesuit Fathers though there are now many diocesan priests teaching in the seminary.  The construction of the seminary was begun by Archbishop Cronin and finished by Archbishop Tuquib.\n\nThe Archdiocese's seminaries have to refuse entry to many applicants due to lack of space.\n\nWhile older priests are products of either the UST Central Seminary (Manila), San Jose Seminary (Manila), [[San Carlos Seminary]] (Makati), or REMASE (Davao), most of the younger clergy were educated at St. John Vianney Theological Seminary.\n\n== Lay religious organizations, movements, and covenant communities ==\nWhile the archdiocese has many and varied traditional lay organizations, such as the [[Knights of Columbus]], [[Catholic Women's League]], [[Legion of Mary]], [[Apostleship of Prayer]], [[Cursillo|Cursillos de Cristiandad]], and many others, it also has many lay groups and what they call now the covenant communities.  Thus, they have, for example, the [[Christian Family Movement]], the [[Charismatic Movement]] (in all its many expressions and forms), the [[Neocatechumenal Way]], the many so-called covenant communities, like the [[Couples for Christ]] and its many outreaches to widows and children, the Kahayag sa Dios (also with its many outreaches), the World Apostolate of Fatima\u2014A Public International Association of the Faithful of Pontifical Right\u2014Cagayan de Oro Archdiocesan Division where one of its apostolic work is the formation of the Block Rosary Apostolate for Community Evangelization. The mission of the World Apostolate of Fatima is the \"New Evangelization\" advocated by Pope John Paul II, through the promotion of the Message of Fatima.\n\n== University, colleges and schools ==\nThere is one Catholic university ([[Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan]], run by the Jesuits), and six colleges ([[Lourdes College (Cagayan de Oro)|Lourdes College]], St. Rita\u2019s, [[Christ the King College, Gingoog City|Christ the King]], and [[St. Mary's Academy of Carmen|St. Mary\u2019s]], run by the RVM Sisters; and Fatima College in [[Mambajao]], run by the [[Religious Sisters of Mercy]]). Most of the Catholic educational institutions were either founded by Archbishop Hayes himself or founded during his time.\n\nThere are 18 catholic high schools, most of which are run by Sisters.
