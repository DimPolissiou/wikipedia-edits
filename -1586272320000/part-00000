As years rolled on, Lokomotiv held several important matches such as [[Russia National Football Team|Russian National team]] home matches, Lokomotiv matches and others. The stadium also played host to a European Cup Qualifier between [[FC Spartak Moscow]] and [[Swiss]] club [[FC Sion]]. The match finished 2-2; however, the Swiss club then forced UEFA to measure the posts for compliance with international standards. Indeed, the size of the posts were shown to infringe international standards. Eventually, UEFA ordered a replay, which [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]] won 5-1.\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nDespite the fact that Lokomotiv Stadium was still of good quality, the [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] board felt that a new stadium would be the best option. The construction was backed by the Russian Transport Ministry. The new stadium held its first match on July 5, 2002 when [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] welcomed [[FC Uralan Elista|Uralan Elista]]. The home team won 1-0 and the first official goal scored at the new stadium was an own goal by [[Dmitry Semochko]].\n\nOn 5 August 2017, [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]] announced that the stadium has been renamed to '''RZD Arena''' following a deal with [[Russian Railways]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fclm.ru/ru/publications/news/15968|title=\u0417\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0424\u041a \u00ab\u041b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u00bb - \u0424\u041a \u041b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432|website=Fclm.ru|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:LOKOSTADIUMPLAN.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stadium Plan]]\n'''Lokomotiv''' was designed solely for football matches and thus has no running tracks. The pitch, which is 104mx68m, is surrounded by two-tiered four all-seater stands, the North Stand, the South Stand, the East Stand and the West Stand. The South Stand is home to the Lokomotiv Moscow ultras. On the other hand, travelling fans generally reside in the North Stand. All the stands are covered by a roof, by thus protecting the fans from the Russian harsh weather elements. The total areas of the glass roof is 20,000 square metres. A unique characteristic of the stadium are the VIP-Boxes found in between the upper and lower tiers of all the stands, with one of them being even a restaurant. Furthermore, the stadium comprises other three VIP-sectors, one of them being of soft-seats. Altogether they total to 974 VIP-seats. Furthermore, there are 156 seats available for the press. Thus in all the stadium holds 30,000 people.
