However, two weekend scores of 73 gave him a T4 finish. During the remainder of the 2010 season, Mickelson had multiple opportunities to become the number one player in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|world rankings]] following the travails of Tiger Woods. However, a string of disappointing finishes by Mickelson saw the number one spot eventually go to Englishman [[Lee Westwood]].\n\nIn the days leading up to the [[2010 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Whistling Straits]] (near [[Kohler, Wisconsin]]), Mickelson announced he had been diagnosed with [[psoriatic arthritis]]. He added that he had started medical treatment, and had become a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] in hopes of aiding his recovery. He maintains that both his short- and long-term prognosis are good, that the condition should have no long-term effect on his golfing career, and that he currently feels well. He also stated that the arthritis may go into permanent remission after one year of medical treatment. He went on to finish the championship T12, five shots behind winner [[Martin Kaymer]].\n\n===2011===\nMickelson started his [[2011 PGA Tour|2011]] season at the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] at [[Torrey Pines Golf Course]]. He shot {{nowrap|67-69-68}} and was tied for the 54 hole lead with [[Bill Haas]]. Mickelson needed to hole out on the 18th hole for eagle from 74 yards to force a playoff with [[Bubba Watson]]. He hit it to 4 feet and Watson won the tournament.\n\nOn April 3, Mickelson won the [[Shell Houston Open]] with a 20-under-par, three-stroke win over [[Scott Verplank]]. Mickelson rose to No. 3 in the world ranking, while [[Tiger Woods]] fell to No. 7. Mickelson had not been ranked above Woods since the week prior to the [[1997 Masters Tournament]].\n\nAt [[2011 Open Championship|The Open Championship]], Mickelson recorded just his second top-ten finish in 18 tournaments by tying for second with [[Dustin Johnson]].

He fought to make the cut in the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and finished T-65th. After taking a couple of weeks off, he played in the [[Greenbrier Classic]]. Putting problems meant a second straight missed cut at the Greenbrier and a third missed cut at [[The Open Championship|2012 Open Championship]], shooting 73-78 (11 over par).

Mickelson endured a disappointing tournament, finishing T51, shooting all four rounds in the 70s.\n\nIn the first round of the Waste Management [[Phoenix Open]], Mickelson tied his career low round of 60. He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed a birdie on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole lipped out, resulting in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four shot win over [[Brandt Snedeker]] for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title.

He regained the lead at the par four 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader [[Justin Rose]]. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.\n\nMickelson ended up finishing tied for second with [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]], two strokes behind Justin Rose.

He failed to contend at the [[2014 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam. Mickelson's lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year's final major, the [[2014 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Valhalla Golf Club|Valhalla]]. Mickelson shot rounds of 69-67-67-66 to finish solo second, one shot behind world number one [[Rory McIlroy]].\n\nPrior to the [[2015 Masters Tournament|2015 Masters]], Mickelson's best finish in [[2015 PGA Tour|2015]] was a tie for 17th. At the Masters, Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|70-68-67-69}} to finish tied for second with [[Justin Rose]], four shots behind champion [[Jordan Spieth]]. The second-place finish was Mickelson's tenth such finish in a major, placing him second all time only to [[Jack Nicklaus]] in that regard.\n\nAt [[2015 Open Championship|The Open Championship]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|70-72-70}} and was eight shots behind, outside the top forty. In the final round, Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} birdie putt on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous Road Hole (17th) at the famed [[Old Course at St Andrews]] onto a second floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out of bounds drive lead to a triple bogey 7 that sent Mickelson tumbling out of contention.\n\nLater in the year, it was announced that Mickelson would leave longtime swing coach Butch Harmon, feeling as though he needed to hear a new perspective on things.\n\n===2016: New swing coach===\nAfter leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach. The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\nUnder Getson's guidance, Mickelson made his [[2016 PGA Tour|2016]] debut at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]]. He shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-68}} to finish in a tie for third place at 21-under-par. It was only Mickelson's fifth top-five finish since his win at the 2013 Open Championship. The third-place finish was Mickelson's highest finish in his first worldwide start of a calendar year since he won the same event to begin the 2004 season.\n\nAt the [[AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-72}} to finish in solo second place, a shot behind [[Vaughn Taylor]]. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot birdie putt to force a playoff on the 72nd hole. He entered the final round with a two stroke lead, his first 54-hole lead since the 2013 U.S. Open and was seeking to end a winless drought dating back 52 worldwide events to the 2013 Open Championship.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-falls-agonisingly-short-at-pebble |title=Phil Mickelson falls agonisingly short at Pebble |date=February 15, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref>\n\nMickelson shot a 63 in the opening round of [[2016 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] at [[Royal Troon Golf Club|Royal Troon]].

Despite Mickelson's bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner up. Mickelson's 267 total set a record score for a runner up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson's 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner up in major championship history.\n\n===2017: Recovery from surgeries===\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]] was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would've got him to 8-under par instead posting \u22127 {{nowrap|(71-72-67-71)}} to finish T14 at the [[Farmers Insurance Open]]. The following week, at the Waste Management [[Phoenix Open]], which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65. He played his first nine holes in 4-under 32 and sending his name to the top of the leaderboard. However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole. He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.\n\nMickelson came close to winning again at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] where he had finished in second place the previous year to [[Daniel Berger (golfer)|Daniel Berger]]. He started the final round four strokes behind leaders but he quickly played himself into contention. Following a birdie at the 10th hole he vaulted to the top of leaderboard but found trouble on the 12th hole. His tee shot carried out of bounds and his fourth shot hit the water so he had to make a long putt to salvage triple-bogey. He managed to get one shot back but he finished three shots behind winner Berger, in ninth place, for the second straight year.\n\nTwo weeks later he withdrew from the U.S. Open to attend his daughter's high school graduation. A week later his longtime caddie Jim (Bones) Mackay left Mickelson in a mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-and-caddie-bones-part-ways |title=Phil Mickelson and caddie Bones part ways |date=June 20, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> Mickelson then missed the cut at both [[2017 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] and the [[2017 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], shooting one of his worst rounds in a major.\n\nOn September 6, days after posting his best finish of the season of T6 at the [[Dell Technologies Championship]], Mickelson was named as a captain's pick for the [[2017 Presidents Cup|Presidents Cup]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-gets-captains-pick-for-presidents-cup |title=Phil Mickelson gets captain's pick for Presidents Cup |date=September 7, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> This maintained a streak of 23 consecutive USA teams in the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, dating back to 1994.\n\n===2018: Winless streak ends===\nOn March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the [[2018 WGC-Mexico Championship|WGC-Mexico Championship]], with a final round score of 66 and a total score of \u221216.

The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than {{convert|50|yd}}.

Mickelson had a poor start to his fourth round, scoring a triple-bogey when he hit his ball far to the left of the green on the par-3 4th hole, hitting the stand and landing in a bamboo plant. This ended up being Mickelson's only score over par in the whole round, and he ended with a score of eight-under overall.

He fought to make the cut in the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and finished T-65th. After taking a couple of weeks off, he played in the [[Greenbrier Classic]]. Putting problems meant a second straight missed cut at the Greenbrier and a third missed cut at [[The Open Championship|2012 Open Championship]], shooting 73-78 (11 over par). He finished T-43rd at the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]].

He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed a birdie on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole lipped out, resulting in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four shot win over [[Brandt Snedeker]] for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title.

He regained the lead at the par four 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader [[Justin Rose]]. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.\n\nMickelson ended up finishing tied for second with [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]], two strokes behind Justin Rose.

After this victory, Mickelson spoke of his confidence ahead of his participation in the following week's major championship. Mickelson said: \"I've never felt more excited going into The Open.

He failed to contend at the [[2014 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam. Mickelson's lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year's final major, the [[2014 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Valhalla Golf Club|Valhalla]]. Mickelson shot rounds of 69-67-67-66 to finish solo second, one shot behind world number one [[Rory McIlroy]].\n\nPrior to the [[2015 Masters Tournament|2015 Masters]], Mickelson's best finish in [[2015 PGA Tour|2015]] was a tie for 17th. At the Masters, Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|70-68-67-69}} to finish tied for second with [[Justin Rose]], four shots behind champion [[Jordan Spieth]]. The second-place finish was Mickelson's tenth such finish in a major, placing him second all time only to [[Jack Nicklaus]] in that regard.\n\nAt [[2015 Open Championship|The Open Championship]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|70-72-70}} and was eight shots behind, outside the top forty. In the final round, Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} birdie putt on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous Road Hole (17th) at the famed [[Old Course at St Andrews]] onto a second floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out of bounds drive lead to a triple bogey 7 that sent Mickelson tumbling out of contention.\n\nLater in the year, it was announced that Mickelson would leave longtime swing coach Butch Harmon, feeling as though he needed to hear a new perspective on things.\n\n===2016: New swing coach===\nAfter leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach. The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\nUnder Getson's guidance, Mickelson made his [[2016 PGA Tour|2016]] debut at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]]. He shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-68}} to finish in a tie for third place at 21-under-par. It was only Mickelson's fifth top-five finish since his win at the 2013 Open Championship. The third-place finish was Mickelson's highest finish in his first worldwide start of a calendar year since he won the same event to begin the 2004 season.\n\nAt the [[AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-72}} to finish in solo second place, a shot behind [[Vaughn Taylor]]. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot birdie putt to force a playoff on the 72nd hole. He entered the final round with a two stroke lead, his first 54-hole lead since the 2013 U.S. Open and was seeking to end a winless drought dating back 52 worldwide events to the 2013 Open Championship.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-falls-agonisingly-short-at-pebble |title=Phil Mickelson falls agonisingly short at Pebble |date=February 15, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref>\n\nMickelson shot a 63 in the opening round of [[2016 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] at [[Royal Troon Golf Club|Royal Troon]].

In the third round, Mickelson shot a one under 70 for a total of 11 under par to enter the final round one shot back of Stenson. Despite Mickelson's bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner up. Mickelson's 267 total set a record score for a runner up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson's 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner up in major championship history.\n\n===2017: Recovery from surgeries===\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]] was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would've got him to 8-under par instead posting \u22127 {{nowrap|(71-72-67-71)}} to finish T14 at the [[Farmers Insurance Open]]. The following week, at the Waste Management [[Phoenix Open]], which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65. He played his first nine holes in 4-under 32 and sending his name to the top of the leaderboard. However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole. He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.\n\nMickelson came close to winning again at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] where he had finished in second place the previous year to [[Daniel Berger (golfer)|Daniel Berger]]. He started the final round four strokes behind leaders but he quickly played himself into contention. Following a birdie at the 10th hole he vaulted to the top of leaderboard but found trouble on the 12th hole. His tee shot carried out of bounds and his fourth shot hit the water so he had to make a long putt to salvage triple-bogey. He managed to get one shot back but he finished three shots behind winner Berger, in ninth place, for the second straight year.\n\nTwo weeks later he withdrew from the U.S. Open to attend his daughter's high school graduation. A week later his longtime caddie Jim (Bones) Mackay left Mickelson in a mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-and-caddie-bones-part-ways |title=Phil Mickelson and caddie Bones part ways |date=June 20, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> Mickelson then missed the cut at both [[2017 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] and the [[2017 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], shooting one of his worst rounds in a major.\n\nOn September 6, days after posting his best finish of the season of T6 at the [[Dell Technologies Championship]], Mickelson was named as a captain's pick for the [[2017 Presidents Cup|Presidents Cup]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-gets-captains-pick-for-presidents-cup |title=Phil Mickelson gets captain's pick for Presidents Cup |date=September 7, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> This maintained a streak of 23 consecutive USA teams in the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, dating back to 1994.\n\n===2018: Winless streak ends===\nOn March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the [[2018 WGC-Mexico Championship|WGC-Mexico Championship]], with a final round score of 66 and a total score of \u221216. Mickelson birdied two of his last four holes and had a lengthy putt to win outright on the 72nd hole, but tied with [[Justin Thomas (golfer)|Justin Thomas]]. He defeated Thomas on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff with a par. After Thomas had flown the green, Mickelson had a birdie to win the playoff which lipped out.
