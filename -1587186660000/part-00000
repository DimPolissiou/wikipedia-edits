The two then skateboard to a Victorian house in the city's [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore District]] that Jimmie grew up in and says was built by his grandfather in 1946. The home is currently occupied by an older couple, and Jimmie often laments to Mont about how the couple doesn't take care of the house while doing his best to remodel it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house only to find the woman crying on her husband's shoulder and movers taking the couple's things.\n\nJimmie and Mont go to a local realtor, who informs them that the woman's mother had died and now she and her sister are fighting over the house. They use this opportunity to visit the now vacant house and be free to finally re-explore the house in its entirety. Deciding to take up residence, the pair visit Jimmie's aunt Wanda, who gives them the interior decorations that they had when living there. Jimmie and Mont ride back to the home with the help of Wanda's husband, Ricky, and unpack the items, displaying them throughout the house.\n\nOne night, Mont invites Kofi, a childhood friend of Jimmie's and his, to the house, and the three enjoy a night of relaxation. However, the next day, Kofi says hurtful things to Jimmie about his father to appear dominant after being called \"feminine\" by his friends. Jimmie and Mont later find out from Kofi's friends that he has been killed by a man he had a scuffle with. At the same time, the pair find that their possessions have been thrown out of the house and left on the sidewalk, in addition to a sign posted by the realtor they went to earlier. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie fights back by putting all of it right back in. Mont, however, goes to the realtor, who reveals that the house wasn't built by Jimmie's grandfather, and has the deed to prove that it was actually built in the 1850s.\n\nMont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi's death and encourages Jimmie to advertise it to passersby, holding it in the \"witch hat\" of the house. On the day of the performance, Jimmie's estranged father, who he had previously gotten into an argument with, shows. During the performance, Mont shows various social media posts about Kofi's death, all of which he proclaims show that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks various people in the crowd to recount their opinions on Kofi, including Jimmie, who says that even though the last thing that Kofi ever said to him was mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, saying that \"people aren't one thing\". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie's grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the play's audience.\n\nJimmie reunites with Mont at the dock before going home, telling him that he knew all along that his grandfather didn't build the house. He watches TV with Mont and Grandpa Allen before going to bed. Mont wakes up and finds Jimmie gone, with a note that thanks Mont for being his best friend. Mont is left alone, and while he continues the various daily activities that the two would share, when done alone they no longer carry the same sense of joy. He watches from the dock, where Jimmie is far away, rowing in the water outside the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jimmie Fails]] as Jimmie Fails\n* [[Jonathan Majors]] as Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Grandpa Allen\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] as Wanda Fails\n* [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] as James Sr.\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Bobby\n* [[Finn Wittrock]] as Clayton Newsom\n* Isiain Lalime as Gunna (of Chorus)\n* Jamal Trulove as Kofi (of Chorus)\n* Jordan Gomes as Jordan (of Chorus)\n* Maximilienne Ewalt as Mary\n* [[Jello Biafra]] as Tour Guide\n* [[San Quinn]] as Grown Ass Man\n* [[Daewon Song]] as Uncle Ricky\n* Andy Roy as Andy\n* Willie Hen as The Preacher\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Becca\n* Tonya Glanz as Nina\n* Sergio Gonzalez as Banker\n* Wynner Gonzalez as Andrew Joseph\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTalbot and Fails grew up together in [[San Francisco]] and first discussed the possibility of making the movie as teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoodline.com/2015/04/meet-the-misfits-behind-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco|title=Meet The Misfits Behind 'The Last Black Man In San Francisco'|website=Hoodline|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> However, they found it difficult to make the film in the City due to the lack of a film scene within the region<ref>{{Citation|title=Jimmie Fails & Joe Talbot Speaks on 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco' {{!}} Sway's Universe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXi79H0esGY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> and neither of them had any proper film training nor knew anybody within the industry.<ref name=\"apnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/24f15b705fb84e8da325868c96045311|title=The newcomers behind 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco'|date=2019-06-13|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Talbot got some initial advice on how to start from a cold email to [[Barry Jenkins]], who shot ''[[Medicine for Melancholy]]'' (2008) in San Francisco, before he left to shoot [[Moonlight (2016 film)|''Moonlight'']] (2016).<ref name=\"apnews.com\"/>\n\nIn May 2015, the two shot a preview trailer to raise funds for the making of the film and launched a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign that ultimately surpassed their goal of $50,000 by more than $25,000.<ref name=\"sfchronicle1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Childhood-friends-create-The-Last-Black-Man-in-6298033.php|title=Childhood friends create \"The Last Black Man in San Francisco\" -

He spends his time wandering around town with his best friend Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen, whom he also lives with, along with Mont's grandfather. Jimmie waits for the bus with Mont every day, during which they see various states of change in the city and protesters trying to stop it. The two then skateboard to a Victorian house in the city's [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore District]] that Jimmie grew up in and says was built by his grandfather in 1946. The home is currently occupied by an older couple, and Jimmie often laments to Mont about how the couple doesn't take care of the house while doing his best to remodel it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house only to find the woman crying on her husband's shoulder and movers taking the couple's things.\n\nJimmie and Mont go to a local realtor, who informs them that the woman's mother had died and now she and her sister are fighting over the house. They use this opportunity to visit the now vacant house and be free to finally re-explore the house in its entirety. Deciding to take up residence, the pair visit Jimmie's aunt Wanda, who gives them the interior decorations that they had when living there. Jimmie and Mont ride back to the home with the help of Wanda's husband, Ricky, and unpack the items, displaying them throughout the house.\n\nOne night, Mont invites Kofi, a childhood friend of Jimmie's and his, to the house, and the three enjoy a night of relaxation. However, the next day, Kofi says hurtful things to Jimmie about his father to appear dominant after being called \"feminine\" by his friends. Jimmie and Mont later find out from Kofi's friends that he has been killed by a man he had a scuffle with. At the same time, the pair find that their possessions have been thrown out of the house and left on the sidewalk, in addition to a sign posted by the realtor they went to earlier. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie fights back by putting all of it right back in. Mont, however, goes to the realtor, who reveals that the house wasn't built by Jimmie's grandfather, and has the deed to prove that it was actually built in the 1850s.\n\nMont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi's death and encourages Jimmie to advertise it to passersby, holding it in the \"witch hat\" of the house. On the day of the performance, Jimmie's estranged father, who he had previously gotten into an argument with, shows. During the performance, Mont shows various social media posts about Kofi's death, all of which he proclaims show that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks various people in the crowd to recount their opinions on Kofi, including Jimmie, who says that even though the last thing that Kofi ever said to him was mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, saying that \"people aren't one thing\". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie's grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the play's audience.\n\nJimmie reunites with Mont at the dock before going home, telling him that he knew all along that his grandfather didn't build the house. He watches TV with Mont and Grandpa Allen before going to bed. Mont wakes up and finds Jimmie gone, with a note that thanks Mont for being his best friend. Mont is left alone, and while he continues the various daily activities that the two would share, when done alone they no longer carry the same sense of joy. He watches from the dock, where Jimmie is far away, rowing in the water outside the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jimmie Fails]] as Jimmie Fails\n* [[Jonathan Majors]] as Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Grandpa Allen\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] as Wanda Fails\n* [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] as James Sr.\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Bobby\n* [[Finn Wittrock]] as Clayton Newsom\n* Isiain Lalime as Gunna (of Chorus)\n* Jamal Trulove as Kofi (of Chorus)\n* Jordan Gomes as Jordan (of Chorus)\n* Maximilienne Ewalt as Mary\n* [[Jello Biafra]] as Tour Guide\n* [[San Quinn]] as Grown Ass Man\n* [[Daewon Song]] as Uncle Ricky\n* Andy Roy as Andy\n* Willie Hen as The Preacher\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Becca\n* Tonya Glanz as Nina\n* Sergio Gonzalez as Banker\n* Wynner Gonzalez as Andrew Joseph\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTalbot and Fails grew up together in [[San Francisco]] and first discussed the possibility of making the movie as teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoodline.com/2015/04/meet-the-misfits-behind-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco|title=Meet The Misfits Behind 'The Last Black Man In San Francisco'|website=Hoodline|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> However, they found it difficult to make the film in the City due to the lack of a film scene within the region<ref>{{Citation|title=Jimmie Fails & Joe Talbot Speaks on 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco' {{!}} Sway's Universe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXi79H0esGY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> and neither of them had any proper film training nor knew anybody within the industry.<ref name=\"apnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/24f15b705fb84e8da325868c96045311|title=The newcomers behind 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco'|date=2019-06-13|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Talbot got some initial advice on how to start from a cold email to [[Barry Jenkins]], who shot ''[[Medicine for Melancholy]]'' (2008) in San Francisco, before he left to shoot [[Moonlight (2016 film)|''Moonlight'']] (2016).<ref name=\"apnews.com\"/>\n\nIn May 2015, the two shot a preview trailer to raise funds for the making of the film and launched a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign that ultimately surpassed their goal of $50,000 by more than $25,000.<ref name=\"sfchronicle1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Childhood-friends-create-The-Last-Black-Man-in-6298033.php|title=Childhood friends create \"The Last Black Man in San Francisco\" -

{"title_page": "Banner", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\nA '''banner''' can be a [[flag]] or other piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or other message. A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a [[coat of arms]] (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a [[banner of arms]]. Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message.\n\n[[Banner-making]] is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.\n\nThe word derives from [[Old French]] ''baniere'' (modern {{lang-fr|banni\u00e8re}}), from Late Latin ''bandum'', which was borrowed from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] source (compare {{lang-got|\ud800\udf31\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf45\ud800\udf30|translit=bandwa}}). [[Cognate]]s include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''bandiera'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''bandeira'', and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''bandera''.\n\n[[File:A_church_poster.jpg|thumb|A church poster]]\n== Vexillum ==\n{{main|Vexillum}}\nThe vexillum was a flag-like object used as a [[military]] standard by units in the [[Ancient Roman]] army.\n\nThe word ''vexillum'' itself is a diminutive of the Latin word, velum, meaning a sail, which confirms the historical evidence (from coins and sculpture) that vexilla were literally \"little sails\" i.e. flag-like standards. In the vexillum the cloth was draped from a horizontal crossbar suspended from the staff; this is unlike most modern flags in which the 'hoist' of the cloth is attached directly to the vertical [[Staff (military)|staff]].\n\n==Heraldic banners==<!-- This section is linked from [[Flag]] -->\n{{Further|Heraldic flag}}\n\nA heraldic banner, also called a [[banner of arms]], displays the basic [[coat of arms]] only:  i.e. it shows the design usually displayed on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and omits the crest, helmet or coronet, mantling, supporters, motto or any other elements associated with the full [[achievement (heraldry)|armorial achievement]] (for further details of these elements, see [[heraldry]]). A heraldic banner is usually square or rectangular.\n\nA distinction exists between the heraldic banner and the [[heraldic standard]]. The distinction, however, is often misunderstood or ignored. For example, the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] is in fact a banner of the royal arms.\n\n<gallery> \nFile:Royal Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland.svg|<small>The full armorial achievement of the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|arms]] of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (before the [[Union of the Crowns]])</small>\nFile:Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland.svg|<small>The arms as depicted on the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]</small>\nFile:Royal Standard of Scotland.svg|<small> \"[[Royal Banner of Scotland|The Lion Rampant]]\": the banner of the [[King of Scots]]</small>\nFile:Wolsey banner.jpg|<small>Banner of [[Cardinal Wolsey]]</small>\n</gallery>\n\n== Banners in Christianity==\n[[File:Sanctus Gummarus Lyrmensis 04.JPG|thumb|Religious banners of Catholic brotherhoods in Lier, Belgium]]\n[[File:Kirkkoliput.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[Crucession]] with [[lantern]], [[processional cross]] and [[Khorugv]]i (banners).]]\n\nIn the [[Old Testament]], the [[prophet]] [[Isaiah]] was commanded to raise a banner and exalt his voice ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|13:2|KJV}}).  [[Habakkuk]] received a similar order to write a vision upon tables that could be read by one who runs past it ({{bibleverse||Habakkuk|2:2|KJV}}).\n\n{{About||more on the [[design]] and making of church banners|Banner-making|banners used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]|Khorugv}}\n\nBanners in churches have, in the past, been used mainly for [[procession]]s, both inside and outside of the church building. However, the emphasis has, in recent years, shifted markedly towards the permanent or transient display of banners on walls or pillars of churches and other places of worship. A famous example of large banners on display is [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Liverpool R.C. Cathedral]], where the banners are designed by a resident artist.\n\nBanners are also used to communicate the [[Religious testimony|testimony]] of Jesus Christ by [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s and public ministers engaged in [[Open Air Preaching]].\n\n==Trade union banners==\n[[File:TU banners.JPG|thumb|Banners of [[Association of University Teachers|AUT]], [[National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education|NATFHE]], Cambridge [[Labour council|TUC]] and [[Cambridge University Students' Union]].]]\n\nThe [[iconography]] of these banners included mines, mills, factories, but also visions of the future, showing a land where children and adults were well-fed and living in tidy brick-built houses, where the old and sick were cared for, where the burden of work was lessened by new technology, and where leisure time was increasing. The same kind of banners are also used in many other countries. Many, but not all of them, have [[red]] as a dominant colour.\n\n[[File:Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia, Union Banner A928321h.jpg|thumb|Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia, Union Banner A928321h]]\n\nIn [[Australia]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, trade union banners were unfurled with pride in annual Eight Hour Day marches which advocated \u2018Eight Hours Labour, Eight Hours Recreation and Eight Hours Rest\u2019. These marches were one of the most prominent annual celebrations staged in Australia by any group. In Sydney alone, by the early twentieth century, thousands of unionists representing up to seventy different unions would take part in such parades, marching behind the banner emblematic of their trade. Most of these banners have not survived; the Labour Council of NSW has the largest surviving collection at [[Sydney Trades Hall]] Sydney Trades Hall in Sussex Street, Sydney.\n\nThe [[State Library of NSW]] in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] has a small collection of trade union banners that were donated to the Library in the early 1970s such as a Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia banner thought to have been made c. 1913\u20131919. The Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia was formed in 1873 and joined the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union in 1972.\n\nThe banner features a kneeling figure in the centre surrounded by scroll work and is decorated with Australian native flowers and images representative of the work of the Union's members such as a New South Wales Government Railways 34 class steam locomotive, the Hawkesbury River rail bridge built in 1889, and a furnace. The reverse of the banner shows the warship \"Australia\" at sea. The banner is canvas and was painted by Sydney firm Althouse & Geiger, master painters and decorators. Founded in 1875, the company is still in operation. The banner is a powerful interpretive tool in communicating the experience and the history of the Australian labour movement.\n\nFor more on the [[design]] and making of these banners, see [[Banner-making]].\n\n==Sports banners==\n[[File:TIFO FCN.jpg|thumb|[[FC Nantes]] banner]]\n\nSports fans often buy or make banners to display in the grandstands. Team banners typically contain the logo, name or nickname, motto and the team colors. Banners on individual competitors can contain a picture or drawing of the player. Sports banners may also honor notable players or hall-of-fame athletes and commemorate past championships won. These types of sports banners are typically hung from [[rafter]]s in stadiums. The [[Miami Heat]], an [[NBA]] Team, hangs division titles and [[championship]] banners at the top of the rafters in their home stadium, [[American Airlines Arena]]. Similar to other sports banners, they feature the color palette of the team's logo, the logo, names of players, and championship winning years.  In North American indoor professional sports, the previous season's champion traditionally does not install their awarded championship banner until moments prior to their first home game of the season that follows, in a procedure that is chiefly referred to as \"raising the banner\".\n\nUruguay's [[Club Nacional de Football]] supporters made a 600 x 50 metre banner that weighs over 2 tonnes; they claim it is the largest in the world.<ref>[http://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/120811/futnac-657139/futbolnacional/gigante-como-su-hinchada/ Gigante como su hinchada] - Diario Ovci\u00f3n, August 11, 2012</ref> It was unveiled in April 2013 in a [[Copa Libertadores]] football match at the [[Estadio Centenario]].\n\n==Advertising banners==\nOften fabricated commercially on a plastic background, the banner industry has developed from the traditional cut-vinyl banners to banners printed within large, ultra-wide format [[inkjet printer]]s on various vinyl and fabric materials using [[solvent ink]]s and [[ultraviolet-curable ink]]s.\n\nBanners are used in many business ventures, marketing to their potential audience. A number of British towns and cities have whole series of banners decorating their city centers, effectively advertising the town or its special features and attractions.  Pre-printed banners, albeit commonly used, are simple and accessible.  Banners can be printed in enormous formats, with a full range of rich colors. They can also be used in many different physical situations whether it be hanging from an existing fixture, fixed to a wall or even free standing. When an advertising banner is hung or suspended between posts, grommets or another method of attachment are necessary to prevent the banner from tearing or flying away. Aluminum grommets can be punched into the banner and used as secure entry points to tie the banner down. This installation method allows for more durable advertisements. Some vendors offer pre-installed [[grommets]]. Another common form of free standing banners are retractable displays.\n\nBanners can be found plastered behind a window screen, as billboards, atop skyscrapers, or [[aerial advertising|towed by airplanes or blimps]]. As with variable of size and quantity, the number of sides and quality of ink are as much of a crucial factor. In an instance of retail stores which purchase pre-printed clearance banners, or a variety of sale banner. A banner facing underneath or against glass is absorbing exposure from the sun. A banner printed on UV outdoor ink will last several years to a decade where cheaper ink fades, requiring frequent replacement. Being behind glass, a two-sided banner can be displayed from the inside and out, often building recognition between shoppers and caretakers. Three-sided banners are often appealing as there is dimension and can be embellished differently. The more sides that exist, the more angles the banner covers, which is a possibility where a two-sided banner doesn't face the viewer from center of the room or streets.\n\nAnother manifestation of advertising banners, unique to the 21st century, are \"[[banner ad]]s\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/banner+ad|title=Banner ad - Define Banner ad at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> which are advertisements on websites. The banner ads contain hyperlinks to other websites. Also, on free music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora, audio advertisements will play in between songs. One of the common tag lines is \"Click the banner to learn more.\"\n\n==Big letter banners (China)==\nIn China, it is common to find large red coloured banners, especially in schools, factories, government institutions and construction sites. Also called da zi bao ({{zh|s=\u5927\u5b57\u62a5|p=d\u00e0z\u00ecb\u00e0o|l=big-character reports}}), these tend to be big and long, usually with red backgrounds and large Chinese characters. They tend to have motivational messages or industrial milestones on them. Historically, these [[Big-character poster|big character posters]] (da zi bao) were used to convey messages during the [[cultural revolution]], but their use changed after the country's liberalization since 1979.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harvard exhibit showcases Chinese posters hidden for 50 years |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/entertainmentlife/20171119/harvard-exhibit-showcases-chinese-posters-hidden-for-50-years |accessdate=4 June 2018 |publisher=Milford Daily News |date=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n*[[Banners in Northern Ireland]]\n*[[County Clare]] in [[Ireland]] is known as the ''Banner County''.\n*[[Gonfalone]]\n*[[Heraldic standard]]\n*[[Jolly Roger]]\n*[[Knight Banneret]]\n*[[Nobori]]\n*[[Sashimono]]\n*[[Stainless Banner]]\n*''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''\n*[[Vexillum]]\n*[[Vinyl banners]]\n*[[Web banner]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Banners}}\n\n[[Category:Types of flags]]\n[[Category:Signage]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\nA '''banner''' can be a [[flag]] or other piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or other message. A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a [[coat of arms]] (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a [[banner of arms]]. Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message.\n\n[[Banner-making]] is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.\n\nThe word derives from [[Old French]] ''baniere'' (modern {{lang-fr|banni\u00e8re}}), from Late Latin ''bandum'', which was borrowed from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] source (compare {{lang-got|\ud800\udf31\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf45\ud800\udf30|translit=bandwa}}). [[Cognate]]s include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''bandiera'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''bandeira'', and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''bandera''.\n\n== Vexillum ==\n{{main|Vexillum}}\nThe vexillum was a flag-like object used as a [[military]] standard by units in the [[Ancient Roman]] army.\n\nThe word ''vexillum'' itself is a diminutive of the Latin word, velum, meaning a sail, which confirms the historical evidence (from coins and sculpture) that vexilla were literally \"little sails\" i.e. flag-like standards. In the vexillum the cloth was draped from a horizontal crossbar suspended from the staff; this is unlike most modern flags in which the 'hoist' of the cloth is attached directly to the vertical [[Staff (military)|staff]].\n\n==Heraldic banners==<!-- This section is linked from [[Flag]] -->\n{{Further|Heraldic flag}}\n\nA heraldic banner, also called a [[banner of arms]], displays the basic [[coat of arms]] only:  i.e. it shows the design usually displayed on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and omits the crest, helmet or coronet, mantling, supporters, motto or any other elements associated with the full [[achievement (heraldry)|armorial achievement]] (for further details of these elements, see [[heraldry]]).
