It should not be confused with the [[Pyrenean Mastiff]].\n\nAs late as 1874 the breed was not completely standardized in appearance, with two major subtypes recorded, the Western and the Eastern.<ref name=\"Durr 2004\">{{cite book|last=Durr|first=Mark|title=Dog's Best Friend: Annals of the Dog-Human Relationship - 2004 Page 161}}</ref> They are related to several other large, white, European livestock guardian dogs (LGD), including the [[Maremma Sheepdog]] (Italy), the [[Kuvasz]] (Hungary), the [[Akbash]] (Turkey) and the [[Polish Tatra Sheepdog]] or Polski Owczarek Podhala\u0144ski, and somewhat less closely to the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] and the [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]. According to the Great Pyrenees Club of America, the Great Pyrenees is naturally nocturnal and aggressive with any predators that may harm its flock.

Her devotion and dedication to Great Pyrenees continued for more than fifty years.\n\nIn 1931 Basquaerie imported the first Great Pyrenees from France, for the purpose of establishing the breed in America. In 1933 the Great Pyrenees was formally recognized by the American Kennel Club as a pure-bred breed eligible to complete in all AKC competition, this due in large part to the efforts of the Cranes toward achieving this recognition. Basquaerie preserved the finest Great Pyrenees dogs and bloodlines in the world from the ravages and hostilities of WWII in Europe. They imported nearly 60 Great Pyrenees from France and Europe to the United States, representing more than 10 distinct bloodlines or kennels and a diverse population of Great Pyrenees.\n\n===Spread===\n[[File:Chien de Montagne des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es K 01.jpg|thumb|right|A young Great Pyrenees in Krakow]]\n\nIt is possible that Venezuelan [[Mucuchies]] breed descend from the Great Pyrenees, other Spanish breeds, and other few more breeds, that could be introduced in 16th century by Spanish [[conquistador]]s.<ref>[http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/mucuchies.htm \"Mucuchies Information and Pictures\", dogbreedinfo.com]</ref>\n\nThe real spread of the Great Pyrenees out of its mountains developed in the 19th century with the birth of [[Romanticism]]. This breed, first appreciated for its beauty and poise, and then by its innate temperamental qualities, gained fame in the rest of Europe. The Great Pyrenees were introduced in America by [[General Lafayette]] in 1824. In [[Australia]] they were introduced in 1843 to save herds on a farm in [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]].\n\nBy the early 19th century there was a thriving market for the dogs in mountain towns, from which they would be taken to other parts of France.

Her devotion and dedication to Great Pyrenees continued for more than fifty years.\n\nIn 1931 Basquaerie imported the first Great Pyrenees from France, for the purpose of establishing the breed in America. In 1933 the Great Pyrenees was formally recognized by the American Kennel Club as a pure-bred breed eligible to complete in all AKC competition, this due in large part to the efforts of the Cranes toward achieving this recognition. Basquaerie preserved the finest Great Pyrenees dogs and bloodlines in the world from the ravages and hostilities of WWII in Europe. They imported nearly 60 Great Pyrenees from France and Europe to the United States, representing more than 10 distinct bloodlines or kennels and a diverse population of Great Pyrenees.\n\n===Spread===\n[[File:Chien de Montagne des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es K 01.jpg|thumb|right|A young Great Pyrenees in Krakow]]\n\nIt is possible that Venezuelan [[Mucuchies]] breed descend from the Great Pyrenees, other Spanish breeds, and other few more breeds, that could be introduced in 16th century by Spanish [[conquistador]]s.<ref>[http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/mucuchies.htm \"Mucuchies Information and Pictures\", dogbreedinfo.com]</ref>\n\nThe real spread of the Great Pyrenees out of its mountains developed in the 19th century with the birth of [[Romanticism]]. This breed, first appreciated for its beauty and poise, and then by its innate temperamental qualities, gained fame in the rest of Europe. The Great Pyrenees were introduced in America by [[General Lafayette]] in 1824. In [[Australia]] they were introduced in 1843 to save herds on a farm in [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]].\n\nBy the early 19th century there was a thriving market for the dogs in mountain towns, from which they would be taken to other parts of France. The dog was developed to be agile in order to guard sheep on steep, mountainous slopes.<ref name=\"Coile 2005\">{{cite book|last=Coile|first=D.

Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece version but they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the [[KOKO (music venue)|Music Machine]] in London and on 5 August at the [[Mont de Marsan]] Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-[[Velvet Underground]] member [[John Cale]] as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed.

Retrieved 5 December 2011</ref> After the [[Ghost in the Machine Tour]] concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', the film version of [[The Who]]'s [[rock opera]], followed by a role as a mechanic in love with [[Eddie Cochran]]'s music in [[Chris Petit]]'s ''[[Radio On]]''. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the [[Richard Loncraine]] film ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]''. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"[[Spread a Little Happiness]]\" (which appeared on the [[Brimstone & Treacle (soundtrack)|''Brimstone & Treacle'' soundtrack]], along with three new Police tracks, \"How Stupid Mr Bates\", \"A Kind of Loving\", and \"I Burn for You\").

The single \"[[Don't Box Me In]] (theme From ''Rumble Fish'')\", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter [[Stan Ridgway]] (of the band [[Wall of Voodoo]]) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role playing [[Feyd-Rautha]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success.

Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece version but they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the [[KOKO (music venue)|Music Machine]] in London and on 5 August at the [[Mont de Marsan]] Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-[[Velvet Underground]] member [[John Cale]] as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed. The effect of Summers' arrival was instant with Copeland stating: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/>\n\nThe Police's [[power trio]] line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in the English city of [[Birmingham]] in the West Midlands.<ref>Christopher Sandford (2007). \"Sting: Back on the Beat\". p. 53.

In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer [[Eberhard Schoener]]; Copeland also joined for a time. These performances resulted in three albums, each of them an eclectic mix of rock, [[electronica]] and jazz.<ref>\"Trance-Formation\" (EMI 1C 064-32 526) with Andy Summers (1977); \"Flashback\" (EMI 1C 066-32 839) with Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland (1978); \"Video-Magic\" (EMI 1C 064-45 234) with Sting and Andy Summers (1978).</ref> Various appearances by the Schoener outfit on German television made the German public aware of Sting's unusual high-pitched voice, and helped pave the way for the Police's later popularity.\n\nThe [[Blond#bleached blond|bleached-blond]] hair that became a band trademark happened by accident.

Recording ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'' was difficult, as the band was working on a small budget, with no manager or record deal.

Retrieved 5 December 2011</ref> After the [[Ghost in the Machine Tour]] concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', the film version of [[The Who]]'s [[rock opera]], followed by a role as a mechanic in love with [[Eddie Cochran]]'s music in [[Chris Petit]]'s ''[[Radio On]]''. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the [[Richard Loncraine]] film ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]''. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"[[Spread a Little Happiness]]\" (which appeared on the [[Brimstone & Treacle (soundtrack)|''Brimstone & Treacle'' soundtrack]], along with three new Police tracks, \"How Stupid Mr Bates\", \"A Kind of Loving\", and \"I Burn for You\"). Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with [[Robert Fripp]], ''[[I Advance Masked]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[Rumble Fish#Soundtrack|Rumble Fish]]''. The single \"[[Don't Box Me In]] (theme From ''Rumble Fish'')\", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter [[Stan Ridgway]] (of the band [[Wall of Voodoo]]) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role playing [[Feyd-Rautha]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success.
