The games incorporate elements of [[Chinese mythology]] as well as historic figures and events.\n\nIn time immemorial, the \"Xuan-Yuan Sword\" was wielded by [[Yellow Emperor]] of ancient China to defend the ancient Chinese against the warlord [[Chi You]] and his aggressive subjects. After Chi You's defeat, the future for the five-thousand-year-old history of China was secured, and the Sword was passed on from Yellow Emperor to future generations to continue to defend the world against evil. Due to its great power, the sword was often sought by treacherous individuals to further their own ends.\n\nA recurring item of the series is the ''Monster Fusion Vessel'' (''Lian Yao Hu'', \u7149\u5996\u58fa), created by the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] in emulation of the Immortal Creation Ding (\u9020\u7269\u4ed9\u9f0e) to cleanse the world. Within the Vessel resides an immortal entity known as the ''Spirit in the Vessel.'' The Vessel's powers are to absorb nonhuman creatures, and to transmute them into other creatures or items.\n\n== Main series ==\n\n{{VG timeline\n| 1990 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword''\n| 1994 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 2''\n| 1995 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of Maple Banners''\n| 1999 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 3''\n| 2000 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky''\n| 2002 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 4''\n| 2004 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Millennial Destiny''\n| 2006 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 5''\n| 2007 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Han Clouds''\n| 2010 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Clouds Faraway''\n| 2013 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 6''\n| 2015 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament''\n| TBA = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 7''\n}}\n\nThe Xuan-Yuan Sword series is the oldest and longest living Chinese RPG series, totaling 13 RPGs with ancient Chinese-style stories set in ancient Chinese backgrounds. They are:\n* 01 Xuan-Yuan Sword\n* 02 Xuan-Yuan Sword II\n* 03 Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of Maple Banners\n* 04 Xuan-Yuan Sword III: Beyond Clouds and Mountains (The story happened around the time of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]. The protagonist started from Venice, Italy, and crossed the entire Eurasian continent to reach [[Chang'an]], the Capital of the [[Tang Dynasty]] of China)\n* 05 Xuan-Yuan Sword III: Scar of the Sky (The story happened in late [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]])\n* 06 Xuan-Yuan Sword IV: The Black Dragon Dances as Storm Rages (The story Happened in late [[Qin Dynasty]])\n* 07 Xuan-Yuan Sword IV: The Millennial Destiny (Part of the story happened in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of China, in the 6th Century BC, and the other part 1000 years later, during the [[Battle of Fei River]], during the [[East Jin Dynasty]])\n* 08 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: A Sword above the Clouds and the Sentiment of [[Shanhai Jing|Shanhai]] (The story happened in an alternate world called the world of Shanhai, or literally the world of the [[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]. The time is equivalent to late [[Three Kingdoms]] period in our world)\n* 09 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: The Clouds of Han (The story happened in the period of Three Kingdoms of China)\n* 10 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: The Clouds Faraway (The game consists of 3 chapters: the main chapter, the chapter of Lan Ying, and the chapter of [[Wuzhang Plains]]. The story happened in the period of Three Kingdoms.)\n* 11 Xuan-Yuan Sword VI: The Phoenix Soars over Millennial Clouds (The story happened in the [[Zhou dynasty|West Zhou dynasty]])\n* 12 Xuan-Yuan Sword VI: The Gate of Firmament (The story happened in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]])\n* 13 Xuan-Yuan Sword VII (The story happened in late [[Han dynasty|West Han Dynasty]])\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword\")\n\nIn the beginning of the world, the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] created two kinds of intelligent life: those of men, and those of monsters, who warred among each other all the time. The Sword was created by men in an attempt to end the everlasting war. Led by a single heroic figure, Xuan-yuan Swordsman (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u4fe0) who wielded the Sword, the war between humans and monsters ended with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Seventeen years later, the main character, He Ran (\u4f55\u7136), a young swordsman left his mentor to set off on a journey into the chaotic world to carve his own path.\n\nThe first game in the series, Xuan-Yuan Sword was also Softstar's first RPG product and was released in 1990. The time period the game is set in is ambiguous. The game features a [[Dragon Quest]]-like user interface. Players started the game as a novice adventurer with minimal fighting skills and can gain combat experience through battles to enable progression to other areas and advance the plot. The main characters were named after the characters from [[A Chinese Ghost Story]] in this game, but their names were retconned in the second game.\n\nThe game featured standard VGA 16-colored 640x480 screen, complete with party-members, round-based combat, full-screen sprite animation, various monsters, Chinese-styled AdLb music, sound effects, animated spell effects, as well as full Chinese interface, which was a great hit in Taiwan's computer game market at that period.\n\nReleased on October 13, 1990.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 2 ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u8cb3}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 2\")\n\nContinuing from where the first game left off, He Ran (\u4f55\u7136), together with the vigilante Yang Kunshuo (\u694a\u5764\u78a9) and the young thaumaturge Jiang Ruhong (\u6c5f\u5982\u7d05), defeated the dreaded incarnation of the Flaming Phoenix (\u706b\u9cf3\u51f0) (the sinister monster who kidnapped Jiang), befriended a benevolent fox spirit Gu Yuesheng (\u53e4\u6708\u8056), and traveled back in time to find He Ran's parents. They sought to bring about the end of the leader of the invasive monsters, known as the Wicked God (\u60e1\u795e), [[Bashe]], and eventually confronted the treacherous Spirit of the Vessel.\n\nReleased on February 8, 1994.\n\n; Features\n: Many key features of the game series were introduced with this game. It was set in 320\u00d7240 256-colored screen (in the once-popular VGA X-mode). In-game artworks such as scenes, monsters, character portraits, items were fashioned in [[Chinese painting]] style.\n\n; Monster Fusion Vessel\n: Another key feature is the Vessel system. Not long after the beginning of the game, the Monster Fusion Vessel can be acquired, and has two main functions:\n# Absorb enemies encountered in battle, with limitations:\n#* Cannot absorb creatures that have higher experience level than player, and those creatures whose levels are close to the players' are more easily captured when wounded.\n#* Bosses creatures and human enemies cannot be absorbed.\n#* Imprisoned monsters are visible in players inventory and can be summoned to assist during battle with a stamina cost.\n# Transmutation. A player can transmute creatures and items to other objects or creatures. The resulting product may be exceedingly powerful or unobtainable otherwise.\n\n; The Sword\n: In the battle against the final boss, the Vessel Spirit, the goddess N\u00fcwa appeared and revealed the truth that Xuan-Yuan Swordsman was He Ran's father whose spirit has fused with the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Receiving the powerful weapon from the goddess, the protagonist and his company went to the World Within the Vessel and defeated the treacherous Vessel Spirit, sealing him by planting the Xuan-Yuan Sword in his head.\n\nThis installment also introduced a recurring element of the series, the DOMO Studio that is present in all future games in vastly different incarnations that players can visit to access humorous fourth wall-breaking dialogue, quests, and items.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: Beyond the Clouds and Mountains ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u53c3\uff1a\u96f2\u548c\u5c71\u7684\u5f7c\u7aef}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: Beyond Clouds and Mountains\")\n\nThe story opens in [[Venice]] with Septem (\u8cfd\u7279), a Frankish knight and covert intelligence operative of mixed descent from [[Gaul]] who was the lieutenant to [[Pepin the Younger]]. Septem possessed an heirloom bronze vessel with an eastern design, which was in fact the Monster Fusion Vessel. He had heterochromic pupils of blue and brown, garnering discrimination and distrust from his peers and fellow knights over his somewhat Eastern appearance. Miles (\u9ea5\u723e\u65af) (the reincarnation of Satan whose memories and innate powers had not yet been fully awakened), a knight-commander under the guidance of the cleric Cornelius (\u5eb7\u90a3\u91cc\u58eb) (the Dread Lord of Hell in disguise), was the polar opposite of his rival Septem, enforcing the Church's will without mercy and question, executing those designated as heretics without hesitation, and had the affection of Lilian (\u8389\u84ee), a pure maiden Septem had courted in vain. Pepin himself, however, favored Septem, and gave him a quest of great import. He was to go to the East, and find the way to achieve Absolute Victory/the Way of the King. During the journey, a simpleminded demoness named Nicole (\u59ae\u53ef) joined Septem after being summoned by a strange dying man Septem tried to help, as an agent sent by [[Satan]]. Her mission was to awaken Septem's memory of his past life, in which he was Lucifer's most trusted ally who took part in Lucifer's Rebellion, and to convert him to Satan's cause once more, accompanied with promises of wealth, power, and demonic servants, but she eventually abandoned her mission over the fondness she developed for Septem. Kama, a self-proclaimed spirit of love, and Ankh, a snarky talking flying Egyptian black cat accompanying Kama (both of whom Septem encountered in the [[Palmyra#Site|Tadmor Tombs]]), as well as [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] (\u674e\u9756), a Chinese mortal-turned-deity who oversaw the establishment of the Tang dynasty, whose reincarnated self, Master Huiyan, previously accompanied Septem for a short time before sacrificing himself in an attempt to stop a [[Battle of Talas|war between the Abbasid Caliphate (which recently overthrew Umayyad rule) and Tang]] (which ended in the defeat of the Tang forces led by [[Gao Xianzhi]]), also joined the party. Septem also met his eventual wife, Widad (\u8587\u9054), a military leader who defied Arabian patriarchal traditions and who was the reincarnated spirit twin of Kama, and the young grandson of [[Al-Kindi]], whom Septem studied under for a short time around the time of the [[Abbasid Revolution]], as well as Wang Siyue (\u738b\u601d\u6708), a willful young woman from [[Chang'an]] with feelings for Septem, along his journey. After finally reaching China and encountering a variety of conflicts, including the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the group discovered Satan's plan to subjugate all worlds by using the Reversal of [[Mandala]] Ritual (\u53cd\u66fc\u9640\u7f85\u9663), which Septem's past incarnation invented and gained time traversal powers from, to modify the natural laws of causality, and managed to foil it with the assistance of The Immortal of Xuan-yuan Sword (the avatar of the Xuan-Yuan Sword who takes on the form of a stern and wise old man). After Satan's defeat, Septem married Widad, returned to assist [[Charlemagne]] with lessons from his journey-that a ruler must rule in the best interests of the commonfolk, and the way to ensure victory lies in the prevention and cessation of conflicts, and later reunited with Nicole, who was reborn once more as a normal girl by the grace of Heaven.\n\nThe game eschews turn-based battles for the [[Active Time Battle]] combat system, an unusual feature in Chinese RPGs. The refining system in the game has two categories of items and creatures, Eastern and Western, which allows for the creation of different items based on altar selection.\n\nThe game was released on December 4, 1999. An iOS port of the game with additional storylines and scenes meant to expand the portion of the game set in China was released on January 17, 2017.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 4: The Black Dragon Dances as the Storm Rages ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u8086\uff1a\u9ed1\u9f8d\u821e\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 4: The Black Dragon Dances! The Clouds Fly)\n\nThis game is the fourth installment of the main series. The game is the first to be presented in 3D, both in environment and in combat.\nThe story starts with an orphaned girl from the late [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]], Shui Jing (\u6c34\u93e1) and her senior disciple-sister, Qu Xian (\u5c48\u5afb) on the top of a mountain with their seniors from the House of [[Mohism|Mo]], a Mohist clan actively opposing the tyranny of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[King Zheng of Qin|its leader]], who is often accompanied by a mysterious purple-skinned adviser (later revealed to be the original Vessel Spirit on an ideological mission to create an unified utopia by absorbing the mortal world into the universe created by the Spirit - \"Realm in the Clouds\"). Qu Xian witnessed her companions being murdered by giant mechanical constructs created with the Jiguan technique. Later, Shui Jing meets with Ji Liang (\u59ec\u826f) (later known as [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] \u5f35\u826f), a well-educated young man from the annihilated [[Han (state)|Han state]] who can utilize the Scroll of Heaven (Tian Shu \u5929\u66f8) in battles after obtaining and deciphering it in an early escapade with Shui Jing, and Ji Peng (\u75be\u9d6c), a humorous talking bird king who employs a humanoid Jiguan body in battle. The three journey across various lands to combat the machinations of the Qin Empire and the Vessel Spirit. Later in the story, Ji Peng is revealed to be the bird owned by the Mo clan leader's husband, Fu Ziche (\u8f14\u5b50\u5fb9) (introduced in Dance of Maple along with the current Mo leader, Lady Wenjin (\u7d0b\u9326), renowned for her eternal youthfulness), who had been sealed in ice in the World Within the Vessel after a battle with the Vessel Spirit during which he averted disaster by preventing the Black Fire the Vessel Spirit unleashed using a purple crystal in desperation from taking form. The trio eventually reconcile their differences with the Spirit, rescued Fu Ziche, and confronted the true threat, battling with all nine portions of Black Fire (with each portion increasing its power and all nine portions 4^128 times as powerful as one portion alone) running amok, which is believed to be the ultimate weapon of the Hell that can take the form of a black dragon, discovered long ago using purple crystals by the ancient Shu kingdom engineer Qi, who caused the destruction of his civilization and was sealed away in a protective cocoon until the events of the game, when he took control of Lady Wenjin (who was created with Black Fire) and Black Fire to go on a rampage to destroy the world (or in his mind, creating a world where hell and the mortal realm co-existed in order to eliminate death) upon awakening.\n\nReleased on the August 4, 2002.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 5: A Sword Above the Clouds and the Sentiments of the World of Shanhai ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u4f0d\uff1a\u4e00\u528d\u51cc\u96f2\u5c71\u6d77\u60c5}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 5: A Sword Soaring Above Clouds; Shanhai Sentiments\")\n\nThe main character Lu Chengxuan (\u9678\u627f\u8ed2) killed his parents as a result of not being able control his mysterious power, and was about to die in the wilderness as an outcast when he was coincidentally brought to the World of [[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shanhai]] through a portal created by Huangfu Muyun (\u7687\u752b\u66ae\u96f2), a powerful wielder of sword energy and the avatar of the Xuanyuan Sword, using the Pangu Axe. There, he encounters Xia Rou (\u590f\u67d4), second empress of the Kingdom of Women. The two traveled around the world, meeting with people from other kingdoms, and set out to accomplish a task given to them by the Elder of the Green Dragon Kingdom, leading to a confrontation with the exiled Princess of Heaven, [[N\u00fcba|Qing'er (\u9752\u5152)]], who helped the [[Yellow Emperor]], Ji Xuanyuan (\u59ec\u8ed2\u8f45), claim the mortal world for humans and was banished due to her newly acquired form causing cataclysmic droughts after expending her power in aiding him in reforging the sword that would later be known as the Xuan Yuan Sword.\n\nReleased on August 4, 2006.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 6: The Phoenix Soars in the Sky among Millennial Clouds ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u9678\uff1a\u9cf3\u51cc\u9577\u7a7a\u5343\u8f09\u96f2}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 6: The Fenghuang Rising High Above the Sky and Thousand-year Clouds\")\n\nIn c. 1046 BCE, the [[Battle of Muye]] erupted. The leader of the Zhou of the west, [[Ji Fa]], took the opportunity presented when [[King Zhou of Shang]] rallied his forces in a southeastern expedition and when the Shang capital of [[Zhaoge]] was undefended to form an alliance with leaders in the west at [[Mengjin]] to perform a swift strike against the capital.\n\nHearing of the impending attack, the Shang king was caught off guard and forced to head to Muye for battle, and ended up burning himself alive on the [[Deer Terrace Pavilion]], thus ending the six-hundred-year reign of the [[Shang Dynasty]] and ushering in the era of the [[Zhou Dynasty]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Muye, the tense atmosphere remained between the Shang and Zhou people. The Shang remnant forces retreated to the largest vassal state in the east, [[Qufu|Yan (\u5944\u570b)]], for a respite until a chance for rebellion arose. King Zhou's son, [[Wu Geng]], was held at Zhaoge.  King Wu of Zhou (formerly known as Ji Fa) assigned land and title to him, but ordered his three younger brothers to keep Wu Geng confined and under surveillance to prevent rebellion. With the passing of King Wu from illness, the [[Duke of Zhou]] who served as a royal advisor was accused of attempting to seize the throne, and had to resign to prove his innocence, causing the kingdom to be leaderless and the political situation to become volatile. The Shang sought to seize this chance to attack [[Haojing]] to reclaim the kingdom. A war between the east and west appears to be imminent, and at the same time, a mysterious force stirs in the dark.\n\nThe game opens with a cinematic of a battle between [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and Shang forces at the Xia capital [[Zhenxun]] that concludes with the end of the Xia Dynasty and the deaths of two Xia lovers, the warrior Si Tianjia (\u59d2\u5929\u7532) and the priestess Miao Ji (\u82d7\u59ec). The two promise each other to transmigrate as enemies of Shang to oppose it together in their next lives. As they lay dying, a Xia artifact, the Holy Circlet of Tianhuan carried by Miao Ji splits into two halves and merges with Si Tianjia and Miao Ji.\n\nThe story focuses on the conflict among the reigning Zhou and the subordinate Shang states. The main character, Feng Tianling (\u9cf3\u5929\u51cc), is a proud young Shang noble raised in Yan who can see and communicate with spirits and supernatural creatures. A benevolent spirit, Hupo (\u7425\u73c0 Amber), has been his friend and companion since he was young. He sets out on a journey of self-discovery and encounters companions and enemies alike along the way amidst growing omens of [[Rebellion of the Three Guards|war]]. Feng Tianling's companions are Huyue (\u745a\u6708), a beautiful maiden from a [[Huli jing|mysterious tribe]] who is attached to Tianling because of a supposedly destined marriage, Ji Ting (\u59ec\u4ead), the Zhou princess skilled in archery who values bravery and prowess, Jialanduo/Kalandra (\u8fe6\u862d\u591a), a [[Tianzhu (India)|Shendu]] royal with [[chakra]] manipulation skills who is searching for his sister, and Rong Shuang (\u84c9\u971c), a young Black Fire Sect disciple from [[Shu (state)|Shu]] on a mission with her fellows to recover their cultural artifact, Black Fire.\n\nThe DLC Chapter of Zhuo Shanzhu (\u6fc1\u5c71\u9444\u7bc7), released as an free update, features a story involving Zhuo Shanzhu (\u6fc1\u5c71\u9444), the elder brother of Rong Shuang previously presumed to be dead, and his investigation of the nature of Black Fire, the Black Fire Sect, and the history and technology of the lost kingdom of Sanmu.\n\n==Tales ([[Gaiden]]) titles==\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of the Maple Banners===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u6953\u4e4b\u821e}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: Dance of Maple\")\n\nThe first standalone expansion episode in the series, the story of ''Dance of the Maple Banners'' (\u6953\u4e4b\u821e) was based on the [[Warring States period]] in [[Chinese History]]. The Sword fell into the hands of the political radical, ''Shusangzi'' (\u8700\u6851\u5b50 or Sang Jing \u6851\u51c8). The main character Fu Ziche (\u8f14\u5b50\u5fb9) is an eccentric young disciple of [[Mozi]], and is also an expert in mechanical engineering, especially in the creation and manipulation of Jiguan Ren (\u6a5f\u95dc\u4eba), man-sized mechanical golems powered by mystic energy. Jiguan Ren were originally developed for war, but their designs were hidden away for fear of being misused. Shusangzi had re-discovered this technology, and developed a large Jiguan army for his own ends. Upon learning of this, [[Mozi]] sent Fu Ziche to investigate, and if possible, to stop Shusangzi. On his quest, he encountered Wenjin (\u7d0b\u9326), the estranged daughter of Sang created with the aid of the power of the Vessel, and they eventually fell in love.\n\nBeing the first game in the series to have connection with real world history, Dance of the Maple Banners inherited most of the previous game's interface, arts, and battle system, with subtle modifications, and wrapped with new plot. More realistic ancient war machines were made alive, while historical figures such as Mozi, [[Lu Ban]], [[Sun Bin]], could be encountered in the game.\n\nAs were the cases with most other standalone tales titles, players do not have the chance to wield the Sword. In this game the Sword is in Shu Sangzi's possession, and is used against players. In the final battle, Shu uses a move called ''Xuan-Yuan Sword Technique'' (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u6cd5), which inflicts serious damage to the player party.\n\nReleased on January 6, 1995.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u53c3\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u5929\u4e4b\u75d5}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 3 Legend: The Scar of the Sky\")\nSet in the era of [[Sui Dynasty]], 150 years prior to the events of Xuan-Yuan Sword 3, this game addressed several loose threads in Xuan-Yuan Sword 3.\n\nThe main character is a young man named Chen Jingchou (\u9673\u9756\u4ec7, meaning \"To pacify the northern foes and to avenge Chen.\"), the only royal descendant remaining from the decimated [[Chen Dynasty]]. The final attempt for counterattack from the Chen family happened several years before Chen Jingchou was born, when the tens-of-thousands-strong remnants of Chen forces were single-handedly decimated by a 10-year-old Sui child, Yang Tuo (\u694a\u62d3) (later known as Yuwen Tuo \u5b87\u6587\u62d3), a student of [[Yang Su]].\n\nHaving lived under the reign of those who destroyed his kingdom, Chen Jingchou had been educated by his mentor, Chen Fu (\u9673\u8f14), to pursue a life of vengeance and of reviving his kingdom. The first step of their journey to restore Chen was to acquire the Mirror of Kunlun, one of the Ten Great Ancient Artifacts.<ref>\u300e\u9418\u528d\u65a7\u58fa\u5854\uff0c\u7434\u9f0e\u5370\u93e1\u77f3\u300f, thus ''Bell, Sword, Axe, Vessel, Tower, Zither, Ding, Seal, Mirror, and Stone.''</ref>\n\nThe ancient monstrosity [[Taotie]] was released from a mirror that was revealed to be a fake. In order to protect Jingchou, Fu trapped himself with Taotie using a potent Silk of Ice spell, and instructed Jingchou to embark at once to find a way to save him, as well as finding information concerning other Artifacts. As he set out on his journey, Jingchou summoned an elemental spirit familiar given to him by his master to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nJingchou later was later joined by Yu Xiaoxue (\u4e8e\u5c0f\u96ea), a white haired girl showing unusual healing magic potential, the honorable half [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]]-blooded hero Zhang Lie (\u5f35\u70c8)<ref>Zhang Lie, \u5f35\u70c8, [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] blooded warlord of the north from the novel ''\u866f\u9aef\u5ba2\u50b3'', by \u675c\u5149\u5ead.</ref> and Zhang's young sister-in-law Tuoba Yu'er (\u62d3\u62d4\u7389\u5152) of the Tuoba tribe, which kept the Shennong Ding for generations and was subject to indiscriminate slaughter by the Sui emperor's troops. During their expedition in collecting the Artifacts, they encountered several Blood Rituals of Ten Thousand Souls, rites conducted by [[Grand Preceptor]] Yuwen Tuo which involved the killing of ten thousand souls to gather their essences into a single Blood Pearl. The party attempted to intervene with the rituals, but Yuwen Tuo proved to be too formidable a foe. Thus they adopted the strategy of subterfuge, hampering his every effort to collect the Blood Pearls without direct confrontations, and was even helped in secret by a young princess named Dugu Ningke (\u7368\u5b64\u5be7\u73c2), who held tremendous political power due to her relation with her uncle, [[Emperor Yang of Sui|the emperor]], and protested Yuwen's actions.\n\nEventually, their plan failed, and Yu Xiaoxue was held as a hostage by Tuo in exchange for the Artifacts that Jingchou's party had collected, namely the [[Shennong]] [[Ding (vessel)|Ding]], the Seal of Kongtong, the [[Pangu]] Axe, the [[N\u00fcwa]] Stone, and the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]] Mirror. Jingchou complied, yet Tuo discarded the Stone and the mirror as fakes, proclaiming that he himself was actually the human avatar of the Kunlun Mirror. Surprisingly, Yu Xiaoxue refused to leave with Jingchou, stating that she intended to stay and help Tuo's project, and seemingly betrays his trust by repelling his attack on Yuwen's plans wielding the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Losing all hope, Jingchou gave up his quest and opted to travel with his similarly disheartened mentor.\n\nNingke, who was actually a demon general dispatched from the western pantheon of Hell, was displeased with this turn of events. She infiltrated China by possessing the original Princess Dugu who died of illness, and arrived in anticipation of what was calculated to be the time a [[Historical comet observations in China#Comets in Chinese astrology|comet]] named Crimson Piercer (Chi Guan - \u8d64\u8cab) would pass through the sky, opening a rift in the divine protective barrier of the Chinese lands and allowing an opportunity for demons from the West to invade. Tuo learned of the implications of the passage of the comet, and set out to collect five of the Artifacts in order to seal the rift the comet would cause in the Barrier of the Ninth [[Tian|Heaven]] in the firmament above [[Names of China#Shenzhou|Shenzhou]]. However, several of the five Artifacts required for the Ritual of Mending were nowhere to be found. Ningke proposed that he substitute these with Blood Pearls along with the construction of a [[Tower of Babel]], and a [[Pentagram]] ritual formation. In order to save the Chinese world, using his power, his riches and his relation with the [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Emperor Yang]], Tuo managed to accomplish these despite his moral misgivings. In the process, Tuo also discovered that Xiaoxue was actually the avatar of the Stone of N\u00fcwa, as Artifacts resonate with each other when in close proximity. Consequently, he told her of his plan and convinced her to help him, leading to misunderstandings between her and Jingchou.\n\nNingke could not allow the Ritual to be abandoned and manipulated Jingchou through treachery by murdering Yu'er, who learned the truth behind the situation after going to the Grand Preceptor Residence in secret in an attempt to reconcile Xiaoxue and Jingchou, and framing Xiaoxue and Tuo. Fueled by anger and grief, Jingchou's party managed to reach the top of the Tower of Babel, where they were beaten once again by Tuo. Ningke suddenly appeared in the confusion and seized Xiaoxue as hostage to divert Tuo's attention. Jingchou took the opportunity and severed Tuo's arm. Ningke then revealed her true demon form, imprisoning Tuo with magic. Unable to mend the sky, the Chinese world fell under [[Satan]]'s rule of death and destruction.\n\nDays later, under the instruction of the now immortal He Ran and Gu Yuesheng (last seen in Xuan-Yuan Sword 2), Jingchou's group, which now also includes a young [[Li Shimin]] successfully retrieved the Artifacts from Ningke's handmaidens in the bloodied world, and returned to the Tower. They defeated Ningke with her full unrestricted power, and rescued Tuo. Having the Artifacts at hand, Jingchou and company invoked the Ritual of Reversal (which is also named the Ritual of Loss, \u5931\u537b\u4e4b\u9663) at the top of Tower of Babel, which, utilizing the power of Tuo as the avatar the Mirror of Kunlun at the ritual formation's center, reversed time and brought the party back to the moment prior to the passing of Chi Guan.\n\nThe group invoked the Ritual of Trespass (also called the Ritual of Babel), sending them above the sky, and arrived at Chi Guan itself. Coming across the Heavenly Maiden White Jade Ring (\u5929\u5973\u767d\u7389\u8f2a), an eight trigrams formation used by the deities Fuxi and N\u00fcwa to revive their deceased daughter in ancient times, Jingchou had the choice to bring Yu'er back to life at the cost of expending a great deal of Xiaoxue's power. At the heart of the meteor, where the party prepared to cast the Ritual of Sealing, which caused the non-artifact casters to lose their most precious memories or ideals (with Zhang Lie losing his ambition of unifying the lands, Li Shimin losing his love for his family, and Jingchou losing his memories of Yu'er or his master depending on the ending), Ningke, then still alive and ignorant of the recent events Jingchou and his companions experienced, appeared and attempted to continue her deception, but a fight ensued, and Ningke was vanquished. The party decided to grant her final wishes: to be returned to her homeland, and to become free to love whom she loves. Gu stated that was impossible due to her demonic nature, and placed her soul into the Fuxi [[Guqin|Qin]] (\u4f0f\u7fb2\u7434), which Yuwen Tuo brought with him on his self-imposed exile to the west, Ningke's homeland, after the events of the game for her soul to be cleansed eventually.\n\nChen Fu witnessed what appeared to be Jingchou assisting in the machinations of Yuwen Tuo, their sworn enemy. Ningke exploited this before heading to Chi Guan by giving Chen Fu the Fruit of Satan, a demonic object that grants power in exchange for sanity, deceiving him into battling against his student. Chen Fu soon arrived at the heart of Chi Guan with the intent to destroy it. Jingchou's group was left with no choice but to kill Chen Fu to save the world.\n\nSeveral decades later, Ningke was reborn as Nicole, a demon cleansed of evil, while Septem was born to a descendant of Tuo in western lands.\n\nThe Magic System is revamped in this game. All magics now belong to one of the [[five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth (\u91d1\u6728\u6c34\u706b\u571f)]] in Chinese mythology.\n\nThe game was released on December 2, 2000.  A [[Xuan-Yuan Sword: Scar of Sky|television series]] based from the game, produced by Chinese Entertainment Shanghai Limited, starring [[Hu Ge]] and [[Cecilia Liu]], aired in 2012.\n\nAn iOS port of the game was released on April 8, 2014.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Millennial Destiny===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u84bc\u4e4b\u6fe4}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: Billows of the Bleak\")\nThe game opens with an alternate version of the [[Battle of Fei River]], a battle between [[Former Qin]] and [[Eastern Jin]]. It concludes with Eastern Jin's surrender to Former Qin. Former Qin merged with Eastern Jin and united the entirety of China.\n\nSet within the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the story is told from the perspective of an orphaned girl, Che Yun (\u8eca\u82b8), whose family was framed by a corrupt official and executed. She was spared from execution due to her age, but her legs were amputated as punishment. Che Yun was talented in the art of Mujia - a technique of creating and manipulating constructs of magnets and wooden machinery, which are lightweight yet powerful, with her late grandfather as her inspiration. She fashioned herself wooden prosthetic legs and managed to craft a lifelike and agile wooden fox that can be used in various tasks such as transportation and battle, Yunhu (\u96f2\u72d0), after much effort and coming across rare materials. She was a close friend with Huan Yuanzhi (\u6853\u9060\u4e4b), whom Che Yun saved from drowning and who assisted her in creating Yunhu with exotic components. Che Yun later encountered Ying Shi (\u5b34\u8a69) (who is [[reincarnation]] of Che Yun except that Ying was from a different era and was named Murong Shi - \u6155\u5bb9\u8a69). With Che Yun as a common link, Huan and Ying formed a grudging alliance and adventured together, coming into conflicts with the Jin Kingdom's Tai Chen Gong, a priest organization focused on increasing its power and influence, and Heralds of the Seven Luminaries (\u4e03\u66dc\u4f7f\u8005 \"Qiyao Shizhe\"), a group of powerful rebels from a bleak future timeline sent back with the help of the student of the then-deceased Spirit of the Vessel. At the culmination of the story, Che, Ying and Huan reached the deepest chamber of the Realm of Haotian containing the wheel that determines the destiny of and relationship between all things, Wheel of [[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]] (\u592a\u4e00\u4e4b\u8f2a \"Taiyi Zhi Lun\"). However, Murong and Huan were both duty-bound to set history on diverging courses in favor of their homelands. Che intended to stop Huan from changing the future despite Murong having decided against intervening with history by ordering Yunhu to push Huan away. However, Huan wielded the Xuan-Yuan Sword and injured Che fatally by accident while repelling Yunhu. The gate to the Palace then closed abruptly. Murong, unable to extract her friends was transported out of the gate, leaving Huan and Che in the room where Huan, immortal due to the power of his surroundings, mourned in regret for a thousand years. At the instant of Che Yun's death, Murong realized their link and inherited the knowledge of Mujia. She entered the gate when it next opened in a thousand years after she returned to the future in which Jin overcame Qin to fight for the welfare of the common-folk, encountering a sorrowful aged Huan and offering forgiveness and acceptance as Che Yun would have.\n\nReleased on February 6, 2004.\n\nOn December 3, 2015, an animated series based on the game called ''[[Xuan Yuan Sword Luminary]]'' (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\uff1a\u84bc\u4e4b\u66dc / Ken En Ken: Aoki Kagayaki, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword: Lights of the Bleak\") was announced as a collaborative project with [[TV Tokyo]] and [[Studio Deen]] and began airing on October 2, 2018 in Mainland China, Taiwan, as well as Japan.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Han Clouds===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u6f22\u4e4b\u96f2}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: The Clouds of Han\")\nReleased on December 19, 2007.\n\nThe game is set in the era of the [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and feature famous historic figures. [[Zhuge Liang]], the chancellor of the kingdom of Shu had engaged on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|multiple northward military expeditions]] with little success. On Zhuge Liang's Third Expedition, a secret military group called \"Fei Yu\" (\u98db\u7fbd)(meaning Flying Feather, deriving its name from the two famous generals of Shu kingdom - [[Zhang Fei]] and [[Guan Yu]])carried out various missions in the war to further the interests of Shu. However, on the Fourth Expedition, Thanks to its own group of powerful secret operatives, Wei was able to discover and exploit critical weaknesses of Shu, prompting The Feathers to take action. The game addresses issues of loyalty and duty, as well as the harsh realities of warfare and peace.\n\n[[Xuan-Yuan Sword: Han Cloud|A live-action television series based on the game]] has been released.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Clouds Faraway===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u96f2\u4e4b\u9059}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: The Clouds Faraway\")\nReleased on January 12, 2010.\n\nThe Clouds Faraway, also set in the era of the [[Three Kingdoms]], is presented with a contrasting viewpoint to the Han Clouds. The main character, Xu Muyun (\u5f90\u66ae\u96f2), was adopted by [[Xu Shu]] and raised in the Kingdom of [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. Muyun grew up with his childhood friends Lanyin (\u862d\u8335) and Zhang Gao (\u5f35\u8aa5) in the house of [[Zhang He]], and the three youngsters vowed to fight for their homeland and bring about prosperous days together. Through his journey, Muyun came to a new level of maturity, learned of his true identity, realized the meaning of duty and friendship, and witnessed the ruthlessness of war.\n\nThe story is continued after the main game in three DLC chapters, released to enrich the story. These three chapters are: The Chapter of [[Wuzhang Plains]]: Muyun ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u4e08\u539f\u66ae\u96f2\u7bc7}}), The Chapter of Wuzhang Plains: Zhaoyun ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u4e08\u539f\u671d\u96f2\u7bc7}}), and the lengthy and critically acclaimed Chapter of Lan Yin ({{zh|c=\u862d\u8335\u7bc7}}).\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u7a79\u4e4b\u6249}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: The Gate of the Heavens\")\nReleased on March 26, 2015.\n\nIn ancient times, the Heavenly Emperor opened the Gate of Firmament, connecting the Heavens and Earth. Mortals could ascend to the Gate to obtain divine power in order to assist in the search for the Emperor's missing daughter. Unscrupulous individuals took advantage of the Emperor's gesture, and caused the mortal world to descend into chaos. The lives of the common folk were filled with anxiety and weariness. The god [[Fuxi]] and the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] took pity on the people, and along with [[Zhuanxu]], convinced the Queen of Huaxu (\u83ef\u80e5\u4e4b\u4e3b, based on Lady Huaxu \u83ef\u80e5\u6c0f) to close the Gate forcibly with great sacrifice. After this, no one could reach the Heavens through the Gate, and no god could go to the mortal world; thus came about the Isolation of the Heavens and Earth (Jueditiantong \u7d55\u5730\u5929\u901a). Time passed, and the mortal realm suffered due to disasters and endless conflicts over [[Mandate of Heaven|claims to rule]], embroiled in political instability and riotous events.

The games incorporate elements of [[Chinese mythology]] as well as historic figures and events.\n\nIn time immemorial, the \"Xuan-Yuan Sword\" was wielded by [[Yellow Emperor]] of ancient China to defend the ancient Chinese against the warlord [[Chi You]] and his aggressive subjects. After Chi You's defeat, the future for the five-thousand-year-old history of China was secured, and the Sword was passed on from Yellow Emperor to future generations to continue to defend the world against evil. Due to its great power, the sword was often sought by treacherous individuals to further their own ends.\n\nA recurring item of the series is the ''Monster Fusion Vessel'' (''Lian Yao Hu'', \u7149\u5996\u58fa), created by the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] in emulation of the Immortal Creation Ding (\u9020\u7269\u4ed9\u9f0e) to cleanse the world. Within the Vessel resides an immortal entity known as the ''Spirit in the Vessel.'' The Vessel's powers are to absorb nonhuman creatures, and to transmute them into other creatures or items.\n\n== Main series ==\n\n{{VG timeline\n| 1990 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword''\n| 1994 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 2''\n| 1995 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of Maple Banners''\n| 1999 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 3''\n| 2000 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky''\n| 2002 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 4''\n| 2004 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Millennial Destiny''\n| 2006 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 5''\n| 2007 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Han Clouds''\n| 2010 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Clouds Faraway''\n| 2013 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 6''\n| 2015 = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament''\n| TBA = ''Xuan-Yuan Sword 7''\n}}\n\nThe Xuan-Yuan Sword series is the oldest and longest living Chinese RPG series, totaling 13 RPGs with ancient Chinese-style stories set in ancient Chinese backgrounds. They are:\n* 01 Xuan-Yuan Sword\n* 02 Xuan-Yuan Sword II\n* 03 Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of Maple Banners\n* 04 Xuan-Yuan Sword III: Beyond Clouds and Mountains (The story happened around the time of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]. The protagonist started from Venice, Italy, and crossed the entire Eurasian continent to reach [[Chang'an]], the Capital of the [[Tang Dynasty]] of China)\n* 05 Xuan-Yuan Sword III: Scar of the Sky (The story happened in late [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]])\n* 06 Xuan-Yuan Sword IV: The Black Dragon Dances as Storm Rages (The story Happened in late [[Qin Dynasty]])\n* 07 Xuan-Yuan Sword IV: The Millennial Destiny (Part of the story happened in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of China, in the 6th Century BC, and the other part 1000 years later, during the [[Battle of Fei River]], during the [[East Jin Dynasty]])\n* 08 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: A Sword above the Clouds and the Sentiment of [[Shanhai Jing|Shanhai]] (The story happened in an alternate world called the world of Shanhai, or literally the world of the [[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]. The time is equivalent to late [[Three Kingdoms]] period in our world)\n* 09 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: The Clouds of Han (The story happened in the period of Three Kingdoms of China)\n* 10 Xuan-Yuan Sword V: The Clouds Faraway (The game consists of 3 chapters: the main chapter, the chapter of Lan Ying, and the chapter of [[Wuzhang Plains]]. The story happened in the period of Three Kingdoms.)\n* 11 Xuan-Yuan Sword VI: The Phoenix Soars over Millennial Clouds (The story happened in the [[Zhou dynasty|West Zhou dynasty]])\n* 12 Xuan-Yuan Sword VI: The Gate of Firmament (The story happened in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]])\n* 13 Xuan-Yuan Sword VII (The story happened in late [[Han dynasty|West Han Dynasty]])\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword\")\n\nIn the beginning of the world, the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] created two kinds of intelligent life: those of men, and those of monsters, who warred among each other all the time. The Sword was created by men in an attempt to end the everlasting war. Led by a single heroic figure, Xuan-yuan Swordsman (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u4fe0) who wielded the Sword, the war between humans and monsters ended with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Seventeen years later, the main character, He Ran (\u4f55\u7136), a young swordsman left his mentor to set off on a journey into the chaotic world to carve his own path.\n\nThe first game in the series, Xuan-Yuan Sword was also Softstar's first RPG product and was released in 1990. The time period the game is set in is ambiguous. The game features a [[Dragon Quest]]-like user interface. Players started the game as a novice adventurer with minimal fighting skills and can gain combat experience through battles to enable progression to other areas and advance the plot. The main characters were named after the characters from [[A Chinese Ghost Story]] in this game, but their names were retconned in the second game.\n\nThe game featured standard VGA 16-colored 640x480 screen, complete with party-members, round-based combat, full-screen sprite animation, various monsters, Chinese-styled AdLb music, sound effects, animated spell effects, as well as full Chinese interface, which was a great hit in Taiwan's computer game market at that period.\n\nReleased on October 13, 1990.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 2 ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u8cb3}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 2\")\n\nContinuing from where the first game left off, He Ran (\u4f55\u7136), together with the vigilante Yang Kunshuo (\u694a\u5764\u78a9) and the young thaumaturge Jiang Ruhong (\u6c5f\u5982\u7d05), defeated the dreaded incarnation of the Flaming Phoenix (\u706b\u9cf3\u51f0) (the sinister monster who kidnapped Jiang), befriended a benevolent fox spirit Gu Yuesheng (\u53e4\u6708\u8056), and traveled back in time to find He Ran's parents. They sought to bring about the end of the leader of the invasive monsters, known as the Wicked God (\u60e1\u795e), [[Bashe]], and eventually confronted the treacherous Spirit of the Vessel.\n\nReleased on February 8, 1994.\n\n; Features\n: Many key features of the game series were introduced with this game. It was set in 320\u00d7240 256-colored screen (in the once-popular VGA X-mode). In-game artworks such as scenes, monsters, character portraits, items were fashioned in [[Chinese painting]] style.\n\n; Monster Fusion Vessel\n: Another key feature is the Vessel system. Not long after the beginning of the game, the Monster Fusion Vessel can be acquired, and has two main functions:\n# Absorb enemies encountered in battle, with limitations:\n#* Cannot absorb creatures that have higher experience level than player, and those creatures whose levels are close to the players' are more easily captured when wounded.\n#* Bosses creatures and human enemies cannot be absorbed.\n#* Imprisoned monsters are visible in players inventory and can be summoned to assist during battle with a stamina cost.\n# Transmutation. A player can transmute creatures and items to other objects or creatures. The resulting product may be exceedingly powerful or unobtainable otherwise.\n\n; The Sword\n: In the battle against the final boss, the Vessel Spirit, the goddess N\u00fcwa appeared and revealed the truth that Xuan-Yuan Swordsman was He Ran's father whose spirit has fused with the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Receiving the powerful weapon from the goddess, the protagonist and his company went to the World Within the Vessel and defeated the treacherous Vessel Spirit, sealing him by planting the Xuan-Yuan Sword in his head.\n\nThis installment also introduced a recurring element of the series, the DOMO Studio that is present in all future games in vastly different incarnations that players can visit to access humorous fourth wall-breaking dialogue, quests, and items.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: Beyond the Clouds and Mountains ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u53c3\uff1a\u96f2\u548c\u5c71\u7684\u5f7c\u7aef}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: Beyond Clouds and Mountains\")\n\nThe story opens in [[Venice]] with Septem (\u8cfd\u7279), a Frankish knight and covert intelligence operative of mixed descent from [[Gaul]] who was the lieutenant to [[Pepin the Younger]]. Septem possessed an heirloom bronze vessel with an eastern design, which was in fact the Monster Fusion Vessel. He had heterochromic pupils of blue and brown, garnering discrimination and distrust from his peers and fellow knights over his somewhat Eastern appearance. Miles (\u9ea5\u723e\u65af) (the reincarnation of Satan whose memories and innate powers had not yet been fully awakened), a knight-commander under the guidance of the cleric Cornelius (\u5eb7\u90a3\u91cc\u58eb) (the Dread Lord of Hell in disguise), was the polar opposite of his rival Septem, enforcing the Church's will without mercy and question, executing those designated as heretics without hesitation, and had the affection of Lilian (\u8389\u84ee), a pure maiden Septem had courted in vain. Pepin himself, however, favored Septem, and gave him a quest of great import. He was to go to the East, and find the way to achieve Absolute Victory/the Way of the King. During the journey, a simpleminded demoness named Nicole (\u59ae\u53ef) joined Septem after being summoned by a strange dying man Septem tried to help, as an agent sent by [[Satan]]. Her mission was to awaken Septem's memory of his past life, in which he was Lucifer's most trusted ally who took part in Lucifer's Rebellion, and to convert him to Satan's cause once more, accompanied with promises of wealth, power, and demonic servants, but she eventually abandoned her mission over the fondness she developed for Septem. Kama, a self-proclaimed spirit of love, and Ankh, a snarky talking flying Egyptian black cat accompanying Kama (both of whom Septem encountered in the [[Palmyra#Site|Tadmor Tombs]]), as well as [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] (\u674e\u9756), a Chinese mortal-turned-deity who oversaw the establishment of the Tang dynasty, whose reincarnated self, Master Huiyan, previously accompanied Septem for a short time before sacrificing himself in an attempt to stop a [[Battle of Talas|war between the Abbasid Caliphate (which recently overthrew Umayyad rule) and Tang]] (which ended in the defeat of the Tang forces led by [[Gao Xianzhi]]), also joined the party. Septem also met his eventual wife, Widad (\u8587\u9054), a military leader who defied Arabian patriarchal traditions and who was the reincarnated spirit twin of Kama, and the young grandson of [[Al-Kindi]], whom Septem studied under for a short time around the time of the [[Abbasid Revolution]], as well as Wang Siyue (\u738b\u601d\u6708), a willful young woman from [[Chang'an]] with feelings for Septem, along his journey. After finally reaching China and encountering a variety of conflicts, including the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the group discovered Satan's plan to subjugate all worlds by using the Reversal of [[Mandala]] Ritual (\u53cd\u66fc\u9640\u7f85\u9663), which Septem's past incarnation invented and gained time traversal powers from, to modify the natural laws of causality, and managed to foil it with the assistance of The Immortal of Xuan-yuan Sword (the avatar of the Xuan-Yuan Sword who takes on the form of a stern and wise old man). After Satan's defeat, Septem married Widad, returned to assist [[Charlemagne]] with lessons from his journey-that a ruler must rule in the best interests of the commonfolk, and the way to ensure victory lies in the prevention and cessation of conflicts, and later reunited with Nicole, who was reborn once more as a normal girl by the grace of Heaven.\n\nThe game eschews turn-based battles for the [[Active Time Battle]] combat system, an unusual feature in Chinese RPGs. The refining system in the game has two categories of items and creatures, Eastern and Western, which allows for the creation of different items based on altar selection.\n\nThe game was released on December 4, 1999. An iOS port of the game with additional storylines and scenes meant to expand the portion of the game set in China was released on January 17, 2017.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 4: The Black Dragon Dances as the Storm Rages ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u8086\uff1a\u9ed1\u9f8d\u821e\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 4: The Black Dragon Dances! The Clouds Fly)\n\nThis game is the fourth installment of the main series. The game is the first to be presented in 3D, both in environment and in combat.\nThe story starts with an orphaned girl from the late [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]], Shui Jing (\u6c34\u93e1) and her senior disciple-sister, Qu Xian (\u5c48\u5afb) on the top of a mountain with their seniors from the House of [[Mohism|Mo]], a Mohist clan actively opposing the tyranny of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[King Zheng of Qin|its leader]], who is often accompanied by a mysterious purple-skinned adviser (later revealed to be the original Vessel Spirit on an ideological mission to create an unified utopia by absorbing the mortal world into the universe created by the Spirit - \"Realm in the Clouds\"). Qu Xian witnessed her companions being murdered by giant mechanical constructs created with the Jiguan technique. Later, Shui Jing meets with Ji Liang (\u59ec\u826f) (later known as [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] \u5f35\u826f), a well-educated young man from the annihilated [[Han (state)|Han state]] who can utilize the Scroll of Heaven (Tian Shu \u5929\u66f8) in battles after obtaining and deciphering it in an early escapade with Shui Jing, and Ji Peng (\u75be\u9d6c), a humorous talking bird king who employs a humanoid Jiguan body in battle. The three journey across various lands to combat the machinations of the Qin Empire and the Vessel Spirit. Later in the story, Ji Peng is revealed to be the bird owned by the Mo clan leader's husband, Fu Ziche (\u8f14\u5b50\u5fb9) (introduced in Dance of Maple along with the current Mo leader, Lady Wenjin (\u7d0b\u9326), renowned for her eternal youthfulness), who had been sealed in ice in the World Within the Vessel after a battle with the Vessel Spirit during which he averted disaster by preventing the Black Fire the Vessel Spirit unleashed using a purple crystal in desperation from taking form. The trio eventually reconcile their differences with the Spirit, rescued Fu Ziche, and confronted the true threat, battling with all nine portions of Black Fire (with each portion increasing its power and all nine portions 4^128 times as powerful as one portion alone) running amok, which is believed to be the ultimate weapon of the Hell that can take the form of a black dragon, discovered long ago using purple crystals by the ancient Shu kingdom engineer Qi, who caused the destruction of his civilization and was sealed away in a protective cocoon until the events of the game, when he took control of Lady Wenjin (who was created with Black Fire) and Black Fire to go on a rampage to destroy the world (or in his mind, creating a world where hell and the mortal realm co-existed in order to eliminate death) upon awakening.\n\nReleased on the August 4, 2002.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 5: A Sword Above the Clouds and the Sentiments of the World of Shanhai ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u4f0d\uff1a\u4e00\u528d\u51cc\u96f2\u5c71\u6d77\u60c5}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 5: A Sword Soaring Above Clouds; Shanhai Sentiments\")\n\nThe main character Lu Chengxuan (\u9678\u627f\u8ed2) killed his parents as a result of not being able control his mysterious power, and was about to die in the wilderness as an outcast when he was coincidentally brought to the World of [[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shanhai]] through a portal created by Huangfu Muyun (\u7687\u752b\u66ae\u96f2), a powerful wielder of sword energy and the avatar of the Xuanyuan Sword, using the Pangu Axe. There, he encounters Xia Rou (\u590f\u67d4), second empress of the Kingdom of Women. The two traveled around the world, meeting with people from other kingdoms, and set out to accomplish a task given to them by the Elder of the Green Dragon Kingdom, leading to a confrontation with the exiled Princess of Heaven, [[N\u00fcba|Qing'er (\u9752\u5152)]], who helped the [[Yellow Emperor]], Ji Xuanyuan (\u59ec\u8ed2\u8f45), claim the mortal world for humans and was banished due to her newly acquired form causing cataclysmic droughts after expending her power in aiding him in reforging the sword that would later be known as the Xuan Yuan Sword.\n\nReleased on August 4, 2006.\n\n=== Xuan-Yuan Sword 6: The Phoenix Soars in the Sky among Millennial Clouds ===\n\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u9678\uff1a\u9cf3\u51cc\u9577\u7a7a\u5343\u8f09\u96f2}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 6: The Fenghuang Rising High Above the Sky and Thousand-year Clouds\")\n\nIn c. 1046 BCE, the [[Battle of Muye]] erupted. The leader of the Zhou of the west, [[Ji Fa]], took the opportunity presented when [[King Zhou of Shang]] rallied his forces in a southeastern expedition and when the Shang capital of [[Zhaoge]] was undefended to form an alliance with leaders in the west at [[Mengjin]] to perform a swift strike against the capital.\n\nHearing of the impending attack, the Shang king was caught off guard and forced to head to Muye for battle, and ended up burning himself alive on the [[Deer Terrace Pavilion]], thus ending the six-hundred-year reign of the [[Shang Dynasty]] and ushering in the era of the [[Zhou Dynasty]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Muye, the tense atmosphere remained between the Shang and Zhou people. The Shang remnant forces retreated to the largest vassal state in the east, [[Qufu|Yan (\u5944\u570b)]], for a respite until a chance for rebellion arose. King Zhou\u2019s son, [[Wu Geng]], was held at Zhaoge.  King Wu of Zhou (formerly known as Ji Fa) assigned land and title to him, but ordered his three younger brothers to keep Wu Geng confined and under surveillance to prevent rebellion. With the passing of King Wu from illness, the [[Duke of Zhou]] who served as a royal advisor was accused of attempting to seize the throne, and had to resign to prove his innocence, causing the kingdom to be leaderless and the political situation to become volatile. The Shang sought to seize this chance to attack [[Haojing]] to reclaim the kingdom. A war between the east and west appears to be imminent, and at the same time, a mysterious force stirs in the dark.\n\nThe game opens with a cinematic of a battle between [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and Shang forces at the Xia capital [[Zhenxun]] that concludes with the end of the Xia Dynasty and the deaths of two Xia lovers, the warrior Si Tianjia (\u59d2\u5929\u7532) and the priestess Miao Ji (\u82d7\u59ec). The two promise each other to transmigrate as enemies of Shang to oppose it together in their next lives. As they lay dying, a Xia artifact, the Holy Circlet of Tianhuan carried by Miao Ji splits into two halves and merges with Si Tianjia and Miao Ji.\n\nThe story focuses on the conflict among the reigning Zhou and the subordinate Shang states. The main character, Feng Tianling (\u9cf3\u5929\u51cc), is a proud young Shang noble raised in Yan who can see and communicate with spirits and supernatural creatures. A benevolent spirit, Hupo (\u7425\u73c0 Amber), has been his friend and companion since he was young. He sets out on a journey of self-discovery and encounters companions and enemies alike along the way amidst growing omens of [[Rebellion of the Three Guards|war]]. Feng Tianling's companions are Huyue (\u745a\u6708), a beautiful maiden from a [[Huli jing|mysterious tribe]] who is attached to Tianling because of a supposedly destined marriage, Ji Ting (\u59ec\u4ead), the Zhou princess skilled in archery who values bravery and prowess, Jialanduo/Kalandra (\u8fe6\u862d\u591a), a [[Tianzhu (India)|Shendu]] royal with [[chakra]] manipulation skills who is searching for his sister, and Rong Shuang (\u84c9\u971c), a young Black Fire Sect disciple from [[Shu (state)|Shu]] on a mission with her fellows to recover their cultural artifact, Black Fire.\n\nThe DLC Chapter of Zhuo Shanzhu (\u6fc1\u5c71\u9444\u7bc7), released as an free update, features a story involving Zhuo Shanzhu (\u6fc1\u5c71\u9444), the elder brother of Rong Shuang previously presumed to be dead, and his investigation of the nature of Black Fire, the Black Fire Sect, and the history and technology of the lost kingdom of Sanmu.\n\n==Tales ([[Gaiden]]) titles==\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: Dance of the Maple Banners===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u6953\u4e4b\u821e}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: Dance of Maple\")\n\nThe first standalone expansion episode in the series, the story of ''Dance of the Maple Banners'' (\u6953\u4e4b\u821e) was based on the [[Warring States period]] in [[Chinese History]]. The Sword fell into the hands of the political radical, ''Shusangzi'' (\u8700\u6851\u5b50 or Sang Jing \u6851\u51c8). The main character Fu Ziche (\u8f14\u5b50\u5fb9) is an eccentric young disciple of [[Mozi]], and is also an expert in mechanical engineering, especially in the creation and manipulation of Jiguan Ren (\u6a5f\u95dc\u4eba), man-sized mechanical golems powered by mystic energy. Jiguan Ren were originally developed for war, but their designs were hidden away for fear of being misused. Shusangzi had re-discovered this technology, and developed a large Jiguan army for his own ends. Upon learning of this, [[Mozi]] sent Fu Ziche to investigate, and if possible, to stop Shusangzi. On his quest, he encountered Wenjin (\u7d0b\u9326), the estranged daughter of Sang created with the aid of the power of the Vessel, and they eventually fell in love.\n\nBeing the first game in the series to have connection with real world history, Dance of the Maple Banners inherited most of the previous game's interface, arts, and battle system, with subtle modifications, and wrapped with new plot. More realistic ancient war machines were made alive, while historical figures such as Mozi, [[Lu Ban]], [[Sun Bin]], could be encountered in the game.\n\nAs were the cases with most other standalone tales titles, players do not have the chance to wield the Sword. In this game the Sword is in Shu Sangzi's possession, and is used against players. In the final battle, Shu uses a move called ''Xuan-Yuan Sword Technique'' (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u6cd5), which inflicts serious damage to the player party.\n\nReleased on January 6, 1995.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u53c3\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u5929\u4e4b\u75d5}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword 3 Legend: The Scar of the Sky\")\nSet in the era of [[Sui Dynasty]], 150 years prior to the events of Xuan-Yuan Sword 3, this game addressed several loose threads in Xuan-Yuan Sword 3.\n\nThe main character is a young man named Chen Jingchou (\u9673\u9756\u4ec7, meaning \"To pacify the northern foes and to avenge Chen.\"), the only royal descendant remaining from the decimated [[Chen Dynasty]]. The final attempt for counterattack from the Chen family happened several years before Chen Jingchou was born, when the tens-of-thousands-strong remnants of Chen forces were single-handedly decimated by a 10-year-old Sui child, Yang Tuo (\u694a\u62d3) (later known as Yuwen Tuo \u5b87\u6587\u62d3), a student of [[Yang Su]].\n\nHaving lived under the reign of those who destroyed his kingdom, Chen Jingchou had been educated by his mentor, Chen Fu (\u9673\u8f14), to pursue a life of vengeance and of reviving his kingdom. The first step of their journey to restore Chen was to acquire the Mirror of Kunlun, one of the Ten Great Ancient Artifacts.<ref>\u300e\u9418\u528d\u65a7\u58fa\u5854\uff0c\u7434\u9f0e\u5370\u93e1\u77f3\u300f, thus ''Bell, Sword, Axe, Vessel, Tower, Zither, Ding, Seal, Mirror, and Stone.''</ref>\n\nThe ancient monstrosity [[Taotie]] was released from a mirror that was revealed to be a fake. In order to protect Jingchou, Fu trapped himself with Taotie using a potent Silk of Ice spell, and instructed Jingchou to embark at once to find a way to save him, as well as finding information concerning other Artifacts. As he set out on his journey, Jingchou summoned an elemental spirit familiar given to him by his master to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nJingchou later was later joined by Yu Xiaoxue (\u4e8e\u5c0f\u96ea), a white haired girl showing unusual healing magic potential, the honorable half [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]]-blooded hero Zhang Lie (\u5f35\u70c8)<ref>Zhang Lie, \u5f35\u70c8, [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] blooded warlord of the north from the novel ''\u866f\u9aef\u5ba2\u50b3'', by \u675c\u5149\u5ead.</ref> and Zhang's young sister-in-law Tuoba Yu'er (\u62d3\u62d4\u7389\u5152) of the Tuoba tribe, which kept the Shennong Ding for generations and was subject to indiscriminate slaughter by the Sui emperor's troops. During their expedition in collecting the Artifacts, they encountered several Blood Rituals of Ten Thousand Souls, rites conducted by [[Grand Preceptor]] Yuwen Tuo which involved the killing of ten thousand souls to gather their essences into a single Blood Pearl. The party attempted to intervene with the rituals, but Yuwen Tuo proved to be too formidable a foe. Thus they adopted the strategy of subterfuge, hampering his every effort to collect the Blood Pearls without direct confrontations, and was even helped in secret by a young princess named Dugu Ningke (\u7368\u5b64\u5be7\u73c2), who held tremendous political power due to her relation with her uncle, [[Emperor Yang of Sui|the emperor]], and protested Yuwen's actions.\n\nEventually, their plan failed, and Yu Xiaoxue was held as a hostage by Tuo in exchange for the Artifacts that Jingchou's party had collected, namely the [[Shennong]] [[Ding (vessel)|Ding]], the Seal of Kongtong, the [[Pangu]] Axe, the [[N\u00fcwa]] Stone, and the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]] Mirror. Jingchou complied, yet Tuo discarded the Stone and the mirror as fakes, proclaiming that he himself was actually the human avatar of the Kunlun Mirror. Surprisingly, Yu Xiaoxue refused to leave with Jingchou, stating that she intended to stay and help Tuo's project, and seemingly betrays his trust by repelling his attack on Yuwen's plans wielding the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Losing all hope, Jingchou gave up his quest and opted to travel with his similarly disheartened mentor.\n\nNingke, who was actually a demon general dispatched from the western pantheon of Hell, was displeased with this turn of events. She infiltrated China by possessing the original Princess Dugu who died of illness, and arrived in anticipation of what was calculated to be the time a [[Historical comet observations in China#Comets in Chinese astrology|comet]] named Crimson Piercer (Chi Guan - \u8d64\u8cab) would pass through the sky, opening a rift in the divine protective barrier of the Chinese lands and allowing an opportunity for demons from the West to invade. Tuo learned of the implications of the passage of the comet, and set out to collect five of the Artifacts in order to seal the rift the comet would cause in the Barrier of the Ninth [[Tian|Heaven]] in the firmament above [[Names of China#Shenzhou|Shenzhou]]. However, several of the five Artifacts required for the Ritual of Mending were nowhere to be found. Ningke proposed that he substitute these with Blood Pearls along with the construction of a [[Tower of Babel]], and a [[Pentagram]] ritual formation. In order to save the Chinese world, using his power, his riches and his relation with the [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Emperor Yang]], Tuo managed to accomplish these despite his moral misgivings. In the process, Tuo also discovered that Xiaoxue was actually the avatar of the Stone of N\u00fcwa, as Artifacts resonate with each other when in close proximity. Consequently, he told her of his plan and convinced her to help him, leading to misunderstandings between her and Jingchou.\n\nNingke could not allow the Ritual to be abandoned and manipulated Jingchou through treachery by murdering Yu'er, who learned the truth behind the situation after going to the Grand Preceptor Residence in secret in an attempt to reconcile Xiaoxue and Jingchou, and framing Xiaoxue and Tuo. Fueled by anger and grief, Jingchou's party managed to reach the top of the Tower of Babel, where they were beaten once again by Tuo. Ningke suddenly appeared in the confusion and seized Xiaoxue as hostage to divert Tuo's attention. Jingchou took the opportunity and severed Tuo's arm. Ningke then revealed her true demon form, imprisoning Tuo with magic. Unable to mend the sky, the Chinese world fell under [[Satan]]'s rule of death and destruction.\n\nDays later, under the instruction of the now immortal He Ran and Gu Yuesheng (last seen in Xuan-Yuan Sword 2), Jingchou's group, which now also includes a young [[Li Shimin]] successfully retrieved the Artifacts from Ningke's handmaidens in the bloodied world, and returned to the Tower. They defeated Ningke with her full unrestricted power, and rescued Tuo. Having the Artifacts at hand, Jingchou and company invoked the Ritual of Reversal (which is also named the Ritual of Loss, \u5931\u537b\u4e4b\u9663) at the top of Tower of Babel, which, utilizing the power of Tuo as the avatar the Mirror of Kunlun at the ritual formation's center, reversed time and brought the party back to the moment prior to the passing of Chi Guan.\n\nThe group invoked the Ritual of Trespass (also called the Ritual of Babel), sending them above the sky, and arrived at Chi Guan itself. Coming across the Heavenly Maiden White Jade Ring (\u5929\u5973\u767d\u7389\u8f2a), an eight trigrams formation used by the deities Fuxi and N\u00fcwa to revive their deceased daughter in ancient times, Jingchou had the choice to bring Yu'er back to life at the cost of expending a great deal of Xiaoxue's power. At the heart of the meteor, where the party prepared to cast the Ritual of Sealing, which caused the non-artifact casters to lose their most precious memories or ideals (with Zhang Lie losing his ambition of unifying the lands, Li Shimin losing his love for his family, and Jingchou losing his memories of Yu'er or his master depending on the ending), Ningke, then still alive and ignorant of the recent events Jingchou and his companions experienced, appeared and attempted to continue her deception, but a fight ensued, and Ningke was vanquished. The party decided to grant her final wishes: to be returned to her homeland, and to become free to love whom she loves. Gu stated that was impossible due to her demonic nature, and placed her soul into the Fuxi [[Guqin|Qin]] (\u4f0f\u7fb2\u7434), which Yuwen Tuo brought with him on his self-imposed exile to the west, Ningke's homeland, after the events of the game for her soul to be cleansed eventually.\n\nChen Fu witnessed what appeared to be Jingchou assisting in the machinations of Yuwen Tuo, their sworn enemy. Ningke exploited this before heading to Chi Guan by giving Chen Fu the Fruit of Satan, a demonic object that grants power in exchange for sanity, deceiving him into battling against his student. Chen Fu soon arrived at the heart of Chi Guan with the intent to destroy it. Jingchou's group was left with no choice but to kill Chen Fu to save the world.\n\nSeveral decades later, Ningke was reborn as Nicole, a demon cleansed of evil, while Septem was born to a descendant of Tuo in western lands.\n\nThe Magic System is revamped in this game. All magics now belong to one of the [[five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth (\u91d1\u6728\u6c34\u706b\u571f)]] in Chinese mythology.\n\nThe game was released on December 2, 2000.  A [[Xuan-Yuan Sword: Scar of Sky|television series]] based from the game, produced by Chinese Entertainment Shanghai Limited, starring [[Hu Ge]] and [[Cecilia Liu]], aired in 2012.\n\nAn iOS port of the game was released on April 8, 2014.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Millennial Destiny===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u84bc\u4e4b\u6fe4}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: Billows of the Bleak\")\nThe game opens with an alternate version of the [[Battle of Fei River]], a battle between [[Former Qin]] and [[Eastern Jin]]. It concludes with Eastern Jin's surrender to Former Qin. Former Qin merged with Eastern Jin and united the entirety of China.\n\nSet within the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the story is told from the perspective of an orphaned girl, Che Yun (\u8eca\u82b8), whose family was framed by a corrupt official and executed. She was spared from execution due to her age, but her legs were amputated as punishment. Che Yun was talented in the art of Mujia - a technique of creating and manipulating constructs of magnets and wooden machinery, which are lightweight yet powerful, with her late grandfather as her inspiration. She fashioned herself wooden prosthetic legs and managed to craft a lifelike and agile wooden fox that can be used in various tasks such as transportation and battle, Yunhu (\u96f2\u72d0), after much effort and coming across rare materials. She was a close friend with Huan Yuanzhi (\u6853\u9060\u4e4b), whom Che Yun saved from drowning and who assisted her in creating Yunhu with exotic components. Che Yun later encountered Ying Shi (\u5b34\u8a69) (who is [[reincarnation]] of Che Yun except that Ying was from a different era and was named Murong Shi - \u6155\u5bb9\u8a69). With Che Yun as a common link, Huan and Ying formed a grudging alliance and adventured together, coming into conflicts with the Jin Kingdom's Tai Chen Gong, a priest organization focused on increasing its power and influence, and Heralds of the Seven Luminaries (\u4e03\u66dc\u4f7f\u8005 \"Qiyao Shizhe\"), a group of powerful rebels from a bleak future timeline sent back with the help of the student of the then-deceased Spirit of the Vessel. At the culmination of the story, Che, Ying and Huan reached the deepest chamber of the Realm of Haotian containing the wheel that determines the destiny of and relationship between all things, Wheel of [[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]] (\u592a\u4e00\u4e4b\u8f2a \"Taiyi Zhi Lun\"). However, Murong and Huan were both duty-bound to set history on diverging courses in favor of their homelands. Che intended to stop Huan from changing the future despite Murong having decided against intervening with history by ordering Yunhu to push Huan away. However, Huan wielded the Xuan-Yuan Sword and injured Che fatally by accident while repelling Yunhu. The gate to the Palace then closed abruptly. Murong, unable to extract her friends was transported out of the gate, leaving Huan and Che in the room where Huan, immortal due to the power of his surroundings, mourned in regret for a thousand years. At the instant of Che Yun's death, Murong realized their link and inherited the knowledge of Mujia. She entered the gate when it next opened in a thousand years after she returned to the future in which Jin overcame Qin to fight for the welfare of the common-folk, encountering a sorrowful aged Huan and offering forgiveness and acceptance as Che Yun would have.\n\nReleased on February 6, 2004.\n\nOn December 3, 2015, an animated series based on the game called ''[[Xuan Yuan Sword Luminary]]'' (\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\uff1a\u84bc\u4e4b\u66dc / Ken En Ken: Aoki Kagayaki, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword: Lights of the Bleak\") was announced as a collaborative project with [[TV Tokyo]] and [[Studio Deen]] and began airing on October 2, 2018 in Mainland China, Taiwan, as well as Japan.\n\n===Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Han Clouds===\n({{zh|c=\u8ed2\u8f45\u528d\u5916\u50b3\uff1a\u6f22\u4e4b\u96f2}}, literally \"Xuan-Yuan Sword Legend: The Clouds of Han\")\nReleased on December 19, 2007.\n\nThe game is set in the era of the [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and feature famous historic figures.

Mortals could ascend to the Gate to obtain divine power in order to assist in the search for the Emperor's missing daughter. Unscrupulous individuals took advantage of the Emperor's gesture, and caused the mortal world to descend into chaos. The lives of the common folk were filled with anxiety and weariness. The god [[Fuxi]] and the goddess [[N\u00fcwa]] took pity on the people, and along with [[Zhuanxu]], convinced the Queen of Huaxu (\u83ef\u80e5\u4e4b\u4e3b, based on Lady Huaxu \u83ef\u80e5\u6c0f) to close the Gate forcibly with great sacrifice. After this, no one could reach the Heavens through the Gate, and no god could go to the mortal world; thus came about the Isolation of the Heavens and Earth (Jueditiantong \u7d55\u5730\u5929\u901a).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]].

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The [[Riverfront Transit Center]], built under 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sports games and school field trips.  When it was built, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail.  On days it is not in use for sports games, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |title=Riverfront Transit Center|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|title=I-Team: $48 million transit station sits empty|first=Brendan|last=Keefe|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216100317/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|archive-date=February 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|title=Cincinnati's Riverfront Transit Center Attracts Criticism|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112215226/http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clr}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of people from Cincinnati}}\n\n==Sister cities==\nCincinnati has ten [[town twinning|sister cities]].<ref name=\"sisters\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | publisher=Cincinnati Sister City Association | title=Cincinnati Sister Cities | accessdate=February 5, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203503/http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n* {{flagdeco|JOR}} \u2013 [[Amman]], Jordan\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} \u2013 [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu City]], Japan\n* {{flagdeco|ZWE}} \u2013 [[Harare]], Zimbabwe\n* {{flagdeco|UKR}} \u2013 [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} \u2013 [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]], People's Republic of China <!--PRC must be spelled in full-->\n* {{flagdeco|DEU}} \u2013 [[Munich]], Germany\n* {{flagdeco|IND}} \u2013 [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]], India\n* {{flagdeco|FRA}} \u2013 [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], France\n* {{flagdeco|ROC}} \u2013 [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], Republic of China\n* {{flagdeco|HUN}} \u2013 [[Szeged]], Hungary\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ohio|North America|United States}}\n* [[City Plan for Cincinnati]]\n* [[Cincinnati metropolitan area|Greater Cincinnati]]\n* [[List of Cincinnati neighborhoods]]\n* [[List of mayors of Cincinnati]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Cincinnati]]\n* [[Streetcars in Cincinnati]] (historical)\n* [[Vine Street, Cincinnati]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* George W.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

It is also served by [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]], [[Interstate 74 (Ohio)|Interstate 74]], [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]] and numerous U.S. highways: [[U.S. Highway 22 (Ohio)|US 22]], [[U.S. Highway 25 (Ohio)|US 25]], [[U.S. Highway 27 (Ohio)|US 27]], [[U.S. Highway 42 (Ohio)|US 42]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|US 50]], [[U.S. Highway 52 (Ohio)|US 52]], and [[U.S. Highway 127 (Ohio)|US 127]].  The [[Riverfront Transit Center]], built under 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sports games and school field trips.  When it was built, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail.  On days it is not in use for sports games, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |title=Riverfront Transit Center|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|title=I-Team: $48 million transit station sits empty|first=Brendan|last=Keefe|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216100317/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|archive-date=February 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|title=Cincinnati's Riverfront Transit Center Attracts Criticism|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112215226/http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clr}}\n\n==Notable people==\n[[List of people from Cincinnati]]\n\n==Sister cities==\nCincinnati has ten [[town twinning|sister cities]].<ref name=\"sisters\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | publisher=Cincinnati Sister City Association | title=Cincinnati Sister Cities | accessdate=February 5, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203503/http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n* {{flagdeco|JOR}} \u2013 [[Amman]], Jordan\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} \u2013 [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu City]], Japan\n* {{flagdeco|ZWE}} \u2013 [[Harare]], Zimbabwe\n* {{flagdeco|UKR}} \u2013 [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} \u2013 [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]], People's Republic of China <!--PRC must be spelled in full-->\n* {{flagdeco|DEU}} \u2013 [[Munich]], Germany\n* {{flagdeco|IND}} \u2013 [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]], India\n* {{flagdeco|FRA}} \u2013 [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], France\n* {{flagdeco|ROC}} \u2013 [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], Republic of China\n* {{flagdeco|HUN}} \u2013 [[Szeged]], Hungary\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ohio|North America|United States}}\n* [[City Plan for Cincinnati]]\n* [[Cincinnati metropolitan area|Greater Cincinnati]]\n* [[List of Cincinnati neighborhoods]]\n* [[List of mayors of Cincinnati]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Cincinnati]]\n* [[Streetcars in Cincinnati]] (historical)\n* [[Vine Street, Cincinnati]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* George W.

He was first appointed to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] in 1972, having previously served on the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].\n\n==Education==\nRaised in Sydney, Mason was a student at [[Sydney Grammar School]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], holding the rank of [[Flying Officer]]. After the war, Mason studied at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. Mason [[articled clerk|articled]] at [[Clayton Utz]], where he met his wife, Patricia.<ref>http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/justices/coper_hca8_mason.pdf</ref>\n\n==Legal career==\n[[File:Anthony Mason QC.jpg|thumb|upright|Mason as Solicitor-General, wearing [[court dress]]]]\nMason was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1951, and was appointed a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1964. For five years, Mason lectured in law at the [[University of Sydney]], his students including three future High Court Justices, [[Mary Gaudron]], [[William Gummow]] and [[Dyson Heydon]]. Mason was the [[Commonwealth Solicitor-General]] from 1964 to 1969. During this time, he contributed greatly to the development of the Commonwealth's [[Australian administrative law|administrative law]] system.\n\n==Judicial career==\nIn 1969, Mason was made a judge of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]], where he sat as a member of the [[Court of Appeal of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]]. He held this position until 1972, when he was appointed to the bench of the [[High Court of Australia]] and received a knighthood ([[KBE]]). After fifteen years on the High Court, and following the retirement of Sir [[Harry Gibbs]], in 1987 Mason was appointed Chief Justice; he retired in 1995 on reaching the constitutionally mandatory retirement age of 70.\n\nMason had a significant influence over the High Court. Initially a conservative judge, his tenure as Chief Justice can be seen as the high-water mark of the movement away from the \"strict legalism\" which characterised the High Court under Sir [[Owen Dixon]]. Mason was more flexible in his attitude to [[precedent]] than many other judges, viewing it more as a policy for consistency than something which would strictly coerce and constrain his decisions.\n\nDuring the years of the \"Mason Court\", a variety of important cases were decided.  These included:\n*''[[Cole v Whitfield]]'' (1988): a landmark decision on the meaning of [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 92.  The unanimous judgment observed (par. 7):\n\n{{quotation|No provision of the Constitution has been the source of greater judicial concern or the subject of greater judicial effort than s.92. That notwithstanding, judicial exegesis of the section has yielded neither clarity of meaning nor certainty of operation. Over the years the Court has moved uneasily between one interpretation and another in its endeavours to solve the problems thrown up by the necessity to apply the very general language of the section to a wide variety of legislative and factual situations. Indeed, these shifts have been such as to make it difficult to speak of the section as having achieved a settled or accepted interpretation at any time since federation. The interpretation which came closest to achieving that degree of acceptance was that embodying the criterion of operation formula which we shall subsequently examine in some detail. That formula appeared to have the advantage of certainty, but that advantage proved to be illusory. Its disadvantage was that it was concerned only with the formal structure of an impugned law and ignored its real or substantive effect.}}\n\n:For the first time, the Constitution was interpreted with systematic reference to records of the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional conventions]] of the 1890s in which the text of the Constitution had been agreed (a good edition of the records had recently appeared).  The Court also examined not only the \"legal\" operation of a law (its effects upon legal relations) but also its \"practical\" operation (its \"real or substantive\", i.e. social or economic, effects).  However, the facts in ''Cole v Whitfield'' were relatively simple and the Court soon divided in attempts to apply the criterion of practical operation to more complex facts:  ''[[Bath v Alston Holdings Pty Ltd|Bath v Alston Holdings]]'' (1988) and ''[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia|Castlemaine Tooheys v South Australia]]'' (1990).\n*''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' (1991): Mason was in the 4:3 majority who decided, although for a variety of reasons, that retrospective war crimes legislation applying to events in Europe during World War II was a valid exercise of the external affairs power, Constitution section 51(xxix), and was consistent with the judicial power of the Commonwealth, Constitution ch III.  \n*''[[Eddie Mabo & Ors v The State of Queensland (No.2)|Mabo v Queensland (No.2)]]'' (1992):  the colonialist doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' was superseded by introducing \"[[native title]]\" into Australian law.  The decision provoked allegations of \"judicial activism\", but was soon given statutory form in the [[Native Title Act 1993]] (Cth).\n*''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth|Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth]]'' (1992) and (decided on the same day) ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills|Nationwide News v Wills]]'' (1992):  an important stage in the emergence of a constitutionally implied \"freedom of political communication\".  The Mason Court continued this development until 1994, but it was not to receive unanimous support on the Court until after Mason's departure, in ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997).  This freedom was considered to be implicit in Constitution sections 7 and 24, which provide that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be \"directly chosen by the people\".  However, the Court has remained reluctant to find further implied freedoms.  It has also continued to understand such a \"freedom\" as a limitation upon legislative power and not, at least directly, a personal freedom or right.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George|authorlink= |last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW |isbn=978-1-86287-918-8 }} chs 28\u201329</ref>\n*''[[Dietrich v The Queen]]'' (1992):  an accused is entitled to publicly funded legal representation where that is necessary to a fair trial (Mason among the majority).\n*''[[Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh|Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh]]'' (1995):<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html ''Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh''] [1995] HCA 20; (1995) 183 CLR 273</ref> the high point in Australia of the idea of \"legitimate expectation\", which Mason favoured although in this and other cases other members of the Court criticised it for illogicality and fictionality.

Kerr's 1978 autobiography mentions that he had discussed this possibility with Mason but gives no detail.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 2012, statements in some of Kerr's papers, released by the [[National Archives of Australia|National Archives]], following a request by Professor Jenny Hocking were given publicity in her biography, ''Gough Whitlam: His Time''. Kerr confirms that in 1975 Mason had advised him on whether the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] allows a Governor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister who is unable to obtain supply. Kerr claims that Mason, as well as Chief Justice Sir [[Garfield Barwick]], had advised him that there is such power and that he had followed that advice.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn response, on 27 August 2012 Mason published his own account in major newspapers.<ref name=mason>{{cite web|title=Mason Disputes Details But Largely Confirms Kerr\u2019s Account Of Their Discussions|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/2012/08/27/mason-largely-confirms-kerrs-account-of-discussions.html#more-685|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=2018-03-19}}</ref><ref>The dismissal letter, Kerr's statement of reasons and Barwick's advice are reproduced in {{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George|last2= Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory|year=2014|edition=6|publisher=Federation Press|location=Leichhardt, NSW|isbn=978-1-86287-918-8|pages=361\u201365}}</ref>\n\nMason's account challenges the accuracy and completeness of Kerr's account in several respects, but most importantly on his advice regarding power to dismiss a Prime Minister.  He confirms that as early as August 1975 he had advised Kerr, as a \"close friend\", that the Governor-General does have such power.  He confirms, as Kerr's autobiography had stated although Kerr's papers give a different impression, that he had only advised Kerr on the available courses of action and had not advised him to pursue the course of dismissal.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason also stresses that he had warned Kerr on several occasions and as late as 9 November 1975 that the Governor-General could exercise that power only after notifying the Prime Minister that he would do so if the Prime Minister did not agree to holding a general election.  On 19 November, Mason says, he asked Kerr to ensure that his papers contained that warning, but Kerr did not do that.<ref name=mason/>\n\nHowever, on 11 November 1975 Kerr dismissed Whitlam summarily. Had Kerr notified Whitlam of his intention, Whitlam could have got in first by advising the Queen to dismiss Kerr.  Mason confirms that Kerr was well aware of the danger of what Kerr referred to as a \"race to the Palace\". Indeed, Mason says, Kerr had told him that Whitlam had once raised with him the possibility of such a situation.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason recounts that, in August or soon after in 1975, Kerr had been told by a member of the Prime Minister's department that Whitlam was of the view that, if Kerr were to indicate that he might dismiss Whitlam, Whitlam would advise the Queen to dismiss Kerr. Mason states that at Kerr's request on 9 November he drafted a letter dismissing Whitlam,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hocking|first1=Jenny|title=Snub over 'palace letters' underlines why Australia should ditch the Queen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/mar/19/snub-over-palace-letters-underlines-why-australia-should-ditch-the-queen|accessdate=2018-03-19|work=The Guardian|date=2018-03-19}}</ref> although without consulting him further a \"very different\" text was used.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason says that he had declined to provide Kerr with written advice on his powers, particularly because it would be inappropriate for a Justice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to do so without consulting the Chief Justice. However, at Kerr's request Chief Justice Barwick did provide written advice, which was that he did have power to dismiss a Prime Minister who could not obtain supply and was unwilling to either resign or agree to a general election.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason states that he saw that advice and expressed broad agreement with it. He says that, when Kerr asked him whether, if the matter came to the High Court, Barwick should sit, he had said that he did not know.  He says that Kerr did not ask him what his own position would be in that event.  But he recalls that he had thought it unlikely that the matter would come to the High Court (which had also been Barwick's advice to Kerr).<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason's statement ends:\n:Despite my disagreement with Sir John\u2019s account of events and his decision not to warn the prime minister, I consider that Sir John was subjected to unjustified vilification for making the decision which he made.  I consider and have always considered that Sir John acted consistently with his duty except in so far as he had a duty to warn the prime minister of his intended action and he did not do so.<ref name=mason/>\n\n==Honours==\n* Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1065306&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: CBE]</ref>\n* Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), 22 September 1972<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082325&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: KBE]</ref>\n* [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] (AC), 1988 Australia Day Honours<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=882315&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref>\n* Centenary Medal, 1 January 2001<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1116693&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: Centenary medal]</ref>\n* [[Grand Bauhinia Medal]] (GBM), 1 July 2013<ref>[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201307/01/P201306300691.htm Hong Kong 2013 Honours List]</ref> \n* Honorary doctorates in law from [[Australian National University|ANU]], [[Deakin University|Deakin]], [[Griffith University|Griffith]], [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[Monash University|Monash]], [[University of Sydney|Sydney]], [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of New South Wales|UNSW]] universities.\n* Invested as an Honorary Fellow (HonFAIB) of the Australian Institute of Building (AIB), by the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC( Retd) Governor General of Australia and the AIB's National President adjunct Professor Paul Heather AM FAIB FRSN November 2017 at Western Sydney University in the presence of the Chancellor Professor Peter Shergold AC FRSN.\n* In 2018 elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (Est 1821) and gazetted as such in January 2019 by the then Governor, His Excellency the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Rtd) in the NSW Government Gazette.\n* In 2019 inducted as a  Distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (Est 1821) by its President Professor Ian Sloan AO FRSN and the Governor Her Excellency, the Honourable Margaret Beazley AC QC.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Mason |first1=Anthony |last2=Lindell |first2=Geoffrey (ed)|title=The Mason Papers:  Selected Articles and Speeches by Sir Anthony Mason |location=Leichhardt, NSW |publisher=Federation P. |date=2007 |isbn=978-1862876521 }}\n*{{cite book|last=Pierce |first=Jason L. |title=Inside the Mason Court Revolution:  the High Court of Australia Transformed |location=Durham, NC |publisher=Carolina Academic P. |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59460-061-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n* Sir [[Gerard Brennan]] \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20041222115028/http://www.hcourt.gov.au/speeches/brennanj/brennanj_mason3.htm A Tribute to The Hon.

Mason was more flexible in his attitude to [[precedent]] than many other judges, viewing it more as a policy for consistency than something which would strictly coerce and constrain his decisions.\n\nDuring the years of the \"Mason Court\", a variety of important cases were decided.  These included:\n*''[[Cole v Whitfield]]'' (1988): a landmark decision on the meaning of [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 92.  The unanimous judgment observed (par. 7):\n\n{{quotation|No provision of the Constitution has been the source of greater judicial concern or the subject of greater judicial effort than s.92. That notwithstanding, judicial exegesis of the section has yielded neither clarity of meaning nor certainty of operation. Over the years the Court has moved uneasily between one interpretation and another in its endeavours to solve the problems thrown up by the necessity to apply the very general language of the section to a wide variety of legislative and factual situations. Indeed, these shifts have been such as to make it difficult to speak of the section as having achieved a settled or accepted interpretation at any time since federation. The interpretation which came closest to achieving that degree of acceptance was that embodying the criterion of operation formula which we shall subsequently examine in some detail. That formula appeared to have the advantage of certainty, but that advantage proved to be illusory. Its disadvantage was that it was concerned only with the formal structure of an impugned law and ignored its real or substantive effect.}}\n\n:For the first time, the Constitution was interpreted with systematic reference to records of the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional conventions]] of the 1890s in which the text of the Constitution had been agreed (a good edition of the records had recently appeared).  The Court also examined not only the \"legal\" operation of a law (its effects upon legal relations) but also its \"practical\" operation (its \"real or substantive\", i.e. social or economic, effects).  However, the facts in ''Cole v Whitfield'' were relatively simple and the Court soon divided in attempts to apply the criterion of practical operation to more complex facts:  ''[[Bath v Alston Holdings Pty Ltd|Bath v Alston Holdings]]'' (1988) and ''[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia|Castlemaine Tooheys v South Australia]]'' (1990).\n*''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' (1991): Mason was in the 4:3 majority who decided, although for a variety of reasons, that retrospective war crimes legislation applying to events in Europe during World War II was a valid exercise of the external affairs power, Constitution section 51(xxix), and was consistent with the judicial power of the Commonwealth, Constitution ch III.  \n*''[[Eddie Mabo & Ors v The State of Queensland (No.2)|Mabo v Queensland (No.2)]]'' (1992):  the colonialist doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' was superseded by introducing \"[[native title]]\" into Australian law.  The decision provoked allegations of \"judicial activism\", but was soon given statutory form in the [[Native Title Act 1993]] (Cth).\n*''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth|Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth]]'' (1992) and (decided on the same day) ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills|Nationwide News v Wills]]'' (1992):  an important stage in the emergence of a constitutionally implied \"freedom of political communication\".  The Mason Court continued this development until 1994, but it was not to receive unanimous support on the Court until after Mason's departure, in ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997).  This freedom was considered to be implicit in Constitution sections 7 and 24, which provide that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be \"directly chosen by the people\".  However, the Court has remained reluctant to find further implied freedoms.  It has also continued to understand such a \"freedom\" as a limitation upon legislative power and not, at least directly, a personal freedom or right.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George|authorlink= |last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW |isbn=978-1-86287-918-8 }} chs 28\u201329</ref>\n*''[[Dietrich v The Queen]]'' (1992):  an accused is entitled to publicly funded legal representation where that is necessary to a fair trial (Mason among the majority).\n*''[[Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh|Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh]]'' (1995):<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html ''Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh''] [1995] HCA 20; (1995) 183 CLR 273</ref> the high point in Australia of the idea of \"legitimate expectation\", which Mason favoured although in this and other cases other members of the Court criticised it for illogicality and fictionality.

Kerr's 1978 autobiography mentions that he had discussed this possibility with Mason but gives no detail.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 2012, statements in some of Kerr's papers, released by the [[National Archives of Australia|National Archives]], following a request by Professor Jenny Hocking were given publicity in her biography, ''Gough Whitlam: His Time''. Kerr confirms that in 1975 Mason had advised him on whether the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] allows a Governor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister who is unable to obtain supply. Kerr claims that Mason, as well as Chief Justice Sir [[Garfield Barwick]], had advised him that there is such power and that he had followed that advice.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn response, on 27 August 2012 Mason published his own account in major newspapers.<ref name=mason>{{cite web|title=Mason Disputes Details But Largely Confirms Kerr\u2019s Account Of Their Discussions|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/2012/08/27/mason-largely-confirms-kerrs-account-of-discussions.html#more-685|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=2018-03-19}}</ref><ref>The dismissal letter, Kerr's statement of reasons and Barwick's advice are reproduced in {{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George|last2= Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory|year=2014|edition=6|publisher=Federation Press|location=Leichhardt, NSW|isbn=978-1-86287-918-8|pages=361\u201365}}</ref>\n\nMason's account challenges the accuracy and completeness of Kerr's account in several respects, but most importantly on his advice regarding power to dismiss a Prime Minister.  He confirms that as early as August 1975 he had advised Kerr, as a \"close friend\", that the Governor-General does have such power.  He confirms, as Kerr's autobiography had stated although Kerr's papers give a different impression, that he had only advised Kerr on the available courses of action and had not advised him to pursue the course of dismissal.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason also stresses that he had warned Kerr on several occasions and as late as 9 November 1975 that the Governor-General could exercise that power only after notifying the Prime Minister that he would do so if the Prime Minister did not agree to holding a general election.  On 19 November, Mason says, he asked Kerr to ensure that his papers contained that warning, but Kerr did not do that.<ref name=mason/>\n\nHowever, on 11 November 1975 Kerr dismissed Whitlam summarily. Had Kerr notified Whitlam of his intention, Whitlam could have got in first by advising the Queen to dismiss Kerr.  Mason confirms that Kerr was well aware of the danger of what Kerr referred to as a \"race to the Palace\". Indeed, Mason says, Kerr had told him that Whitlam had once raised with him the possibility of such a situation.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason recounts that, in August or soon after in 1975, Kerr had been told by a member of the Prime Minister's department that Whitlam was of the view that, if Kerr were to indicate that he might dismiss Whitlam, Whitlam would advise the Queen to dismiss Kerr. Mason states that at Kerr's request on 9 November he drafted a letter dismissing Whitlam,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hocking|first1=Jenny|title=Snub over 'palace letters' underlines why Australia should ditch the Queen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/mar/19/snub-over-palace-letters-underlines-why-australia-should-ditch-the-queen|accessdate=2018-03-19|work=The Guardian|date=2018-03-19}}</ref> although without consulting him further a \"very different\" text was used.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason says that he had declined to provide Kerr with written advice on his powers, particularly because it would be inappropriate for a Justice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to do so without consulting the Chief Justice. However, at Kerr's request Chief Justice Barwick did provide written advice, which was that he did have power to dismiss a Prime Minister who could not obtain supply and was unwilling to either resign or agree to a general election.<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason states that he saw that advice and expressed broad agreement with it. He says that, when Kerr asked him whether, if the matter came to the High Court, Barwick should sit, he had said that he did not know.  He says that Kerr did not ask him what his own position would be in that event.  But he recalls that he had thought it unlikely that the matter would come to the High Court (which had also been Barwick's advice to Kerr).<ref name=mason/>\n\nMason's statement ends:\n:Despite my disagreement with Sir John\u2019s account of events and his decision not to warn the prime minister, I consider that Sir John was subjected to unjustified vilification for making the decision which he made.  I consider and have always considered that Sir John acted consistently with his duty except in so far as he had a duty to warn the prime minister of his intended action and he did not do so.<ref name=mason/>\n\n==Honours==\n* Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1065306&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: CBE]</ref>\n* Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), 22 September 1972<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082325&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: KBE]</ref>\n* [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] (AC), 1988 Australia Day Honours<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=882315&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref>\n* Centenary Medal, 1 January 2001<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1116693&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: Centenary medal]</ref>\n* [[Grand Bauhinia Medal]] (GBM), 1 July 2013<ref>[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201307/01/P201306300691.htm Hong Kong 2013 Honours List]</ref> \n* Honorary doctorates in law from [[Australian National University|ANU]], [[Deakin University|Deakin]], [[Griffith University|Griffith]], [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[Monash University|Monash]], [[University of Sydney|Sydney]], [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of New South Wales|UNSW]] universities.\n* Invested as an Honorary Fellow (HonFAIB) of the Australian Institute of Building (AIB), by the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC( Retd) Governor General of Australia and the AIB's National President adjunct Professor Paul Heather AM FAIB FRSN November 2017 at Western Sydney University in the presence of the Chancellor Professor Peter Shergold AC FRSN.\n* In 2018 elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (Est 1821) and gazetted as such in January 2019 by the then Governor, His Excellency the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Rtd) in the NSW Government Gazette.\n* In 2019 inducted as a  Distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (Est 1821) by its President Professor Ian Sloan AO FRSN and the Governor Her Excellency, the Honourable Margaret Beazley AC QC.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Mason |first1=Anthony |last2=Lindell |first2=Geoffrey (ed)|title=The Mason Papers:  Selected Articles and Speeches by Sir Anthony Mason |location=Leichhardt, NSW |publisher=Federation P. |date=2007 |isbn=978-1862876521 }}\n*{{cite book|last=Pierce |first=Jason L. |title=Inside the Mason Court Revolution:  the High Court of Australia Transformed |location=Durham, NC |publisher=Carolina Academic P. |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59460-061-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n* Sir [[Gerard Brennan]] \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20041222115028/http://www.hcourt.gov.au/speeches/brennanj/brennanj_mason3.htm A Tribute to The Hon.

Before area codes were shortened from 4 digit to 2~3 digit in June 2000, there were 1 digit exchange number (usually \"2\") with some 2 digit exchange numbers so some phone numbers like 0347-61-XXXX, 0443-2-XXXX or 0525-40-XXXX existed.

It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he jokingly proposed a story about women's judo, and that lead to his first solo work ''[[Yawara!]]'' (1986\u20131993).<ref name=\"alltheanime\">{{cite web|url = http://nekopop.com/2019/01/naoki-urasawa-interview-creator-monster-20th-century-boys-japan-house-los-angeles-2019/|title = Naoki Urasawa \u2013 Interview with creator of Monster, 20th Century Boys at JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (2019)|publisher = All the Anime|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> \n\nThe original idea for ''Monster'' came from the 1960s American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/> He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/>\n\nThe Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the German one, thus it seemed natural to the author to set ''Monster'' in Germany. [[Post-war]] Germany was chosen so that the [[neo-Nazi]] movement could be included in the story.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite web|url = https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/02/06-1/interview-all-you-need-is-a-white-piece-of-paper-and-pen-a-conversation-with-monster-and-21st-century-boys-creator-naoki-urasawa|title = INTERVIEW: All You Need is a White Piece of Paper and Pen: A Conversation with Monster and 20th Century Boys Creator Naoki Urasawa |date = 2019-02-06|publisher = [[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> When he started ''Monster'' at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing ''[[Happy! (sports manga)|Happy!]]'' and continued to serialize both at the same time. When ''Happy!'' ended in 1999, he began ''[[20th Century Boys]]''. Writing both ''Monster'' and ''20th Century Boys'' at the same time caused him to be briefly hospitalized for exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monster\u2019s Naoki Urasawa Celebrated In Career-Spanning Exhibition |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/monsters-naoki-urasawa-celebrated-in-career-spanning-exhibition/ |publisher=[[Otaku USA]] |date= 2016-02-11 |accessdate=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Monster chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Naoki Urasawa]], ''Monster'' was published in ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' from December 1994 to December 2001.

It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea.

Prison administrators aimed to maintain a safe and orderly environment and rehabilitate the inmates while avoiding the high-profile abuses that occurred at Alcatraz. They implemented a behavior modification program named Control and Rehabilitation Effort (CARE) in 1968.  Inmates in the program spent most of their time in [[solitary confinement]] or in \"group therapy\" sessions where they were berated for their deviant behavior and urged to change.  In 1973, the first blocks of \"control unit\" cells were created.  Inmates assigned to the control-unit would spend 23 to 24 hours a day in one-man cells that were specifically designed to severely limit or eliminate the inmate's contact with other people inside the prison and the outside world.\n\n==Notable incidents==\n\n===High-profile escape attempts===\nThe first escape from USP Marion occurred on October 10, 1975, when five inmates used a homemade electronic device to open the front gates of the prison.  One of them had been an electrician and was assigned to work on the lock mechanisms of all of the doors in the main corridors.  He also converted a radio into a remote control, with which he opened all of the doors.  The five escapees were all eventually captured and returned to prison, the last one being apprehended in Canada on October 31, 1975.\n\nTwo escape attempts occurred in 1978 involving the same inmate, [[Garrett Brock Trapnell]].  On May 24, 1978, Trapnell's friend, 43-year-old Barbara Ann Oswald, hijacked a St. Louis based charter helicopter and ordered the pilot, Allen Barklage, to fly to USP Marion.  Barklage complied, but he wrestled the gun away from Oswald and fatally shot her while he was landing in the prison yard, thwarting the escape. On December 21, 1978, Oswald's 17-year-old daughter, Robin Oswald, hijacked [[TWA Flight 541]], which was en route from [[Louisville International Airport]] to [[Kansas City International Airport]] and threatened to detonate dynamite strapped to her body if the pilot did not fly to [[Williamson County Regional Airport]], located only miles from USP Marion.  When the pilot landed at the airport in Marion, hundreds of law enforcement officers had responded. Robin Oswald surrendered to [[FBI]] negotiators at the Williamson airport without incident about ten hours later.  The dynamite was later found to be fake.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X5-ngmwEdeQC&pg=PA193&dq=%22Robin+Oswald%22#v=onepage&q=%22Robin%20Oswald%22&f=false |title=Prisons and the American Conscience .. |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=July 10, 2011|isbn=9780809320035 |year=1995 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TIM O'NEIL \u2022 toneil@post-dispatch.com > 314-340-8132 |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_1aac5de6-6eb4-5245-a126-7adf324d5eb2.html |title=A Look Back \u2022 Airline hijacking at Lambert in 1972 turns bizarre |publisher=Stltoday.com |date=June 25, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe last escape from the maximum security prison area was on February 14, 1979 when Albert Garza and Howard Zumberge climbed both exterior fences in a dense fog; another prisoner also attempted to escape, but was caught before he could clear the first of the two fences.  Both Garza and Zumberge were apprehended three days later near Cypress, hiding in a church basement. During the capture of the escapees, Garza shot Johnson County Sheriff Elry Faulkner in the chest at almost point-blank range; Faulkner was wearing a bulletproof vest, however and only suffered minor bruises.  Garza was shot and wounded, but survived and returned to Marion two months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/779/390/106252/|title=Albert Garza, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

This method of prison construction and operation involves the keeping of inmates in [[solitary confinement]] for 22 to 23 hours a day, and does not allow communal dining, exercising, or religious services.  These practices were used to keep prisoners under control and prevent prisoners from assaulting other prisoners or prison staff by severely limiting their contact with other people.{{Citation needed|date= March 2014}}\n\nYears later, [[Norman Carlson]], director of the Bureau of Prisons at the time of the Marion incident, said that ordering the permanent lockdown was the only way to deal with \"a very small subset of the inmate population who show absolutely no concern for human life.\"  He pointed out that the two inmates who killed the guards were already serving multiple life sentences, so adding another would have had no effect.  The \"control unit\" model at Marion was later the basis for [[ADX Florence]], which opened in 1994 as a specifically designed supermax prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/12/28/MN42382.DTL|title=The Last Worst Place: The isolation at Colorado's ADX prison is brutal.

Prison administrators aimed to maintain a safe and orderly environment and rehabilitate the inmates while avoiding the high-profile abuses that occurred at Alcatraz. They implemented a behavior modification program named Control and Rehabilitation Effort (CARE) in 1968.  Inmates in the program spent most of their time in [[solitary confinement]] or in \"group therapy\" sessions where they were berated for their deviant behavior and urged to change.  In 1973, the first blocks of \"control unit\" cells were created.  Inmates assigned to the control-unit would spend 23 to 24 hours a day in one-man cells that were specifically designed to severely limit or eliminate the inmate's contact with other people inside the prison and the outside world.\n\n==Notable incidents==\n\n===High-profile escape attempts===\nThe first escape from USP Marion occurred on October 10, 1975, when five inmates used a homemade electronic device to open the front gates of the prison.  One of them had been an electrician and was assigned to work on the lock mechanisms of all of the doors in the main corridors.  He also converted a radio into a remote control, with which he opened all of the doors.  The five escapees were all eventually captured and returned to prison, the last one being apprehended in Canada on October 31, 1975.\n\nTwo escape attempts occurred in 1978 involving the same inmate, [[Garrett Brock Trapnell]].  On May 24, 1978, Trapnell's friend, 43-year-old Barbara Ann Oswald, hijacked a St. Louis based charter helicopter and ordered the pilot, Allen Barklage, to fly to USP Marion.  Barklage complied, but he wrestled the gun away from Oswald and fatally shot her while he was landing in the prison yard, thwarting the escape. On December 21, 1978, Oswald's 17-year-old daughter, Robin Oswald, hijacked [[TWA Flight 541]], which was en route from [[Louisville International Airport]] to [[Kansas City International Airport]] and threatened to detonate dynamite strapped to her body if the pilot did not fly to [[Williamson County Regional Airport]], located only miles from USP Marion.  When the pilot landed at the airport in Marion, hundreds of law enforcement officers had responded. Robin Oswald surrendered to [[FBI]] negotiators at the Williamson airport without incident about ten hours later.  The dynamite was later found to be fake.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X5-ngmwEdeQC&pg=PA193&dq=%22Robin+Oswald%22#v=onepage&q=%22Robin%20Oswald%22&f=false |title=Prisons and the American Conscience .. |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=July 10, 2011|isbn=9780809320035 |year=1995 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TIM O'NEIL \u2022 toneil@post-dispatch.com > 314-340-8132 |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_1aac5de6-6eb4-5245-a126-7adf324d5eb2.html |title=A Look Back \u2022 Airline hijacking at Lambert in 1972 turns bizarre |publisher=Stltoday.com |date=June 25, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe last escape from the maximum security prison area was on February 14, 1979 when Albert Garza and Howard Zumberge climbed both exterior fences in a dense fog; another prisoner also attempted to escape, but was caught before he could clear the first of the two fences.  Both Garza and Zumberge were apprehended three days later near Cypress, hiding in a church basement. During the capture of the escapees, Garza shot Johnson County Sheriff Elry Faulkner in the chest at almost point-blank range; Faulkner was wearing a bulletproof vest, however and only suffered minor bruises.  Garza was shot and wounded, but survived and returned to Marion two months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/779/390/106252/|title=Albert Garza, Plaintiff-appellant, v.

This method of prison construction and operation involves the keeping of inmates in [[solitary confinement]] for 22 to 23 hours a day, and does not allow communal dining, exercising, or religious services.  These practices were used to keep prisoners under control and prevent prisoners from assaulting other prisoners or prison staff by severely limiting their contact with other people.{{Citation needed|date= March 2014}}\n\nYears later, [[Norman Carlson]], director of the Bureau of Prisons at the time of the Marion incident, said that ordering the permanent lockdown was the only way to deal with \"a very small subset of the inmate population who show absolutely no concern for human life.\"  He pointed out that the two inmates who killed the guards were already serving multiple life sentences, so adding another would have had no effect.  The \"control unit\" model at Marion was later the basis for [[ADX Florence]], which opened in 1994 as a specifically designed supermax prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/12/28/MN42382.DTL|title=The Last Worst Place: The isolation at Colorado's ADX prison is brutal.

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas.

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by [[Dharma Mittra]].\n\nAsanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma<ref name=ross /><ref name=hayes /> and diabetes.<ref name=alexander />\n\nAsanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious [[Indian art]] depicts figures of [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]]s in [[lotus position]] and other meditation seats, and in the \"royal ease\" position, [[lalitasana]]. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in [[novels]] and [[films]], and sometimes also in [[advertising]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:Yogi.
