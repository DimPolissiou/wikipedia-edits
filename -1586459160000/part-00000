According to the plans of the Hungarian \"synagogue architect\", [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], it was designed in the late Eclectic-Art Nouveau style at the corner of what is now Hibay K\u00e1roly Street and Kossuth Lajos Street. The building was inaugurated on September 13, 1913. Its form and style are typical of Baumhorn's synagogue architecture, with similarities to the [[Szeged Synagogue|Szeged New Synagogue]] and the [[Novi Sad Synagogue]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The synagogue could not serve the [[Neolog Judaism|neolog]] Jewish community in Eger for a long time, due to its previous decimation during World War II.

According to the plans of the Hungarian \"synagogue architect\", [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], it was designed a late Eclectic-Art Nouveau style at the corner of what is now Hibay K\u00e1roly Street and Kossuth Lajos Street. The building was inaugurated on September 13, 1913. Its form and style are typical of Baumhorn's synagogue architecture, with similarities to the [[Szeged Synagogue|Szeged New Synagogue]] and the [[Novi Sad Synagogue]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The synagogue could not serve the [[Neolog Judaism|neolog]] Jewish community in Eger for a long time, due to its previous decimation during World War II. The building was sold to the city council and used the synagogue as a warehouse until 1967, when it was destroyed. \n\nThe Unicornis Hotel, named for the unicorn in the Eger coat of arms, was opened on October 3, 1969.

In 1204 the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]] was [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked and occupied]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]]rs, an important moment of the Christian [[East\u2013West Schism]]. The Byzantine Empire, already [[Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty|weakened by misrule]], was left divided and in chaos.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}}\n\nTaking advantage of the situation, the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] began seizing territory in Western [[Anatolia]], until the [[Nicaean Empire]] was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the [[Latin Empire]] in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. The position of the Byzantine Empire in Europe remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Serbia]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. This, combined with the reduced power of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Anatolia to maintain Byzantium's grip on [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}\n\nThe weakening of the Sultanate of Rum brought no long-term advantage to the Empire, as nobles known as ''[[ghazis]]'' began setting up fiefdoms at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish [[beys]] participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such bey, [[Osman I]], posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to [[Constantinople]]. Within 90 years of Osman I's establishment of the Ottoman beylik, the Byzantines lost all their Anatolian territory{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} and by 1380, Byzantine Thrace was also lost to the Ottomans. By 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire was nothing more than the [[Despotate of the Morea]], a few [[Aegean islands]], and a strip of land in Thrace in the immediate vicinity of the capital. The [[Crusade of Nicopolis]] in 1396, [[Timur]]'s invasion in 1402 and the final [[Crusade of Varna]] in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until it finally [[Fall of Constantinople|fell in 1453]]. With the conclusion of the war, [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean]] was established.\n\n==Rise of the Ottomans: 1265\u20131328==\n[[File:1263 Mediterranean Sea.svg|thumb|300px|right|East Mediterranean c. 1263.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=162}}{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=93}} KEY:Dark green: Ottoman domain by the 1300s, dotted line indicates conquests up to 1326.Purple: Byzantine Empire.Light green: Turkic lands.Blue: [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilicia]].Red/pink: Latin states]]{{Main|Rise of the Ottoman Empire}}Following [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]' reconquest of [[Constantinople]] in 1261, the Byzantine Empire was left in a grave position. There was plenty of talk among the Latin states of the Greek mainland and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the [[Latin Empire]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}} whilst to the north the main threat came from [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian]] expansion into the Balkans by king [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]].{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=260}}\n\nWhat was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself. To solve these problems Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had the younger co-emperor [[John IV Laskaris|John IV]] blinded, which resulted in much resentment.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}} To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Germanus III of Constantinople|Germanus III]], ordering him to lift an [[excommunication]] that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch [[Arsenios Autoreianos]] and to submit to the authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}}As the Byzantine Empire continued the conquest of [[Latinokratia|Latin territory]], the Turks under Osman I began their raids into Byzantine Anatolia; [[S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]] were taken in 1265 and 1289 respectively.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}} Michael Palaeologus was unable to deal with these early setbacks due to the need to transfer troops to the West.In 1282, Michael Palaeologus died and his son [[Andronicus II]] took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin appeasement to the [[Catholic Church|Church in Rome]], heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2006}}\n\nAndronicus' rule was marked by incompetence and short-sighted decisions that in the long run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine ''[[hyperpyron]]'', resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the ''Powerful'', i.e. [[landed aristocracy]] and instead placed upon the Knight-class ''[[Pronoia]]''. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}\nAndronicus II took a deep interest in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}} The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding and the end of his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son [[Michael IX]] and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at [[Magnesia ad Sipylum|Magnesia]] and [[Battle of Bapheus|Bapheus]] in 1302.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}Despite this, Andronicus tried once more to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the guidance of Michael IX and the leadership of [[Roger de Flor]], the 6,500-strong [[Catalan Company]] in the spring and summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] to [[Cyzicus]], in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}The Ottomans were able to build on their military success due to the numerous divisions amongst their opponents. Many of the peasant classes in Anatolia saw the Ottomans as the better master.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2006}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=179}}\n\n[[File:1328 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Byzantine Empire at the time of Andronicus III's assumption of power{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=41}}]]\nAfter these defeats, Andronicus was in no position to send substantial forces. In 1320, Andronicus II's grandson, [[Andronicus III]], was disinherited following the death of his father, Michael IX, the Emperor's son and heir apparent.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=262}} The following year, Andronicus III retaliated by marching on Constantinople and was given Thrace as an [[appanage]]. He kept on pressing for his inheritance and, in 1322, was made co-emperor. This culminated in the [[Byzantine civil war of 1321\u20131328]], in which Serbia backed Andronicus II and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] backed his grandson. Eventually Andronicus III emerged triumphant on May 23, 1328. As Andronicus III consolidated his hold on Byzantium, the Ottomans succeeded in taking [[Bursa]] from the Byzantines in 1326.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}\n\n==Byzantium counter: 1328\u20131341==\n{{Main|Siege of Nicomedia}}\n[[File:OttomanHorseArcher.jpg|thumb|right|The Ottoman Sultanate operated vast numbers of skilled troops and conscripts.]]\nAndronicus III's reign was to be marked by Byzantium's last genuine and promising attempt at restoring \"the glory that was once [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]\". In 1329, Byzantine troops were sent to meet the Ottoman forces{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} who had been blockading, and in effect laying siege to, Nicaea since 1301.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} Byzantine [[Catalan Campaign (Asia Minor)|counter-attacks]] coupled with the scale of Nicaea's defenses had frustrated the Ottomans' attempts at taking any cities. The fate of Nicaea was sealed when the Byzantine relief army was defeated at [[Battle of Pelekanon|Pelekanos]] on 10 June 1329.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} In 1331, Nicaea surrendered,{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} resulting in a massive blow considering that it was the capital of the Empire 70 years prior.\n\nOnce again the Byzantines' military power was depleted and Andronicus III was forced into diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; in return for the safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}}\n\nDespite these setbacks, Andronicus III was able to score a few successes against his opponents in Greece and Asia Minor; [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] along with [[Thessalonika]] were subjugated.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} In 1329, the Byzantines captured [[Chios]] and, in 1335, secured [[Lesbos]]. Nonetheless, these isolated Islands were isolated exceptions to the general trend of increasing Ottoman conquests. Furthermore, none of the Islands were a part of the Ottoman domain; their capture demonstrates the potential that the Byzantines had at the time of Andronicus III. Byzantine military ability would be further weakened by Serbian expansions{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} into recent acquisitions by Andronicus III (Epirus) and finally by a devastating civil war that would subjugate the Byzantine Empire as a vassal to the Ottomans.\n\n==Balkan invasion and civil war: 1341\u20131371==\n[[File:Byzantine empire 1355.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Balkans and Anatolia in ca. 1355.

Rivalries between Kalekas and Cantacuzenus led to a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|destructive civil war]], in which Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant at Constantinople in February 1347. During this time [[bubonic plague|plague]], earthquakes{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=266}} and Ottoman raiding continued until only [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] remained in Byzantine hands and only so by payment of a tribute. Throughout the civil war the Byzantines on both sides employed Turks and Serbs with mercenaries pillaging at will,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=267}} leaving much of Macedonia in ruin and in the hands of the newly created [[Serbian Empire]]. Following this victory, Kantakouzenos ruled as co-emperor with John V.\n\nThis dual rule eventually failed and the two waged a [[Byzantine civil war of 1352\u20131357|new civil war]] further diminishing what was left of Byzantium's integrity in the eyes of her troublesome neighbors. John VI Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant once again and replaced the now exiled John V Palaeologus with his son [[Matthew Cantacuzenus]] as junior co-emperor. However, the Turks, under Osman I's son, [[Orhan I]], now came into play by capturing the fort of Kallipolis ([[Gallipoli]]) in 1354{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=182}} and gaining access to the European mainland. The arrival of the seemingly unbeatable Ottoman soldiers surrounding Constantinople caused a panic in Constantinople, capitalized by John V who, with the assistance of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], staged a coup and ousted John VI Cantacuzenus in November 1354. As a result, John VI would later become a monk.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}\n\nThe civil war did not end there; Matthew Cantacuzenus now obtained troops from Orhan and began a bid for taking Constantinople. His capture in 1356 ended his dreams of becoming Emperor and with it came an ephemeral defeat for the Ottomans who had favored the overthrow of John V.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}\n\nFollowing the end of the civil conflict came a small lull in fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 [[Didymoteichon]] fell to the Turks.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}} Orhan's successor, [[Murad I]] was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like [[Alp Arslan]] of the [[Seljuk Turks]], Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] falling after major campaigning between 1363\u20134 and Adrianople [[Battle of Adrianople (1365)|succumbing]] to the Ottomans in 1369.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=269}}\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was in no position to launch any decent counter-attack or defence of these lands; by now the Ottomans had become supremely powerful. Murad I crushed an army of Serbians on 26 September 1371 at the [[Battle of Maritsa]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=269}} leading to the end of Serbian power. The Ottomans were now poised to conquer Constantinople. In an attempt to stave off defeat, John V appealed to the Pope for support offering submission to Rome in return for military support. Despite publicly confessing the Roman Catholic Faith in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], John V received no help. John V therefore was forced to turn to reason with his enemies, the Ottomans. Murad I and John V then came to an agreement whereby Byzantium would provide regular tribute in troops and money in exchange for security.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}}\n\n==Byzantine civil war and vassalage: 1371\u20131394==\nBy now the Ottomans had essentially won the war; Byzantium was reduced to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=264}} This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their thrust into the Balkans, proving to be great conquerors in Europe as they were in Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} and [[Ni\u0161]] was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the [[Battle of Kosovo (1389)|Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by [[Bayezid I]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when [[Vidin]] fell.\n\n[[File:1389 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Map of the Middle East c.1389.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}} Byzantium (purple) consists of little other than Constantinople. Following the occupation of [[Fall of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]], the Ottomans (Dark Green) rapidly spread across the Balkans, annexing southern parts of Serbia in the northwest and giving them a major advantage over their Turkic (Green) rivals in Anatolia.]]\nOttoman advances into the Balkans were aided by further Byzantine civil conflict \u2014 this time between [[John V Palaeologus]] and his eldest son [[Andronicus IV]].{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} With Ottoman aid from Murad I, John V was able to [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blind]] Andronikus IV and his son [[John VII Palaeologus]] in September 1373. Andronicus escaped with his son and secured Murad's aid by promising a higher tribute than John V's.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=271}} The civil strife continued as late as September 1390 though potential for conflict continued until 1408. John V eventually forgave Andronicus IV and his son in 1381, angering his second son and [[heir apparent]], [[Manuel II Palaeologus]]. He seized [[Thessalonika]], alarming the Ottoman Sultan in liberating parts of Greece from Ottoman rule.\n\nThe death of Andronicus IV in 1385 and the capitulation of Thessalonika in 1387 to Hayreddin Pasha encouraged Manuel II Palaeologus to seek the forgiveness of the Sultan and John V. His increasingly close relationship with John V angered John VII who saw his right as the heir threatened. John VII launched a coup against John V but despite Ottoman and Genoese aid his reign lasted mere five months before he was toppled by Manuel II and his father.\n\n===Fall of Philadelphia===\nWhilst the civil war was raging, the Turks in Anatolia took the opportunity to seize Philadelphia in 1390, marking the end of Byzantine rule in Anatolia, although by now the city was far from Imperial rule. The city had long been under only nominal Imperial rule and its fall was of little strategic consequence to the Byzantines \u2013 whose Emperor had to suffer the humiliation of accompanying the Sultan during the campaign.\n\n===Vassalage===\nFollowing John V's death, Manuel II Palaeologus was able to secure his throne and establish good relations with the Sultan, becoming his vassal. In return for Ottoman acceptance of his reign Manuel II was forced to dismantle the fortifications at the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], something that he did not take lightly to.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}}\n\n==Resumption of hostilities: 1394\u20131424==\nIn 1394, relations between the Byzantines and the Ottomans changed for the worse and the war between the two resumed when the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (ruled 1389\u20131402) ordered the execution of Manuel II{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}} after the Emperor attempted to reconcile with his nephew John VII. The Ottoman Sultan then later changed his decision and demanded that a [[mosque]] and a Turkish colony be established in Constantinople.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}} Manuel II not only refused this, he also refused to pay the Sultan tribute and went so far as to ignore the Sultan's messages, leading to a siege of the city in 1394. Manuel II called for a Crusade, which came in 1396. Under the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]],{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=184}} the Crusade was [[Battle of Nicopolis|crushed]] at Nicopolis in 1396.\n[[File:Timur Exhumed.gif|thumb|left|Despite his persecution of Christians,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=61}} [[Timur]] saved Constantinople.]]\nThe defeat convinced Manuel II to escape the city and travel to Western Europe for aid.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=274}} During this time the reconciled John VII led the city's successful defence against the Ottomans. The siege was finally broken when [[Timur]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai Mongols]] led an army into Anatolia, dismantling the network of [[beyliks]] loyal to the Ottoman Sultan. At the [[Battle of Ankara]], Timur's forces routed Bayezid I's forces, a shocking defeat for which no one was prepared. In the aftermath, the Ottoman Turks began fighting each other led by Bayezid's sons.{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=167}}\n\nThe Byzantines wasted no time exploiting the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}} By signing the treaty, they were able to recover Thessalonika and much of the Peloponnese. The [[Ottoman Interregnum|Ottoman civil war]] ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, with the support of the Byzantine Empire, defeated his opponents.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}}\n\n[[File:Tornese Andronicus II.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Along with the humiliation, the Byzantine tribute to the Ottomans of 300,000 silver coins would have been all the more difficult with the economy [[Byzantine economy#Constantinople.27s wealth|in decline.]]]]\nThe rare amity established between the two states would not last; the death of Mehmed I and the rise of [[Murad II]] in 1421 coupled with the ascent of [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]] to the Byzantine throne led to a deteriorated change in relations between the two. Neither leader was content with the status quo. John VIII made the first and foolish move by inciting a rebellion in the Ottoman Empire: a certain Mustafa had been released by the Byzantines and claimed that he was Bayezid's lost son.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}}\n\nDespite the odds, a sizable force had mustered in Europe under his banner, defeating Murad II's subordinates. Murad II's furious reply eventually smashed this upstart and, in 1422, began the [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|Siege of Thessalonica]] and Constantinople.{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=167}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}} John VIII then turned to his aging father, Manuel II, for advice. The result was that he incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks \u2014 this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, [[Kucuk Mustafa]]. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with Bursa coming under siege. After a [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|failed assault on Constantinople]], Murad II was forced to turn back his army and defeat Kucuk. With these defeats, the Byzantines were forced once more into vassalage \u2014 300,000 coins of silver were to be delivered to the Sultan as tribute on an annual basis.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=276}}\n\n==Ottoman victory 1424\u20131453==\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|250px|left|The Ottoman Empire in 1451. By this point all of Byzantium's major cities had fallen to the Ottomans who occupied almost half of Anatolia and most of the Balkans]]\nThe Ottomans faced numerous opponents between 1424 and 1453. Tied down by the [[Siege of Thessalonika (1422)|siege of Thessalonika]], the Ottomans had to contend with the Serbs under [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107|George Brankovic]], the Hungarians under [[John Hunyadi]] and the Albanians under [[Skanderbeg|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=184}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=279}} This resistance culminated into the [[Crusade of Varna]] of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception \u2013 a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians \u2013 was defeated.\n\nIn 1448 and 1451, there was a change in the Byzantine and Ottoman leaderships, respectively. Murad II died and was succeeded by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] whilst [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] succeeded John VIII. Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well; the former's successful conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter, who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region, and Mehmed had around 40,000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains. Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=280}} regarding the status quo. Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance. The Ottomans already controlled the land around Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453. Despite a union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the Byzantines received no official aid from the Pope or Western Europe, with the exception of a few soldiers from Venice and Genoa.\n\nEngland and France were in the concluding stages of the [[Hundred Years War]]. The French did not wish to lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was in the final stages of the [[Reconquista]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]], never centralized enough behind the [[Hohenstaufen]] to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the [[Hussite wars]] seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the [[Polish\u2013Teutonic Wars]] kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nOther than these major European powers, the only others were the [[Italian maritime republics|Italian city-states]]. Genoa and Venice were both enemies of the Ottomans, but also of each other. The Venetians considered sending their fleet up to attack the fortifications guarding the [[Dardanelles]] and the Bosporus, thereby relieving the city but the force was too small and arrived too late. The Ottomans would have overpowered any military assistance provided by one city, even one as large and powerful as the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. In any case some 2,000 mercenaries, mostly Italian under [[Giovanni Giustiniani Longo]],{{sfn|Sherrard|1967||p=168}} arrived to assist in the defence of the city. The city's entire defence fell to these mercenaries and 5,000 militia soldiers raised from a city whose population had been seriously eroded by heavy taxation, plague and civil conflict.{{sfn|Mango|2002}} Though poorly trained, the defenders were well armed with many weapons,{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=168}} except for any cannons to match the Ottoman's own artillery.\n\n[[File:Aya sofya.jpg|left|thumb|The city's largest church, the [[Hagia Sophia]] was converted into a mosque.

As the Ottomans continued their seemingly unsuccessful and costly assaults, many in their camp began to doubt the success of the siege; history had shown the city to be invincible to Ottoman siege.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In an effort to raise morale, the Sultan then made a speech{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=169}} reminding his troops of the vast wealth and pillaging of the city to come. An all-out assault captured the city on May 29, 1453. As the Ottomans fanned out to sack the city, their naval discipline began to collapse and many Genoans and Venetians escaped in vessels from the city, including [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]],{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=123}} a Venetian surgeon present at the siege who wrote:\n\n{{cquote|All through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city. The blood flowed in the city like rainwater after a sudden storm, and the corpses of Turks and Christians were thrown into the Dardanelles, where they floated out to sea like melons along a canal.|20|20|}}\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|right|Byzantium's last years saw the loss of recent territories]]\nAfter the siege, the Ottomans went on to take [[Despotate of Morea|Morea]] in 1460, and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] in 1461.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=283}} With the fall of Trebizond came the end of the Roman Empire; the [[Palaeologan dynasty]] continued to be recognized as the rightful emperors of Constantinople by the crowned heads of Europe until the 16th century when the [[Reformation]], the Ottoman threat to Europe and decreased interest in crusading forced European powers to recognize the Ottoman Empire as masters of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]]. After the [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|Fall of Trebizond]] also the [[Principality of Theodoro|Theodoro]] in 1475 and with [[Vonitsa]] the [[Despotate of Epirus]] in 1479{{sfn|Fine|1987|p=563}} were conquered by the Ottomans.\n\n==Causes of the Byzantine defeat==\n\n===Latin intervention===\nThe Latin presence in the Balkans seriously undermined the Byzantines' ability to coordinate their efforts against the Ottoman Turks. This is exemplified by [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], whose attempts to drive the Latins out of Greece led to the abandonment of the Anatolian borders which allowed several beyliks, as well as the Turks of Osman I to raid and settle former Byzantine lands. Andronicus II's campaigns in Anatolia, though it obtained some military success, was constantly thwarted by events in the west of the Empire.{{sfn|Mango|2002}} In any event, the Byzantines were forced to choose between Papal and Latin threat of attack or an unpopular union, which was exploited by numerous rival claimants as cause for a [[coup]] against the Byzantine Emperor.\n\n[[File:Last Crusader.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Romantic portrayal of the \"Last Crusader\". Increasing Muslim victories, Christian defeats and European transgressions coupled with the Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to the end of the Crusades.]]\nNonetheless, towards the mid- and late-14th century, the Byzantines began to receive nominal aid from the West. This was little more than sympathy toward a fellow-Christian power fighting a Muslim power and despite two Crusades, the Byzantines \"received as much help from Rome as we did from the [Mamluk] sultan [of Egypt].\"{{sfn|Madden|2005}} The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in the 13th century had been one of the most determined powers to remove Christian influence in the Middle East and raiding by Cyprus did not change this in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n===Byzantine weakness===\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines were left in an unstable position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time \u2014 the weakening of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] resulted in many [[beyliks]] breaking away as autonomous states, such as the [[Ottoman Emirate|Emirate]] founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the [[Empire of Nicaea]] a temporary free hand, it was nothing more than a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.{{opinion|date=June 2019}}{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn order to implement these Greek re-conquests, Michael VIII was forced to levy crushing taxes on the Anatolian peasantry{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=179}} in order to pay for the expensive army that modeled around the [[Komnenian army]]. This led to much peasant support for the Turks whose system resulted in fewer taxes initially.\n\nAfter Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines suffered from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much later on in the 15th century; by that time, the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341\u201371) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Ottoman strengths===\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.Sipahis.jpg|left|thumb|The Ottomans combined several different fighting methods and technologies. These Sipahis were exactly unique for western knights due to their weapons and battlefield experiments.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}]]\nThe Ottomans had great diplomatic skill and ability to raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines,{{sfn|Turnbull|2003|p=12}} they were able to exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.\n\nIt was the Ottomans' skill with dealing with their opponents that made them very powerful very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states in the form of children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Consequences==\nThe [[fall of Constantinople]] came as a shock to the papacy, which ordered an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade. Only [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]] responded but under the condition that a powerful monarch assist him; however, none would do so.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=189}} [[Pope Pius II]] then ordered another crusade. Again, no substantial efforts were seen by any of Europe's major leaders of the time. This forced the Pope himself to lead a crusade. His death in 1464 led to the disbanding of the crusade at the port of [[Ancona]].{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=189}}\n\nThe Fall also had many implications in Europe: the influx of Greek science and culture into Europe by those escaping the Ottomans was a crucial factor in catalyzing the European [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe failed attempts at defeating the Ottomans at [[Crusade of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]] and [[Crusade of Varna|Varna]], the loss of the [[Holy Land]] (without Byzantium the Crusades could not re-supply en route) and the lack of a genuine counter-attack led many, including [[Martin Luther]], into believing that the Turks were God's punishment against the sins of Christians:\n<blockquote>''How shamefully...the pope has this long time baited us with the war against the Turks, taken our money, destroyed so many Christians and made so much mischief!\"{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=193}}</blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, by 1529, Europe began to rise to the threat of the Ottomans. Martin Luther, changing his views, wrote that the \"Scourge of God\"{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=193}} had to be fought with great vigour by secular leaders rather than as Crusades initiated by the Papacy.\n\nWith the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople ''[[de facto]]'' recognized by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans went on to facilitate further [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquests in Europe]] and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austrian]] attempts to contain the Ottoman threat became more and more a formality until the official dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] after [[World War I]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Byzantine Empire|War}}\n* [[Byzantine empire]]\n* [[Ottoman empire]]\n* [[Ottoman Navy]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n* [[Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars]]\n* [[List of conflicts in the Middle East]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Bartusis |first=Mark C. |title=The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204\u20131453 |year=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-1620-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Jerry H.|last2=Ziegler|first2=Herbert F.|title=Traditions & Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZlMwwEACAAJ|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-299835-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|title=The late medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the late twelfth century to the Ottoman Conquest|url=https://archive.org/details/latemedievalbalk00fine|url-access=registration|date=January 1987|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-10079-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Grant |first=R.G. |title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |ref=harv |isbn=0756613604 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/battlevisualjour0000gran_e3z7 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Laiou |first=Angeliki E. |title=Constantinople and the Latins: The Foreign Policy of Andronicus II, 1282\u20131328 |year=1972 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-16535-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Madden|first=Thomas F.|title=Crusades: The Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eudAAAACAAJ|date=12 September 2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-03127-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Mango |first=Cyril |title=The Oxford History of Byzantium |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford UP|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Nicol |first=Donald MacGillivray |title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261\u20131453 |year=1993 |authorlink=Donald Nicol |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43991-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Parker |first=Geoffrey |title=Compact history of the world |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=Times Books|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Johnathan |year=2004 |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/crusades/fourth-crusade-and-sack-constantinople|title=The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople &#124;

In 1204 the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]] was [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked and occupied]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]]rs, an important moment of the Christian [[East\u2013West Schism]]. The Byzantine Empire, already [[Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty|weakened by misrule]], was left divided and in chaos.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}}\n\nTaking advantage of the situation, the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] began seizing territory in Western [[Anatolia]], until the [[Nicaean Empire]] was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the [[Latin Empire]] in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. The position of the Byzantine Empire in Europe remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Serbia]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. This, combined with the reduced power of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Anatolia to maintain Byzantium's grip on [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}\n\nThe weakening of the Sultanate of Rum brought no long-term advantage to the Empire, as nobles known as ''[[ghazis]]'' began setting up fiefdoms at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish [[beys]] participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such bey, [[Osman I]], posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to [[Constantinople]]. Within 90 years of Osman I's establishment of the Ottoman beylik, the Byzantines lost all their Anatolian territory{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} and by 1380, Byzantine Thrace was also lost to the Ottomans. By 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire was nothing more than the [[Despotate of the Morea]], a few [[Aegean islands]], and a strip of land in Thrace in the immediate vicinity of the capital. The [[Crusade of Nicopolis]] in 1396, [[Timur]]'s invasion in 1402 and the final [[Crusade of Varna]] in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until it finally [[Fall of Constantinople|fell in 1453]]. With the conclusion of the war, [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean]] was established.\n\n==Rise of the Ottomans: 1265\u20131328==\n[[File:1263 Mediterranean Sea.svg|thumb|300px|right|East Mediterranean c. 1263.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=162}}{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=93}} KEY:Dark green: Ottoman domain by the 1300s, dotted line indicates conquests up to 1326.Purple: Byzantine Empire.Light green: Turkic lands.Blue: [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilicia]].Red/pink: Latin states]]{{Main|Rise of the Ottoman Empire}}Following [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]' reconquest of [[Constantinople]] in 1261, the Byzantine Empire was left in a grave position. There was plenty of talk among the Latin states of the Greek mainland and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the [[Latin Empire]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}} whilst to the north the main threat came from [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian]] expansion into the Balkans by king [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]].{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=260}}\n\nWhat was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself. To solve these problems Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had the younger co-emperor [[John IV Laskaris|John IV]] blinded, which resulted in much resentment.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}} To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Germanus III of Constantinople|Germanus III]], ordering him to lift an [[excommunication]] that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch [[Arsenios Autoreianos]] and to submit to the authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=255&ndash;57}}As the Byzantine Empire continued the conquest of [[Latinokratia|Latin territory]], the Turks under Osman I began their raids into Byzantine Anatolia; [[S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]] were taken in 1265 and 1289 respectively.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}} Michael Palaeologus was unable to deal with these early setbacks due to the need to transfer troops to the West.In 1282, Michael Palaeologus died and his son [[Andronicus II]] took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin appeasement to the [[Catholic Church|Church in Rome]], heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2006}}\n\nAndronicus' rule was marked by incompetence and short-sighted decisions that in the long run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine ''[[hyperpyron]]'', resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the ''Powerful'', i.e. [[landed aristocracy]] and instead placed upon the Knight-class ''[[Pronoia]]''. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}\nAndronicus II took a deep interest in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}} The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding and the end of his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son [[Michael IX]] and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at [[Magnesia ad Sipylum|Magnesia]] and [[Battle of Bapheus|Bapheus]] in 1302.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}Despite this, Andronicus tried once more to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the guidance of Michael IX and the leadership of [[Roger de Flor]], the 6,500-strong [[Catalan Company]] in the spring and summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] to [[Cyzicus]], in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=260&ndash;61}}The Ottomans were able to build on their military success due to the numerous divisions amongst their opponents. Many of the peasant classes in Anatolia saw the Ottomans as the better master.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2006}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=179}}\n\n[[File:1328 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Byzantine Empire at the time of Andronicus III's assumption of power{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=41}}]]\nAfter these defeats, Andronicus was in no position to send substantial forces. In 1320, Andronicus II's grandson, [[Andronicus III]], was disinherited following the death of his father, Michael IX, the Emperor's son and heir apparent.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=262}} The following year, Andronicus III retaliated by marching on Constantinople and was given Thrace as an [[appanage]]. He kept on pressing for his inheritance and, in 1322, was made co-emperor. This culminated in the [[Byzantine civil war of 1321\u20131328]], in which Serbia backed Andronicus II and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] backed his grandson. Eventually Andronicus III emerged triumphant on May 23, 1328. As Andronicus III consolidated his hold on Byzantium, the Ottomans succeeded in taking [[Bursa]] from the Byzantines in 1326.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}\n\n==Byzantium counter: 1328\u20131341==\n{{Main|Siege of Nicomedia}}\n[[File:OttomanHorseArcher.jpg|thumb|right|The Ottoman Sultanate operated vast numbers of skilled troops and conscripts.]]\nAndronicus III's reign was to be marked by Byzantium's last genuine and promising attempt at restoring \"the glory that was once [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]\". In 1329, Byzantine troops were sent to meet the Ottoman forces{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} who had been blockading, and in effect laying siege to, Nicaea since 1301.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} Byzantine [[Catalan Campaign (Asia Minor)|counter-attacks]] coupled with the scale of Nicaea's defenses had frustrated the Ottomans' attempts at taking any cities. The fate of Nicaea was sealed when the Byzantine relief army was defeated at [[Battle of Pelekanon|Pelekanos]] on 10 June 1329.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} In 1331, Nicaea surrendered,{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}} resulting in a massive blow considering that it was the capital of the Empire 70 years prior.\n\nOnce again the Byzantines' military power was depleted and Andronicus III was forced into diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; in return for the safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}}\n\nDespite these setbacks, Andronicus III was able to score a few successes against his opponents in Greece and Asia Minor; [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] along with [[Thessalonika]] were subjugated.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} In 1329, the Byzantines captured [[Chios]] and, in 1335, secured [[Lesbos]]. Nonetheless, these isolated Islands were isolated exceptions to the general trend of increasing Ottoman conquests. Furthermore, none of the Islands were a part of the Ottoman domain; their capture demonstrates the potential that the Byzantines had at the time of Andronicus III. Byzantine military ability would be further weakened by Serbian expansions{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=263}} into recent acquisitions by Andronicus III (Epirus) and finally by a devastating civil war that would subjugate the Byzantine Empire as a vassal to the Ottomans.\n\n==Balkan invasion and civil war: 1341\u20131371==\n[[File:Byzantine empire 1355.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Balkans and Anatolia in ca. 1355. Byzantium has lost her cities in Asia Minor and Macedonia and Epirus have been conquered by Dushan's Serbia, while the nascent [[Ottoman emirate]] has consolidated its hold over [[Bithynia]]]]\n\nAndronicus III died in 1341 leaving his 10-year-old son [[John V Palaiologos|John V]] to rule.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=265}} A regency was set up with [[John Cantacuzenus]], the young Emperor's mother, [[Anna of Savoy]], and the Patriarch [[John XIV Kalekas]]. Rivalries between Kalekas and Cantacuzenus led to a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|destructive civil war]], in which Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant at Constantinople in February 1347. During this time [[bubonic plague|plague]], earthquakes{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=266}} and Ottoman raiding continued until only [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] remained in Byzantine hands and only so by payment of a tribute. Throughout the civil war the Byzantines on both sides employed Turks and Serbs with mercenaries pillaging at will,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=267}} leaving much of Macedonia in ruin and in the hands of the newly created [[Serbian Empire]]. Following this victory, Kantakouzenos ruled as co-emperor with John V.\n\nThis dual rule eventually failed and the two waged a [[Byzantine civil war of 1352\u20131357|new civil war]] further diminishing what was left of Byzantium's integrity in the eyes of her troublesome neighbors. John VI Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant once again and replaced the now exiled John V Palaeologus with his son [[Matthew Cantacuzenus]] as junior co-emperor. However, the Turks, under Osman I's son, [[Orhan I]], now came into play by capturing the fort of Kallipolis ([[Gallipoli]]) in 1354{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=182}} and gaining access to the European mainland. The arrival of the seemingly unbeatable Ottoman soldiers surrounding Constantinople caused a panic in Constantinople, capitalized by John V who, with the assistance of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], staged a coup and ousted John VI Cantacuzenus in November 1354. As a result, John VI would later become a monk.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}\n\nThe civil war did not end there; Matthew Cantacuzenus now obtained troops from Orhan and began a bid for taking Constantinople. His capture in 1356 ended his dreams of becoming Emperor and with it came an ephemeral defeat for the Ottomans who had favored the overthrow of John V.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}}\n\nFollowing the end of the civil conflict came a small lull in fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 [[Didymoteichon]] fell to the Turks.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=268}} Orhan's successor, [[Murad I]] was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like [[Alp Arslan]] of the [[Seljuk Turks]], Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] falling after major campaigning between 1363\u20134 and Adrianople [[Battle of Adrianople (1365)|succumbing]] to the Ottomans in 1369.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=269}}\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was in no position to launch any decent counter-attack or defence of these lands; by now the Ottomans had become supremely powerful. Murad I crushed an army of Serbians on 26 September 1371 at the [[Battle of Maritsa]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=269}} leading to the end of Serbian power. The Ottomans were now poised to conquer Constantinople. In an attempt to stave off defeat, John V appealed to the Pope for support offering submission to Rome in return for military support. Despite publicly confessing the Roman Catholic Faith in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], John V received no help. John V therefore was forced to turn to reason with his enemies, the Ottomans. Murad I and John V then came to an agreement whereby Byzantium would provide regular tribute in troops and money in exchange for security.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}}\n\n==Byzantine civil war and vassalage: 1371\u20131394==\nBy now the Ottomans had essentially won the war; Byzantium was reduced to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=264}} This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their thrust into the Balkans, proving to be great conquerors in Europe as they were in Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} and [[Ni\u0161]] was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the [[Battle of Kosovo (1389)|Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by [[Bayezid I]]{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when [[Vidin]] fell.\n\n[[File:1389 Mediterranean Sea.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Map of the Middle East c.1389.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=70&ndash;1}} Byzantium (purple) consists of little other than Constantinople. Following the occupation of [[Fall of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]], the Ottomans (Dark Green) rapidly spread across the Balkans, annexing southern parts of Serbia in the northwest and giving them a major advantage over their Turkic (Green) rivals in Anatolia.]]\nOttoman advances into the Balkans were aided by further Byzantine civil conflict \u2014 this time between [[John V Palaeologus]] and his eldest son [[Andronicus IV]].{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} With Ottoman aid from Murad I, John V was able to [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blind]] Andronikus IV and his son [[John VII Palaeologus]] in September 1373. Andronicus escaped with his son and secured Murad's aid by promising a higher tribute than John V's.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=271}} The civil strife continued as late as September 1390 though potential for conflict continued until 1408. John V eventually forgave Andronicus IV and his son in 1381, angering his second son and [[heir apparent]], [[Manuel II Palaeologus]]. He seized [[Thessalonika]], alarming the Ottoman Sultan in liberating parts of Greece from Ottoman rule.\n\nThe death of Andronicus IV in 1385 and the capitulation of Thessalonika in 1387 to Hayreddin Pasha encouraged Manuel II Palaeologus to seek the forgiveness of the Sultan and John V. His increasingly close relationship with John V angered John VII who saw his right as the heir threatened. John VII launched a coup against John V but despite Ottoman and Genoese aid his reign lasted mere five months before he was toppled by Manuel II and his father.\n\n===Fall of Philadelphia===\nWhilst the civil war was raging, the Turks in Anatolia took the opportunity to seize Philadelphia in 1390, marking the end of Byzantine rule in Anatolia, although by now the city was far from Imperial rule. The city had long been under only nominal Imperial rule and its fall was of little strategic consequence to the Byzantines \u2013 whose Emperor had to suffer the humiliation of accompanying the Sultan during the campaign.\n\n===Vassalage===\nFollowing John V's death, Manuel II Palaeologus was able to secure his throne and establish good relations with the Sultan, becoming his vassal. In return for Ottoman acceptance of his reign Manuel II was forced to dismantle the fortifications at the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], something that he did not take lightly to.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}}\n\n==Resumption of hostilities: 1394\u20131424==\nIn 1394, relations between the Byzantines and the Ottomans changed for the worse and the war between the two resumed when the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (ruled 1389\u20131402) ordered the execution of Manuel II{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}} after the Emperor attempted to reconcile with his nephew John VII. The Ottoman Sultan then later changed his decision and demanded that a [[mosque]] and a Turkish colony be established in Constantinople.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=273}} Manuel II not only refused this, he also refused to pay the Sultan tribute and went so far as to ignore the Sultan's messages, leading to a siege of the city in 1394. Manuel II called for a Crusade, which came in 1396. Under the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]],{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=184}} the Crusade was [[Battle of Nicopolis|crushed]] at Nicopolis in 1396.\n[[File:Timur Exhumed.gif|thumb|left|Despite his persecution of Christians,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=61}} [[Timur]] saved Constantinople.]]\nThe defeat convinced Manuel II to escape the city and travel to Western Europe for aid.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=274}} During this time the reconciled John VII led the city's successful defence against the Ottomans. The siege was finally broken when [[Timur]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai Mongols]] led an army into Anatolia, dismantling the network of [[beyliks]] loyal to the Ottoman Sultan. At the [[Battle of Ankara]], Timur's forces routed Bayezid I's forces, a shocking defeat for which no one was prepared. In the aftermath, the Ottoman Turks began fighting each other led by Bayezid's sons.{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=167}}\n\nThe Byzantines wasted no time exploiting the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}} By signing the treaty, they were able to recover Thessalonika and much of the Peloponnese. The [[Ottoman Interregnum|Ottoman civil war]] ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, with the support of the Byzantine Empire, defeated his opponents.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}}\n\n[[File:Tornese Andronicus II.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Along with the humiliation, the Byzantine tribute to the Ottomans of 300,000 silver coins would have been all the more difficult with the economy [[Byzantine economy#Constantinople.27s wealth|in decline.]]]]\nThe rare amity established between the two states would not last; the death of Mehmed I and the rise of [[Murad II]] in 1421 coupled with the ascent of [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]] to the Byzantine throne led to a deteriorated change in relations between the two. Neither leader was content with the status quo. John VIII made the first and foolish move by inciting a rebellion in the Ottoman Empire: a certain Mustafa had been released by the Byzantines and claimed that he was Bayezid's lost son.{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}}\n\nDespite the odds, a sizable force had mustered in Europe under his banner, defeating Murad II's subordinates. Murad II's furious reply eventually smashed this upstart and, in 1422, began the [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|Siege of Thessalonica]] and Constantinople.{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=167}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|pp=274&ndash;76}} John VIII then turned to his aging father, Manuel II, for advice. The result was that he incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks \u2014 this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, [[Kucuk Mustafa]]. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with Bursa coming under siege. After a [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|failed assault on Constantinople]], Murad II was forced to turn back his army and defeat Kucuk. With these defeats, the Byzantines were forced once more into vassalage \u2014 300,000 coins of silver were to be delivered to the Sultan as tribute on an annual basis.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=276}}\n\n==Ottoman victory 1424\u20131453==\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|250px|left|The Ottoman Empire in 1451. By this point all of Byzantium's major cities had fallen to the Ottomans who occupied almost half of Anatolia and most of the Balkans]]\nThe Ottomans faced numerous opponents between 1424 and 1453. Tied down by the [[Siege of Thessalonika (1422)|siege of Thessalonika]], the Ottomans had to contend with the Serbs under [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107|George Brankovic]], the Hungarians under [[John Hunyadi]] and the Albanians under [[Skanderbeg|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=184}}{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=279}} This resistance culminated into the [[Crusade of Varna]] of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception \u2013 a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians \u2013 was defeated.\n\nIn 1448 and 1451, there was a change in the Byzantine and Ottoman leaderships, respectively. Murad II died and was succeeded by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] whilst [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] succeeded John VIII. Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well; the former's successful conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter, who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region, and Mehmed had around 40,000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains. Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=280}} regarding the status quo. Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance. The Ottomans already controlled the land around Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453. Despite a union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the Byzantines received no official aid from the Pope or Western Europe, with the exception of a few soldiers from Venice and Genoa.\n\nEngland and France were in the concluding stages of the [[Hundred Years War]]. The French did not wish to lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was in the final stages of the [[Reconquista]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]], never centralized enough behind the [[Hohenstaufen]] to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the [[Hussite wars]] seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the [[Polish\u2013Teutonic Wars]] kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nOther than these major European powers, the only others were the [[Italian maritime republics|Italian city-states]]. Genoa and Venice were both enemies of the Ottomans, but also of each other. The Venetians considered sending their fleet up to attack the fortifications guarding the [[Dardanelles]] and the Bosporus, thereby relieving the city but the force was too small and arrived too late. The Ottomans would have overpowered any military assistance provided by one city, even one as large and powerful as the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. In any case some 2,000 mercenaries, mostly Italian under [[Giovanni Giustiniani Longo]],{{sfn|Sherrard|1967||p=168}} arrived to assist in the defence of the city. The city's entire defence fell to these mercenaries and 5,000 militia soldiers raised from a city whose population had been seriously eroded by heavy taxation, plague and civil conflict.{{sfn|Mango|2002}} Though poorly trained, the defenders were well armed with many weapons,{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=168}} except for any cannons to match the Ottoman's own artillery.\n\n[[File:Aya sofya.jpg|left|thumb|The city's largest church, the [[Hagia Sophia]] was converted into a mosque. Today it serves as a Museum of Constantinopolitan legacy]]\nThe city's fall was not a result of the Ottoman artillery nor their naval supremacy (many Italian ships were able to aid and then escape the city).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} [[Fall of Constantinople|The Fall]] came about due to the combined weight of overwhelming odds stacked against the city \u2014 outnumbered by more than 10 to 1, the defenders were overcome by sheer attrition as well as the skill of the Ottoman [[Janissaries]]. As the Ottomans continued their seemingly unsuccessful and costly assaults, many in their camp began to doubt the success of the siege; history had shown the city to be invincible to Ottoman siege.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In an effort to raise morale, the Sultan then made a speech{{sfn|Sherrard|1967|p=169}} reminding his troops of the vast wealth and pillaging of the city to come. An all-out assault captured the city on May 29, 1453. As the Ottomans fanned out to sack the city, their naval discipline began to collapse and many Genoans and Venetians escaped in vessels from the city, including [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]],{{sfn|Grant|2005|p=123}} a Venetian surgeon present at the siege who wrote:\n\n{{cquote|All through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city. The blood flowed in the city like rainwater after a sudden storm, and the corpses of Turks and Christians were thrown into the Dardanelles, where they floated out to sea like melons along a canal.|20|20|}}\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|right|Byzantium's last years saw the loss of recent territories]]\nAfter the siege, the Ottomans went on to take [[Despotate of Morea|Morea]] in 1460, and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] in 1461.{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=283}} With the fall of Trebizond came the end of the Roman Empire; the [[Palaeologan dynasty]] continued to be recognized as the rightful emperors of Constantinople by the crowned heads of Europe until the 16th century when the [[Reformation]], the Ottoman threat to Europe and decreased interest in crusading forced European powers to recognize the Ottoman Empire as masters of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]]. After the [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|Fall of Trebizond]] also the [[Principality of Theodoro|Theodoro]] in 1475 and with [[Vonitsa]] the [[Despotate of Epirus]] in 1479{{sfn|Fine|1987|p=563}} were conquered by the Ottomans.\n\n==Causes of the Byzantine defeat==\n\n===Latin intervention===\nThe Latin presence in the Balkans seriously undermined the Byzantines' ability to coordinate their efforts against the Ottoman Turks. This is exemplified by [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], whose attempts to drive the Latins out of Greece led to the abandonment of the Anatolian borders which allowed several beyliks, as well as the Turks of Osman I to raid and settle former Byzantine lands. Andronicus II's campaigns in Anatolia, though it obtained some military success, was constantly thwarted by events in the west of the Empire.{{sfn|Mango|2002}} In any event, the Byzantines were forced to choose between Papal and Latin threat of attack or an unpopular union, which was exploited by numerous rival claimants as cause for a [[coup]] against the Byzantine Emperor.\n\n[[File:Last Crusader.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Romantic portrayal of the \"Last Crusader\". Increasing Muslim victories, Christian defeats and European transgressions coupled with the Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to the end of the Crusades.]]\nNonetheless, towards the mid- and late-14th century, the Byzantines began to receive nominal aid from the West. This was little more than sympathy toward a fellow-Christian power fighting a Muslim power and despite two Crusades, the Byzantines \"received as much help from Rome as we did from the [Mamluk] sultan [of Egypt].\"{{sfn|Madden|2005}} The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in the 13th century had been one of the most determined powers to remove Christian influence in the Middle East and raiding by Cyprus did not change this in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n===Byzantine weakness===\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines were left in an unstable position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time \u2014 the weakening of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] resulted in many [[beyliks]] breaking away as autonomous states, such as the [[Ottoman Emirate|Emirate]] founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the [[Empire of Nicaea]] a temporary free hand, it was nothing more than a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.{{opinion|date=June 2019}}{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn order to implement these Greek re-conquests, Michael VIII was forced to levy crushing taxes on the Anatolian peasantry{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=179}} in order to pay for the expensive army that modeled around the [[Komnenian army]]. This led to much peasant support for the Turks whose system resulted in fewer taxes initially.\n\nAfter Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines suffered from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much later on in the 15th century; by that time, the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341\u201371) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Ottoman strengths===\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.Sipahis.jpg|left|thumb|The Ottomans combined several different fighting methods and technologies. These Sipahis were exactly unique for western knights due to their weapons and battlefield experiments.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}]]\nThe Ottomans had great diplomatic skill and ability to raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines,{{sfn|Turnbull|2003|p=12}} they were able to exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.\n\nIt was the Ottomans' skill with dealing with their opponents that made them very powerful very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them,{{sfn|Mango|2002|p=270}} otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states in the form of children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Consequences==\nThe [[fall of Constantinople]] came as a shock to the papacy, which ordered an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade. Only [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]] responded but under the condition that a powerful monarch assist him; however, none would do so.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=189}} [[Pope Pius II]] then ordered another crusade. Again, no substantial efforts were seen by any of Europe's major leaders of the time. This forced the Pope himself to lead a crusade. His death in 1464 led to the disbanding of the crusade at the port of [[Ancona]].{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=189}}\n\nThe Fall also had many implications in Europe: the influx of Greek science and culture into Europe by those escaping the Ottomans was a crucial factor in catalyzing the European [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe failed attempts at defeating the Ottomans at [[Crusade of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]] and [[Crusade of Varna|Varna]], the loss of the [[Holy Land]] (without Byzantium the Crusades could not re-supply en route) and the lack of a genuine counter-attack led many, including [[Martin Luther]], into believing that the Turks were God's punishment against the sins of Christians:\n<blockquote>''How shamefully...the pope has this long time baited us with the war against the Turks, taken our money, destroyed so many Christians and made so much mischief!\"{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=193}}</blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, by 1529, Europe began to rise to the threat of the Ottomans. Martin Luther, changing his views, wrote that the \"Scourge of God\"{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=193}} had to be fought with great vigour by secular leaders rather than as Crusades initiated by the Papacy.\n\nWith the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople ''[[de facto]]'' recognized by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans went on to facilitate further [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquests in Europe]] and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austrian]] attempts to contain the Ottoman threat became more and more a formality until the official dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] after [[World War I]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Byzantine Empire|War}}\n* [[Byzantine empire]]\n* [[Ottoman empire]]\n* [[Ottoman Navy]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n* [[Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars]]\n* [[List of conflicts in the Middle East]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Bartusis |first=Mark C. |title=The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204\u20131453 |year=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-1620-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Jerry H.|last2=Ziegler|first2=Herbert F.|title=Traditions & Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZlMwwEACAAJ|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-299835-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|title=The late medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the late twelfth century to the Ottoman Conquest|url=https://archive.org/details/latemedievalbalk00fine|url-access=registration|date=January 1987|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-10079-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Grant |first=R.G. |title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |ref=harv |isbn=0756613604 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/battlevisualjour0000gran_e3z7 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Laiou |first=Angeliki E. |title=Constantinople and the Latins: The Foreign Policy of Andronicus II, 1282\u20131328 |year=1972 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-16535-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Madden|first=Thomas F.|title=Crusades: The Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eudAAAACAAJ|date=12 September 2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-03127-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Mango |first=Cyril |title=The Oxford History of Byzantium |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford UP|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Nicol |first=Donald MacGillivray |title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261\u20131453 |year=1993 |authorlink=Donald Nicol |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43991-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Parker |first=Geoffrey |title=Compact history of the world |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=Times Books|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Johnathan |year=2004 |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/crusades/fourth-crusade-and-sack-constantinople|title=The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople &#124; History Today |website=www.historytoday.com |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sherrard|first=Philip|title=Byzantium: Great Ages of Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jo4ixwEACAAJ |year=1967|publisher=Time-Life International|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Treadgold |first=Warren T. |title=A History of the Byzantine State and Society |year=1997 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-2630-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Turnbull |first=Stephen  |title=The Ottoman Empire 1326\u20131699 |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Osprey|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Vryonis |first=Speros S. |title=The decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: And the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century |year=1971 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-01597-5|ref=harv}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Byzantine-Ottoman Wars}}\n[[Category:Byzantine\u2013Ottoman wars| ]]\n", "name_user": "Geralt Riv", "label": "safe", "comment": "svg file", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Ottoman_wars"}

Bremmer]], [[Julius Meier-Graefe]] and {{ill|Hans Rosenhagen|de}} that the paintings he was selling were genuine and they supplied certificates of authenticity without proof of [[provenance]]. These experts accepted his account that a Russian had bought the paintings, transferred them to Switzerland illegally, and had commissioned an illegal agent to sell them. They understood the need for this Russian to remain anonymous in order to prevent reprisals from relatives who still lived in the [[Soviet Union]].  Thannhauser, Matthiesen and Goldschmidt galleries bought some of the paintings.\n\nWacker's paintings were to be exhibited in January 1928 by the firm of [[Paul Cassirer]] in Berlin. It was organized to coincide with the publication of de la Faille's standard catalogue of Van Gogh's work. When Wacker delivered the last four paintings, {{ill|Grete Ring|de}} and {{ill|Walter Feilchenfeldt|de}}, the general managers of the exhibition, noticed the differences and recognized them as fakes. The canvases were returned to Wacker.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=M.

Galleries that had sold his paintings asked their customers to return them. Hugo Perls, an art dealer and lawyer who had bought several paintings, still insisted that they were authentic.<ref>For [[Hugo Perls]]' view of the Wacker affair see: Hugo Perls, ''Warum ist Camilla sch\u00f6n?'' Von Kunst, K\u00fcnstlern und Kunsthandel, M\u00fcnchen 1962. pp. ???.</ref> In December 1928 the Matthiesen gallery, with the aid of the Federation of German Art and Antique Dealers, sued Wacker.\n\nDe la Faille responded to the accusations by publishing a supplement to his catalogue in November 1928, which listed all the paintings supplied by Wacker as fakes.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/> In 1930 de la Faille published ''Les faux van Goghs'' (''The False Van Goghs'') which again listed the suspect paintings among 174 that he regarded as forgeries.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/> In May 1929 the studios of Wacker's father and brother were raided by police, who seized nine paintings from Hans and twelve from Leonhard. The latter claimed that the paintings were only in his studio for restoration.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/> The [[National Gallery (Berlin)|National Gallery]] in Berlin analysed the paints used in the seized artworks; they discovered the presence of a resin used to accelerate the drying process, which had not been found in any genuine van Goghs.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/>\n\nThe trial against Wacker began on 6 April 1932. Vincent Willem van Gogh, nephew of the painter, gave the first evidence at the trial and stated that family records did not include any Russian who would have purchased any paintings. De la Faille, on the other hand, had changed his mind once again and claimed that five of the paintings were genuine. During the trial, various experts did not come to full agreement on what paintings were authentic (and the argument was to continue in some circles for years afterwards). Bremmer argued that at least 9 paintings were genuine. Meier-Grafe admitted his mistake and even that the expert opinion could be fallible. Hans Rosenhagen said that 14 of the works were inferior but genuine. However, the Dutch restorer A M de Wild found that the pigments used in the paintings were not similar to those Van Gogh had used. Art restorer Kurt Wehlte showed with X-rays that the painting techniques were different (although he used a painting that was declared a forgery in the 1970s). Later it was found that the paintings had not been painted on French canvases at all. On 19 April 1932 Wacker was charged with fraud, and after an appeal, was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a fine of 30,000 [[reichsmark]]s. Some former directors of the [[Bank f\u00fcr Deutsche Beamte]], who had been speculating on the paintings on behalf of the bank, were sued. A few of the incriminated paintings have disappeared since the close of the affair.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Modris Eksteins]], ''Solar Dance.

It claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire, along with the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], its rulers briefly proclaiming themselves as Emperors in 1225/1227\u20131242 (during which it is most often called the [[Empire of Thessalonica]]). The term \"Despotate of Epirus\" is, like \"Byzantine Empire\" itself, a modern [[historiographic]] convention and not a name in use at the time.\n\nThe Despotate was centred on the region of [[Epirus]], encompassing also [[Albania]] and the western portion of [[Greek Macedonia]] and also included [[Thessaly]] and western Greece as far south as [[Nafpaktos]]. Through a policy of aggressive expansion under [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] the Despotate of Epirus also briefly came to incorporate central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], with the establishment of the [[Empire of Thessalonica]] in 1224, and [[Thrace]] as far east as [[Didymoteicho]] and [[Adrianopolis]], and was on the verge of recapturing Constantinople and restoring the Byzantine Empire before the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] in 1230 where he was defeated by the [[Bulgarian Empire]]. After that, the Epirote state contracted to its core in Epirus and Thessaly, and was forced into vassalage to other regional powers. It nevertheless managed to retain its autonomy until conquered by the restored [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] [[Byzantine Empire]] in ca. 1337. In the 1410s, the [[Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]] [[Carlo I Tocco]] managed to reunite the core of the Epirote state, but his successors gradually lost it to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire]], with the last stronghold, [[Vonitsa]], falling to the Ottomans in 1479.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\nIn traditional and modern [[historiography]], the Epirote state is usually termed the \"Despotate of Epirus\" and its rulers are summarily attributed the title of \"[[Despot (court title)|Despot]]\" from its inception, but this use is not strictly accurate.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=68}} First of all, the title of \"Despot\" was not borne by all Epirote rulers: the state's founder, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]], never used it, and is only anachronistically referred to as \"Despot of Epirus\" in 14th-century Western European sources. His successor [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] did not use it either, and actually crowned himself emperor (''[[basileus]]'') at [[Thessalonica]] {{circa|1225}}. The first ruler of Epirus to receive the title of Despot was [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]], from his uncle [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas|Manuel of Thessalonica]] in the 1230s, and then again, as a sign of submission and vassalage, from the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean emperor]] [[John III Vatatzes]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=68\u201369}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=716}} Earlier historians assumed that Michael I was indeed named \"Despot\" by the deposed emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] after ransoming him from [[Latinokratia|Latin]] captivity in {{circa|1206/7}} or {{circa|1210}}; this has been disproven by more recent research.{{sfn|Nicol|1984|p=2}}\n\nFurthermore, even after Michael II, speaking of the Epirote rulers as \"Despots ''of'' Epirus\" is technically incorrect.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=69}} The title of Despot did not imply any specific territorial jurisdiction, nor was it hereditary; it was merely the highest rank in the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine court hierarchy]], awarded by a reigning emperor to close relatives, usually his sons. Consequently, it was often borne by the princes sent to govern semi-autonomous [[appanage]]s and came to be associated later with these territories (aside from Epirus, the [[Despotate of the Morea]] is the most notable case). The territorial term \"despotate\" itself (in Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u1fb6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, ''despotaton'') was not used in contemporary sources for Epirus until the 14th century, e.g. in the ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'', in the history of [[John Kantakouzenos]], the hagiography of St. Niphon, or the ''[[Chronicle of the Tocco]]'', where the inhabitants of the Despotate are referred to as the ''Despotatoi''.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=38\u201339}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=614, 716}}{{sfn|Stiernon|1959|pp=122\u2013126}} The term \"Despotate of Epirus\" is thus sometimes replaced by \"(Independent) State of Epirus\" in more recent historiography.{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Epirote realm itself did not have an official name. Contemporaries, particularly in Western Europe, used the term ''Rh\u014dmania'' (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1), which generally referred to the whole Byzantine Empire, to refer specifically to Epirus, as seen in the [[Latin]] title of ''Despotus Romanie'' claimed by [[Philip I of Taranto]] and his son [[Philip, Despot of Romania|Philip of Apulia]], [[Nicholas Orsini]], and later [[Carlo I Tocco]].{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=38}} In the Byzantine world, the term ''Dysis'' (\u0394\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"West\", which historically referred to [[Dalmatia]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Sicily]], or even the entire European part of the Empire, also came into use already in the 13th century when juxtaposing Epirus to its eastern rival, the [[Empire of Nicaea]], which was then called ''Anatol\u0113'' (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), \"East\".{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=39\u201340}} Moreover, the term \"Hellenes\" was widely used instead of the earlier \"Romans\" by the 13th century court of the Despotate to describe its population.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bialor |first1=Perry |title=Chapter 2, Greek Ethnic Survival Under Ottoman Domination |journal=ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst |date=2008 |page=73 |url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/anthro_res_rpt9/1/ |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:Epirus 1205-1230-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1205 to 1230]]\n\nThe Epirote state was founded in 1205 by [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], a cousin of the [[Byzantine emperor]]s [[Isaac II Angelos]] and [[Alexios III Angelos]]. At first, Michael allied with [[Boniface of Montferrat]], but having lost the [[Morea]] ([[Peloponnese]]) to the [[Franks]] at the [[battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]], he went to [[Epirus]], where he considered himself the Byzantine governor of the old province of [[Nicopolis]] and revolted against Boniface. Epirus soon became the new home of many refugees from [[Constantinople]], [[Thessaly]], and the [[Peloponnese]], and Michael was described as a second [[Noah]], rescuing men from the [[Latin Empire|Latin]] flood. [[John X Kamateros]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], did not consider him a legitimate successor and instead joined [[Theodore I Laskaris]] in [[\u0130znik|Nicaea]]; Michael instead recognized the authority of [[Pope Innocent III]] over Epirus, cutting ties to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[Henry of Flanders]] demanded that Michael submit to the [[Latin Empire]], which he did, at least nominally, by allowing his daughter to marry Henry's brother Eustace in 1209. Michael did not honour this alliance, assuming that mountainous Epirus would be mostly impenetrable by any Latins with whom he made and broke alliances. Meanwhile, Boniface's relatives from [[Montferrat]] made claims to [[Epirus]] as well, and in 1210 Michael allied with the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and attacked Boniface's [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. Michael was excessively cruel to his prisoners, in some cases [[crucifixion|crucifying]] Latin priests. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Pope Innocent III excommunicated him in response. Henry forced Michael into a renewed nominal alliance later that year.\n\nMichael turned his attention to capturing other strategically important Latin-held towns, including [[Larissa]] and [[Epidamnos|Dyrrhachium]]. He also took control of the ports on the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. In 1214 he captured [[Corfu|Corcyra]] from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he was [[assassination|assassinated]] later that year and was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore.\n\n==Conflict with Nicaea and Bulgaria==\n[[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] immediately set out to attack [[Thessalonica]], and he fought with the [[Bulgaria]]ns along the way. Henry of Flanders died on the way to counterattack, and in 1217 Theodore captured his successor [[Peter II of Courtenay|Peter of Courtenay]], most likely executing him. The Latin Empire, however, became [[battle of Poimanenos|distracted]] by the growing power of Nicaea and could not stop Theodore from capturing Thessalonica in 1224. Theodore now challenged Nicaea for the imperial title and crowned himself emperor, founding the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. In 1225, after [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] of Nicaea had taken [[Adrianople]], Theodore arrived and took it back from him. Theodore also allied with the [[Bulgarians]] and drove the Latins out of [[Thrace]]. In 1227 Theodore crowned himself Byzantine emperor, although this was not recognized by most Greeks, especially not the Patriarch in Nicaea.\n\nIn 1230 Theodore broke the truce with [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], hoping to remove [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]], who had held him back from attacking Constantinople. In the [[battle of Klokotnitsa]] (near [[Haskovo]] in [[Bulgaria]]) the Bulgarian emperor defeated Theodore, capturing and later blinding him.  His brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas]] took power in Thessalonica, but Epirus itself soon broke away under Michael I's bastard son, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]]. Manuel awarded Michael the title of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]\u2014making Michael the first Epirote ruler to bear the title\u2014as a sign of his nominal dependency on Thessalonica, but Michael was ''de facto'' independent, which he demonstrated by seizing Corfu in ca. 1236. In the rump Empire of Thessalonica, after Theodore was released in 1237, he overthrew his brother Manuel, and set up his son [[John Komnenos Doukas]] as ruler of Thessalonica.\n\n==Nicaean and Byzantine suzerainty==\n{{see also|Epirote\u2013Nicaean conflict (1257\u201359)}}\n[[Image:Epiro1230-1251.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1230 to 1251]]\n[[Image:Epir1252-1315.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1252 to 1315]]\n\nThessalonica never regained its power after the battle of Klokotnitsa. Theodore's younger son [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas]] lost Thessalonica to Nicaea in 1246 and Michael II of Epirus allied with the Latins against the Nicaeans. In 1248 [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] of Nicaea forced Michael to recognize him as emperor, and officially recognized him in turn as ''despot\u0113s'' in Epirus. Vatatzes' granddaughter Maria later (in 1256) married Michael's son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]], although she died in 1258. Also in 1248 Michael's daughter Anna married [[William II Villehardouin|William II]], [[Principality of Achaea|Prince of Achaea]], and Michael decided to honour this alliance over his obligations to Vatatzes. The allies were defeated in the ensuing conflict at the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] in 1259.\n\nEmperor [[Theodore II Laskaris]] allied with Michael II, and their children, betrothed by John years before, finally married in 1256, with Theodore receiving Dyrrhachium in return. Michael did not accept this transfer of land, and in 1257 he revolted, defeating a Nicaean army led by [[George Acropolites]]. As Michael marched on Thessalonica, he was attacked by King [[Manfred of Sicily]], who conquered [[Albania]] and [[Corcyra]]. However, Michael immediately allied with him by marrying his daughter Helena to him. After Theodore II died, Michael, Manuel, and William II fought the new Nicaean emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. The alliance was very unstable and in 1259 William was captured at the disastrous [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. Michael VIII went on to capture Michael II's capital of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], leaving Epirus with only [[Ioannina]] and Vonitsa. Arta was recovered by 1260 while Michael VIII was occupied against Constantinople.\n\n==Italian invasions==\nAfter Michael VIII restored the empire in Constantinople in 1261 he frequently harassed Epirus, and forced Michael's son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]] to marry his niece [[Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene]] in 1265. Michael considered Epirus a [[vassal]] state, although Michael II and Nikephoros continued to ally with the Princes of Achaea and the [[Duchy of Athens|Dukes of Athens]]. In 1267 Corcyra and much of Epirus were taken by [[Charles of Anjou]], and in 1267/68 Michael II died.  Michael VIII did not attempt to annex Epirus directly, and allowed Nikephoros I to succeed his father and deal with Charles, who captured Dyrrhachium in 1271. In 1279 Nikephoros allied with Charles against Michael VIII, agreeing to become Charles' vassal. With Charles' defeat soon after Nikephoros lost Albania to the Byzantines.\n\nUnder [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], son of Michael VIII, Nikephoros renewed the alliance with Constantinople. Nikephoros, however, was persuaded to ally with [[Charles II of Naples]] in 1292, although Charles was defeated by Andronikos's fleet. Nikephoros married his daughter to Charles's son [[Philip I of Taranto]] and sold much of his territory to him. After Nikephoros's death in c. 1297 Byzantine influence grew under his widow Anna, Andronikos's cousin, who ruled as regent for her young son [[Thomas I Komnenos Doukas]]. In 1306 she revolted against Philip in favour of Andronikos; the Latin inhabitants were expelled but she was forced to return some territory to Philip. In 1312 Philip abandoned his claim to Epirus and claimed the defunct Latin Empire of Constantinople instead as the inheritance of his wife [[Catherine II of Valois, Princess of Achaea]].\n\n==Collapse of the despotate==\n[[Image:Epir1315-1358.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1315 to 1358]]\n\nAnna succeeded in marrying off Thomas to a daughter of Michael IX, but Thomas was assassinated in 1318 by his cousin [[Nicholas Orsini]], who married his widow and claimed to rule not only Epirus, but all of Greece; his rule was limited only to Akamania, or the southern part of Epirus. He was overthrown by his brother [[John II Orsini|John]] in 1323, who attempted to balance submission to Constantinople with cooperation with the Angevins of Naples, who also claimed Greece as part of their domains. John was poisoned around 1335 by his wife Anna, who became regent for their son [[Nikephoros II Orsini|Nikephoros II]]. In 1337 the new Emperor, [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]], arrived in northern Epirus with an army partly composed of 2,000 Turks contributed by his ally [[Umur the Lion|Umur of Ayd\u0131n]]. Andronikos first dealt with unrest due to attacks by Albanians and then turned his interest to the Despotate. Anna tried to negotiate and obtain the Despotate for her son when he came of age, but Andronikos demanded the complete surrender of the Despotate to which she finally agreed. Thus Epirus came peacefully under imperial rule, with [[Theodore Synadenos]] as governor.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=179-181}}\n\nThe imperials had insisted that Nikephoros would be engaged to one of the daughters of the emperor's right-hand man, [[John VI Kantakouzenos|John Kantakouzenos]]. When the time of the engagement came, Nikephoros had vanished. Andronikos learned that Nikephoros had fled to Italy, with the help of members of the Epirote aristocracy who supported an independent Epirus. He stayed in [[Taranto]], Italy, in the court of Catherine II of Valois (Philip of Taranto's widow), the [[Titular ruler|titular]] empress of Constantinople.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=181}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Church of the Parigoritissa|Paregoretissa Church]], the new cathedral of the Despotate's capital, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], built in the 13th century during the reign of [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]].]]\n\nIn 1339 a revolt began, supported by Catherine of Valois, who had previously moved to the Peloponnese, and by Nikephoros who had returned to Epirus, based in Thomokastron. By the end of the year the imperial army returned to the area, and in the following year, 1340, Andronikos III himself arrived together with John Kantakouzenos. Nikephoros was persuaded through diplomacy to recognize the authority of the emperor. He surrendered Thomokastron, married Maria Kantakouzene, the daughter of John Kantakouzenos, and received the title of ''[[panhypersebastos]]''.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=181}}\n\nThe Empire soon fell into a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|civil war]] between [[John V Palaiologos]] and John VI Kantakouzenos, and Epirus was conquered by the [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] tsar [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] in 1348, who appointed his brother, despot [[Simeon Uro\u0161|Simeon Nemanji\u0107-Palailogos]] as governor of the province.{{sfn|Soulis|1984|p=}} Nikephoros II took advantage of the Byzantine civil war and the death of Du\u0161an (1355) to escape and to reestablish himself in Epirus in 1356, to which he also added Thessaly. Nikephoros [[Battle of Achelous (1359)|was killed in battle]] putting down an [[Albanians|Albanian]] revolt in 1359, and the territory of the former despotate became a component part of the personal Empire of Du\u0161an's brother [[Simeon Uro\u0161|Simeon Nemanji\u0107-Palailogos]]. Simeon was also governing Thessaly at the time, and, as the ''Chronicle of Ioannina'' shows, he left much of the territory under the control of Albanian clans establishing short-lived entities: the clan of [[Peter Losha|Peter Liosha]] held [[Despotate of Arta|Arta]], and the clan of [[Muriq Shpata]] held Aetoloacarnania, with [[Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto|Angelokastron]] as its capital.\n\nIn 1367 a part of the Epirotan Despotate was resurrected under local Serbian nobleman [[Thomas II Preljubovi\u0107]], who kept Ioannina. After Thomas' death in 1384, his widow remarried in 1385 and transferred the Despotate to homage of Italian nobility. The state tradition was carried on by the Serbian and Italian rulers of [[Ioannina]], who solicited aid from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] against the Albanians. In 1399 the Albanian leader of [[Principality of Gjirokast\u00ebr]], [[Gjon Zenebishi]] captured the Despot [[Esau de' Buondelmonti]] and released him after 15 months, when his relatives in Italy offered a huge amount of money as a ransom. By 1416 the [[Tocco family]] of [[Cephalonia]] succeeded in reuniting Epirus, or at least in asserting their control over its towns. But internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which proceeded with the capture of Ioannina in 1430, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] in 1449, [[Angelokastro (Aetolia-Acarnania)|Angelokastron]] in 1460, and finally [[Vonitsa]] in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was the end of Frankish rule in mainland [[Greece]].\n\n==Rulers==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=120\n | header            = Coats of arms of Epirote dynasties\n | image1            = Blason Orsini-Epirus.png\n | caption1          = [[Orsini dynasty]]\n | image2            = Coat of arms of the Nemanic Dynasty.svg\n | caption2          = [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]]\n | image3            = Buondelmonti.PNG\n | caption3          = [[Buondelmonti dynasty]]\n | image4            = Tocco stemma.png\n | caption4          = [[Tocco dynasty]]\n}}\n\n===Komnenos Doukas dynasty===\n*[[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] (1205\u20131214)\n*[[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] (1214\u20131230), emperor in Thessalonica from 1225 or 1227\n*[[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]] (1230\u20131271)\n*[[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] (1271\u20131297)\n*[[Thomas I Komnenos Doukas]] (1297\u20131318)\n\n===Orsini dynasty===\n*[[Nicholas Orsini]] (1318\u20131323)\n*[[John II Orsini|John Orsini]] (1323\u20131335)\n*[[Nikephoros II Orsini]] (1335\u20131337 and 1356\u20131359)\n\n===Nemanji\u0107 dynasty===\n{{Main|Nemanji\u0107 dynasty}}\n* [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], emperor ([[tsar]]) of Serbs and Greeks, conquered Epirus in 1347 and appointed his brother as governor \n* [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], governor of Epirus since 1347, and self-proclaimed emperor ([[tsar]]) of Serbs and Greeks since 1356\n* [[Thomas II Preljubovi\u0107]] (1367\u20131384), despot and lord of Epirus, son-in-law of tsar Simeon Uro\u0161\n* [[Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina]] (1384\u20131385), basilissa\n\n===Buondelmonti dynasty===\n*[[Esau de' Buondelmonti]] (1385\u20131411)\n*[[Giorgio de' Buondelmonti]] (1411)\n\n===Tocco dynasty===\n*[[Carlo I Tocco]] (1411\u20131429)\n*[[Carlo II Tocco]] (1429\u20131448), fall of Ioannina 1430\n*[[Leonardo III Tocco]] (1448\u20131479), fall of Arta 1449 and Angelokastron 1460\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp Jr.|authorlink=John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|origyear=1987|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=University of Michigan Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | encyclopedia = [[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford and New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | editor1-last = Arbel | editor1-first = Benjamin | editor2-last = Hamilton | editor2-first = Bernhard | editor3-last = Jacoby | editor3-first = David | title = Latins and Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204 | year = 1989 | publisher = Frank Cass & Co.

It claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire, along with the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], its rulers briefly proclaiming themselves as Emperors in 1225/1227\u20131242 (during which it is most often called the [[Empire of Thessalonica]]). The term \"Despotate of Epirus\" is, like \"Byzantine Empire\" itself, a modern [[historiographic]] convention and not a name in use at the time.\n\nThe Despotate was centred on the region of [[Epirus]], encompassing also [[Albania]] and the western portion of [[Greek Macedonia]] and also included [[Thessaly]] and western Greece as far south as [[Nafpaktos]]. Through a policy of aggressive expansion under [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] the Despotate of Epirus also briefly came to incorporate central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], with the establishment of the [[Empire of Thessalonica]] in 1224, and [[Thrace]] as far east as [[Didymoteicho]] and [[Adrianopolis]], and was on the verge of recapturing Constantinople and restoring the Byzantine Empire before the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]] in 1230 where he was defeated by the [[Bulgarian Empire]]. After that, the Epirote state contracted to its core in Epirus and Thessaly, and was forced into vassalage to other regional powers. It nevertheless managed to retain its autonomy until conquered by the restored [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] [[Byzantine Empire]] in ca. 1337. In the 1410s, the [[Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]] [[Carlo I Tocco]] managed to reunite the core of the Epirote state, but his successors gradually lost it to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire]], with the last stronghold, [[Vonitsa]], falling to the Ottomans in 1479.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\nIn traditional and modern [[historiography]], the Epirote state is usually termed the \"Despotate of Epirus\" and its rulers are summarily attributed the title of \"[[Despot (court title)|Despot]]\" from its inception, but this use is not strictly accurate.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=68}} First of all, the title of \"Despot\" was not borne by all Epirote rulers: the state's founder, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]], never used it, and is only anachronistically referred to as \"Despot of Epirus\" in 14th-century Western European sources. His successor [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] did not use it either, and actually crowned himself emperor (''[[basileus]]'') at [[Thessalonica]] {{circa|1225}}. The first ruler of Epirus to receive the title of Despot was [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]], from his uncle [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas|Manuel of Thessalonica]] in the 1230s, and then again, as a sign of submission and vassalage, from the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean emperor]] [[John III Vatatzes]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=68\u201369}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=716}} Earlier historians assumed that Michael I was indeed named \"Despot\" by the deposed emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] after ransoming him from [[Latinokratia|Latin]] captivity in {{circa|1206/7}} or {{circa|1210}}; this has been disproven by more recent research.{{sfn|Nicol|1984|p=2}}\n\nFurthermore, even after Michael II, speaking of the Epirote rulers as \"Despots ''of'' Epirus\" is technically incorrect.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=69}} The title of Despot did not imply any specific territorial jurisdiction, nor was it hereditary; it was merely the highest rank in the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine court hierarchy]], awarded by a reigning emperor to close relatives, usually his sons. Consequently, it was often borne by the princes sent to govern semi-autonomous [[appanage]]s and came to be associated later with these territories (aside from Epirus, the [[Despotate of the Morea]] is the most notable case). The territorial term \"despotate\" itself (in Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u1fb6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, ''despotaton'') was not used in contemporary sources for Epirus until the 14th century, e.g. in the ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'', in the history of [[John Kantakouzenos]], the hagiography of St. Niphon, or the ''[[Chronicle of the Tocco]]'', where the inhabitants of the Despotate are referred to as the ''Despotatoi''.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=38\u201339}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=614, 716}}{{sfn|Stiernon|1959|pp=122\u2013126}} The term \"Despotate of Epirus\" is thus sometimes replaced by \"(Independent) State of Epirus\" in more recent historiography.{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Epirote realm itself did not have an official name. Contemporaries, particularly in Western Europe, used the term ''Rh\u014dmania'' (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1), which generally referred to the whole Byzantine Empire, to refer specifically to Epirus, as seen in the [[Latin]] title of ''Despotus Romanie'' claimed by [[Philip I of Taranto]] and his son [[Philip, Despot of Romania|Philip of Apulia]], [[Nicholas Orsini]], and later [[Carlo I Tocco]].{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=38}} In the Byzantine world, the term ''Dysis'' (\u0394\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"West\", which historically referred to [[Dalmatia]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Sicily]], or even the entire European part of the Empire, also came into use already in the 13th century when juxtaposing Epirus to its eastern rival, the [[Empire of Nicaea]], which was then called ''Anatol\u0113'' (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), \"East\".{{sfn|Veikou|2012|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=39\u201340}} Moreover, the term \"Hellenes\" was widely used instead of the earlier \"Romans\" by the 13th century court of the Despotate to describe its population.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bialor |first1=Perry |title=Chapter 2, Greek Ethnic Survival Under Ottoman Domination |journal=ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst |date=2008 |page=73 |url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/anthro_res_rpt9/1/ |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:Epirus 1205-1230-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1205 to 1230]]\n\nThe Epirote state was founded in 1205 by [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], a cousin of the [[Byzantine emperor]]s [[Isaac II Angelos]] and [[Alexios III Angelos]]. At first, Michael allied with [[Boniface of Montferrat]], but having lost the [[Morea]] ([[Peloponnese]]) to the [[Franks]] at the [[battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]], he went to [[Epirus]], where he considered himself the Byzantine governor of the old province of [[Nicopolis]] and revolted against Boniface. Epirus soon became the new home of many refugees from [[Constantinople]], [[Thessaly]], and the [[Peloponnese]], and Michael was described as a second [[Noah]], rescuing men from the [[Latin Empire|Latin]] flood. [[John X Kamateros]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], did not consider him a legitimate successor and instead joined [[Theodore I Laskaris]] in [[\u0130znik|Nicaea]]; Michael instead recognized the authority of [[Pope Innocent III]] over Epirus, cutting ties to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n[[Henry of Flanders]] demanded that Michael submit to the [[Latin Empire]], which he did, at least nominally, by allowing his daughter to marry Henry's brother Eustace in 1209. Michael did not honour this alliance, assuming that mountainous Epirus would be mostly impenetrable by any Latins with whom he made and broke alliances. Meanwhile, Boniface's relatives from [[Montferrat]] made claims to [[Epirus]] as well, and in 1210 Michael allied with the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and attacked Boniface's [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. Michael was excessively cruel to his prisoners, in some cases [[crucifixion|crucifying]] Latin priests. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Pope Innocent III excommunicated him in response. Henry forced Michael into a renewed nominal alliance later that year.\n\nMichael turned his attention to capturing other strategically important Latin-held towns, including [[Larissa]] and [[Epidamnos|Dyrrhachium]]. He also took control of the ports on the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. In 1214 he captured [[Corfu|Corcyra]] from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he was [[assassination|assassinated]] later that year and was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore.\n\n==Conflict with Nicaea and Bulgaria==\n[[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] immediately set out to attack [[Thessalonica]], and he fought with the [[Bulgaria]]ns along the way. Henry of Flanders died on the way to counterattack, and in 1217 Theodore captured his successor [[Peter II of Courtenay|Peter of Courtenay]], most likely executing him. The Latin Empire, however, became [[battle of Poimanenos|distracted]] by the growing power of Nicaea and could not stop Theodore from capturing Thessalonica in 1224. Theodore now challenged Nicaea for the imperial title and crowned himself emperor, founding the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. In 1225, after [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] of Nicaea had taken [[Adrianople]], Theodore arrived and took it back from him. Theodore also allied with the [[Bulgarians]] and drove the Latins out of [[Thrace]]. In 1227 Theodore crowned himself Byzantine emperor, although this was not recognized by most Greeks, especially not the Patriarch in Nicaea.\n\nIn 1230 Theodore broke the truce with [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], hoping to remove [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]], who had held him back from attacking Constantinople. In the [[battle of Klokotnitsa]] (near [[Haskovo]] in [[Bulgaria]]) the Bulgarian emperor defeated Theodore, capturing and later blinding him.  His brother [[Manuel Komnenos Doukas]] took power in Thessalonica, but Epirus itself soon broke away under Michael I's bastard son, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]]. Manuel awarded Michael the title of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]\u2014making Michael the first Epirote ruler to bear the title\u2014as a sign of his nominal dependency on Thessalonica, but Michael was ''de facto'' independent, which he demonstrated by seizing Corfu in ca. 1236. In the rump Empire of Thessalonica, after Theodore was released in 1237, he overthrew his brother Manuel, and set up his son [[John Komnenos Doukas]] as ruler of Thessalonica.\n\n==Nicaean and Byzantine suzerainty==\n{{see also|Epirote\u2013Nicaean conflict (1257\u201359)}}\n[[Image:Epiro1230-1251.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1230 to 1251]]\n[[Image:Epir1252-1315.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1252 to 1315]]\n\nThessalonica never regained its power after the battle of Klokotnitsa. Theodore's younger son [[Demetrios Angelos Doukas]] lost Thessalonica to Nicaea in 1246 and Michael II of Epirus allied with the Latins against the Nicaeans. In 1248 [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] of Nicaea forced Michael to recognize him as emperor, and officially recognized him in turn as ''despot\u0113s'' in Epirus. Vatatzes' granddaughter Maria later (in 1256) married Michael's son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]], although she died in 1258. Also in 1248 Michael's daughter Anna married [[William II Villehardouin|William II]], [[Principality of Achaea|Prince of Achaea]], and Michael decided to honour this alliance over his obligations to Vatatzes. The allies were defeated in the ensuing conflict at the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] in 1259.\n\nEmperor [[Theodore II Laskaris]] allied with Michael II, and their children, betrothed by John years before, finally married in 1256, with Theodore receiving Dyrrhachium in return. Michael did not accept this transfer of land, and in 1257 he revolted, defeating a Nicaean army led by [[George Acropolites]]. As Michael marched on Thessalonica, he was attacked by King [[Manfred of Sicily]], who conquered [[Albania]] and [[Corcyra]]. However, Michael immediately allied with him by marrying his daughter Helena to him. After Theodore II died, Michael, Manuel, and William II fought the new Nicaean emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. The alliance was very unstable and in 1259 William was captured at the disastrous [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. Michael VIII went on to capture Michael II's capital of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], leaving Epirus with only [[Ioannina]] and Vonitsa. Arta was recovered by 1260 while Michael VIII was occupied against Constantinople.\n\n==Italian invasions==\nAfter Michael VIII restored the empire in Constantinople in 1261 he frequently harassed Epirus, and forced Michael's son [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros]] to marry his niece [[Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene]] in 1265. Michael considered Epirus a [[vassal]] state, although Michael II and Nikephoros continued to ally with the Princes of Achaea and the [[Duchy of Athens|Dukes of Athens]]. In 1267 Corcyra and much of Epirus were taken by [[Charles of Anjou]], and in 1267/68 Michael II died.  Michael VIII did not attempt to annex Epirus directly, and allowed Nikephoros I to succeed his father and deal with Charles, who captured Dyrrhachium in 1271. In 1279 Nikephoros allied with Charles against Michael VIII, agreeing to become Charles' vassal. With Charles' defeat soon after Nikephoros lost Albania to the Byzantines.\n\nUnder [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], son of Michael VIII, Nikephoros renewed the alliance with Constantinople. Nikephoros, however, was persuaded to ally with [[Charles II of Naples]] in 1292, although Charles was defeated by Andronikos's fleet. Nikephoros married his daughter to Charles's son [[Philip I of Taranto]] and sold much of his territory to him. After Nikephoros's death in c. 1297 Byzantine influence grew under his widow Anna, Andronikos's cousin, who ruled as regent for her young son [[Thomas I Komnenos Doukas]]. In 1306 she revolted against Philip in favour of Andronikos; the Latin inhabitants were expelled but she was forced to return some territory to Philip. In 1312 Philip abandoned his claim to Epirus and claimed the defunct Latin Empire of Constantinople instead as the inheritance of his wife [[Catherine II of Valois, Princess of Achaea]].\n\n==Collapse of the despotate==\n[[Image:Epir1315-1358.png|thumb|right|250px|The despotate of Epirus from 1315 to 1358]]\n\nAnna succeeded in marrying off Thomas to a daughter of Michael IX, but Thomas was assassinated in 1318 by his cousin [[Nicholas Orsini]], who married his widow and claimed to rule not only Epirus, but all of Greece; his rule was limited only to Akamania, or the southern part of Epirus. He was overthrown by his brother [[John II Orsini|John]] in 1323, who attempted to balance submission to Constantinople with cooperation with the Angevins of Naples, who also claimed Greece as part of their domains. John was poisoned around 1335 by his wife Anna, who became regent for their son [[Nikephoros II Orsini|Nikephoros II]]. In 1337 the new Emperor, [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]], arrived in northern Epirus with an army partly composed of 2,000 Turks contributed by his ally [[Umur the Lion|Umur of Ayd\u0131n]]. Andronikos first dealt with unrest due to attacks by Albanians and then turned his interest to the Despotate. Anna tried to negotiate and obtain the Despotate for her son when he came of age, but Andronikos demanded the complete surrender of the Despotate to which she finally agreed. Thus Epirus came peacefully under imperial rule, with [[Theodore Synadenos]] as governor.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=179-181}}\n\nThe imperials had insisted that Nikephoros would be engaged to one of the daughters of the emperor's right-hand man, [[John VI Kantakouzenos|John Kantakouzenos]]. When the time of the engagement came, Nikephoros had vanished. Andronikos learned that Nikephoros had fled to Italy, with the help of members of the Epirote aristocracy who supported an independent Epirus. He stayed in [[Taranto]], Italy, in the court of Catherine II of Valois (Philip of Taranto's widow), the [[Titular ruler|titular]] empress of Constantinople.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=181}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Church of the Parigoritissa|Paregoretissa Church]], the new cathedral of the Despotate's capital, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], built in the 13th century during the reign of [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]].]]\n\nIn 1339 a revolt began, supported by Catherine of Valois, who had previously moved to the Peloponnese, and by Nikephoros who had returned to Epirus, based in Thomokastron. By the end of the year the imperial army returned to the area, and in the following year, 1340, Andronikos III himself arrived together with John Kantakouzenos. Nikephoros was persuaded through diplomacy to recognize the authority of the emperor. He surrendered Thomokastron, married Maria Kantakouzene, the daughter of John Kantakouzenos, and received the title of ''[[panhypersebastos]]''.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=181}}\n\nThe Empire soon fell into a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347|civil war]] between [[John V Palaiologos]] and John VI Kantakouzenos, and Epirus was conquered by the [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] tsar [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] in 1348, who appointed his brother, despot [[Simeon Uro\u0161|Simeon Nemanji\u0107-Palailogos]] as governor of the province.{{sfn|Soulis|1984|p=}} Nikephoros II took advantage of the Byzantine civil war and the death of Du\u0161an (1355) to escape and to reestablish himself in Epirus in 1356, to which he also added Thessaly. Nikephoros [[Battle of Achelous (1359)|was killed in battle]] putting down an [[Albanians|Albanian]] revolt in 1359, and the territory of the former despotate became a component part of the personal Empire of Du\u0161an's brother [[Simeon Uro\u0161|Simeon Nemanji\u0107-Palailogos]]. Simeon was also governing Thessaly at the time, and, as the ''Chronicle of Ioannina'' shows, he left much of the territory under the control of Albanian clans establishing short-lived entities: the clan of [[Peter Losha|Peter Liosha]] held [[Despotate of Arta|Arta]], and the clan of [[Muriq Shpata]] held Aetoloacarnania, with [[Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto|Angelokastron]] as its capital.\n\nIn 1367 a part of the Epirotan Despotate was resurrected under local Serbian nobleman [[Thomas II Preljubovi\u0107]], who kept Ioannina. After Thomas' death in 1384, his widow remarried in 1385 and transferred the Despotate to homage of Italian nobility. The state tradition was carried on by the Serbian and Italian rulers of [[Ioannina]], who solicited aid from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] against the Albanians. In 1399 the Albanian leader of [[Principality of Gjirokast\u00ebr]], [[Gjon Zenebishi]] captured the Despot [[Esau de' Buondelmonti]] and released him after 15 months, when his relatives in Italy offered a huge amount of money as a ransom. By 1416 the [[Tocco family]] of [[Cephalonia]] succeeded in reuniting Epirus, or at least in asserting their control over its towns. But internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which proceeded with the capture of Ioannina in 1430, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] in 1449, [[Angelokastro (Aetolia-Acarnania)|Angelokastron]] in 1460, and finally [[Vonitsa]] in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was the end of Frankish rule in mainland [[Greece]].\n\n==Rulers==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=120\n | header            = Coats of arms of Epirote dynasties\n | image1            = Blason Orsini-Epirus.png\n | caption1          = [[Orsini dynasty]]\n | image2            = Coat of arms of the Nemanic Dynasty.svg\n | caption2          = [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]]\n | image3            = Buondelmonti.PNG\n | caption3          = [[Buondelmonti dynasty]]\n | image4            = Tocco stemma.png\n | caption4          = [[Tocco dynasty]]\n}}\n\n===Komnenos Doukas dynasty===\n*[[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] (1205\u20131214)\n*[[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] (1214\u20131230), emperor in Thessalonica from 1225 or 1227\n*[[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]] (1230\u20131271)\n*[[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] (1271\u20131297)\n*[[Thomas I Komnenos Doukas]] (1297\u20131318)\n\n===Orsini dynasty===\n*[[Nicholas Orsini]] (1318\u20131323)\n*[[John II Orsini|John Orsini]] (1323\u20131335)\n*[[Nikephoros II Orsini]] (1335\u20131337 and 1356\u20131359)\n\n===Nemanji\u0107 dynasty===\n{{Main|Nemanji\u0107 dynasty}}\n* [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], emperor ([[tsar]]) of Serbs and Greeks, conquered Epirus in 1347 and appointed his brother as governor \n* [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], governor of Epirus since 1347, and self-proclaimed emperor ([[tsar]]) of Serbs and Greeks since 1356\n* [[Thomas II Preljubovi\u0107]] (1367\u20131384), despot and lord of Epirus, son-in-law of tsar Simeon Uro\u0161\n* [[Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina]] (1384\u20131385), basilissa\n\n===Buondelmonti dynasty===\n*[[Esau de' Buondelmonti]] (1385\u20131411)\n*[[Giorgio de' Buondelmonti]] (1411)\n\n===Tocco dynasty===\n*[[Carlo I Tocco]] (1411\u20131429)\n*[[Carlo II Tocco]] (1429\u20131448), fall of Ioannina 1430\n*[[Leonardo III Tocco]] (1448\u20131479), fall of Arta 1449 and Angelokastron 1460\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp Jr.|authorlink=John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|origyear=1987|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=University of Michigan Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | encyclopedia = [[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford and New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | editor1-last = Arbel | editor1-first = Benjamin | editor2-last = Hamilton | editor2-first = Bernhard | editor3-last = Jacoby | editor3-first = David | title = Latins and Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204 | year = 1989 | publisher = Frank Cass & Co.

York asked Clark for his freedom based upon his good services during the expedition. According to one account discussed below, Clark eventually gave him his freedom.\n\n\"It is shown that York had gained a little freedom while on the expedition with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages, experiencing freedom while doing that. Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; [[Yorks Islands|York's Eight Islands]] and [[York's Dry Creek]], indicating that Clark may have respected him. When a poll was taken to decide where the group should stay over one winter, York's vote was recorded. He was also able to swim, unlike some of the men who were with them on their expedition.<ref>http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.dunnlib.simpson.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=3a67c719-8ccf-433b-9715-3faa4c9eeeef%40sessionmgr113&hid=101&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVybCx1aWQsY29va2llJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=6902662</ref>\n\nHe was very important to the expedition because the Native Americans worshiped him, so they were willing to trade with the rest of the expedition. Because of his dark skin, they thought he was the god of the black bear. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Later years and ultimate fate==\nAs to York's later life and death, semi-contemporaries [[Washington Irving]] and [[Zenas Leonard]] give contradictory accounts. When Irving interviewed Clark in 1832, Clark claimed to have freed York, but that York regretted being free because he was a failure at business, and died trying to get back to serve his master as a slave again in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Some contemporary historians doubt the accuracy of Clark's story, for it reflects pro-slavery arguments that Africans were happy to be slaves, and could not lead successful lives as free people.<ref>''York of the Corps of Discovery: Interpretations of York's Character and His Role in the Lewis and Clark Expedition''. Darrell Millner, Oregon Historical Quarterly, Fall 2003, pg 10, 13-4, 57.</ref> Others hold out the possibility that, as Clark's childhood playmate and long-time companion, the two men possessed a measure of friendship and mutual respect that was atypical for the time.<ref>''From Sea to Shining Sea''.

York asked Clark for his freedom based upon his good services during the expedition. According to one account discussed below, Clark eventually gave him his freedom.\n\n\"It is shown that York had gained a little freedom while on the expedition with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages, experiencing freedom while doing that. Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; [[Yorks Islands|York's Eight Islands]] and [[York's Dry Creek]], indicating that Clark may have respected him. When a poll was taken to decide where the group should stay over one winter, York's vote was recorded. He was also able to swim, unlike some of the men who were with them on their expedition.<ref>http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.dunnlib.simpson.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=3a67c719-8ccf-433b-9715-3faa4c9eeeef%40sessionmgr113&hid=101&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVybCx1aWQsY29va2llJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=6902662</ref>\n\nHe was very important to the expedition because the Native Americans worshiped him, so they were willing to trade with the rest of the expedition. Because of his dark skin, they thought he was the god of the black bear. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Later years and ultimate fate==\nAs to York's later life and death, semi-contemporaries [[Washington Irving]] and [[Zenas Leonard]] give contradictory accounts. When Irving interviewed Clark in 1832, Clark claimed to have freed York, but that York regretted being free because he was a failure at business, and died trying to get back to serve his master as a slave again in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Some contemporary historians doubt the accuracy of Clark's story, for it reflects pro-slavery arguments that Africans were happy to be slaves, and could not lead successful lives as free people.<ref>''York of the Corps of Discovery: Interpretations of York's Character and His Role in the Lewis and Clark Expedition''. Darrell Millner, Oregon Historical Quarterly, Fall 2003, pg 10, 13-4, 57.</ref> Others hold out the possibility that, as Clark's childhood playmate and long-time companion, the two men possessed a measure of friendship and mutual respect that was atypical for the time.<ref>''From Sea to Shining Sea''.
