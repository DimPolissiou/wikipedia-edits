In the years following [[World War II]], the population increased, and there were many new houses and apartment complexes built.  A portion of the Downtown area was devastated by a major fire in 1962.  Education at the Middle and High School level was regionalized in 1968, and a new elementary school was also built (Memorial School).\n\nThe 1990s saw a population boom in Warren County, which continues today, as high real estate prices and property taxes in New Jersey's northeastern counties push buyers to look further west.  Although the borough itself does not have much room to grow, it has benefited from the growth of the nearby townships. Efforts are underway to revitalize the downtown with new residential and retail properties.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Washington borough had a total area of 1.945 square miles (5.039&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 1.942 square miles (5.030&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.003 square miles (0.009&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water (0.18%).<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name=\"GR1\" />\n\nThe borough of Washington is completely surrounded by [[Washington Township, Warren County, New Jersey|Washington Township]],<ref>[https://global.mapit.mysociety.org/area/82846/touches.html Areas touching Washington], MapIt.

The [[Morris Canal]] ran along the north end of town and two rail lines of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] crossed within the borough.  Intersecting in the center of the borough are two major roadways, which today are [[New Jersey Route 31|Route 31]] and [[New Jersey Route 57|Route 57]]. The borough was ultimately named for the \"Washington House\", a tavern built by Revolutionary War Col. William McCullough in 1811 that was later destroyed by fire in 1869.<ref>[http://history.rays-place.com/nj/war-washington-borough.htm History of Washington Borough, NJ] Accessed April 18, 2011.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the borough became a mecca of musical instruments manufacturers, the manufacture of organs in particular.  A bustling downtown developed around these businesses.  Many of the Victorian style houses in the borough, as well as Taylor Street School and Warren Hills Middle School (formerly Washington High School) were built during this period.\n\nThe advent of the automobile brought Washington closer to both the [[Lehigh Valley]] and [[New York City]].  In the years following [[World War II]], the population increased, and there were many new houses and apartment complexes built.  A portion of the Downtown area was devastated by a major fire in 1962.  Education at the Middle and High School level was regionalized in 1968, and a new elementary school was also built (Memorial School).\n\nThe 1990s saw a population boom in Warren County, which continues today, as high real estate prices and property taxes in New Jersey's northeastern counties push buyers to look further west.  Although the borough itself does not have much room to grow, it has benefited from the growth of the nearby townships. Efforts are underway to revitalize the downtown with new residential and retail properties.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Washington borough had a total area of 1.945 square miles (5.039&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 1.942 square miles (5.030&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.003 square miles (0.009&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water (0.18%).<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name=\"GR1\" />\n\nThe borough of Washington is completely surrounded by [[Washington Township, Warren County, New Jersey|Washington Township]],<ref>[https://global.mapit.mysociety.org/area/82846/touches.html Areas touching Washington], MapIt.

In 1791, they cleared trees and built a [[log cabin]].\n\n===Coal mining===\n[[Coal mining]] was the chief industry in the [[Coal Region|region]]. In 1864, the Warrior Run Mining Company was organized; it reopened the old Holland and Hillman mine. The company constructed a [[coal breaker|breaker]] at the foot of the mountain which opened in 1867. At about the same time, both the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the Nanticoke Branch of the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] completed their lines through the area, thus making it possible to conveniently mine, transport, and market the area's coal. Ultimately, in the 20th century, the coal industry in the region died out.\n\n===Borough===\nWarrior Run Mining Village arose on the land owned by the Warrior Run Mining Company. On January 25, 1895, the Borough of Warrior Run was incorporated.

In 1791, they cleared trees and built a [[log cabin]].\n\n===Coal mining===\n[[Coal mining]] was the chief industry in the [[Coal Region|region]]. In 1864, the Warrior Run Mining Company was organized; it reopened the old Holland and Hillman mine. The company constructed a [[coal breaker|breaker]] at the foot of the mountain which opened in 1867. At about the same time, both the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the Nanticoke Branch of the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] completed their lines through the area, thus making it possible to conveniently mine, transport, and market the area's coal. Ultimately, in the 20th century, the coal industry in the region died out.\n\n===Borough===\nWarrior Run Mining Village arose on the land owned by the Warrior Run Mining Company. On January 25, 1895, the Borough of Warrior Run was incorporated.

Since 1962, children in Wampum proper and Chewton have attend [[Ellwood City Area School District]], which is considered the legal successor to Wampum Public Schools due to state-mandated school consolidation in the 1960s. Due to a dispute with the former Big Beaver Township School District that had an informal union with Wampum Public Schools but never fully merged with Wampum, children in New Beaver have attended Big

The property, on the south bank of [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River)|Turtle Creek]], was passed to James' sons Henry and John Walls, who lived in a [[log cabin]] near the heart of present-day Wall.  A station on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] opened in the early 1840s, which was named \"Walls' Station\" in honor of the Walls family.  Eventually, the name of the station and the town that grew up around it was shortened to \"Wall Station\".  Henry and John Walls sold their property to their cousin [[Frank Wall (steamboat engineer)|Frank Wall]], an [[engineer]] on [[riverboat]]s who developed the property around the station.  Wall got its name after this Frank Wall, whose said property development led to him being the owner of the first two houses erected in the region.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IDdaF-3HBsC&lpg=PA505&dq=Frank%20Wall%20Pittsburgh&pg=PA505#v=onepage&q&f=false Cushing, Thomas.
