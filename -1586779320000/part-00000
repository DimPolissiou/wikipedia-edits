They get caught by CODEX and finally meet \"Titan\", which turns out to be Mac's aunt, Gwendolyn \"Gwen\" Hayes, a former DXS Agent thought to have been killed. She explains the state of the world has forced scientists to \"play God\" and tries to persuade Mac to join her, but it fails.

Riley tracks down Paige, now a successful tech entrepreneur, to get the master key. She is able to reboot power plant computers, but during the reboot, someone takes over the computers and starts a sequence to trigger a meltdown. While Mac and the team devise a contraption to provide core cooling and buy time, Paige and Desi locate Kai, who was caught on video tapping into the county power grid. Kai says she was paid by someone, which turns out to be Paige, who orchestrated the attack for CODEX. Although they save the city and over four million people from a meltdown, Mac is forced to sacrifice the power plant supervisor's life while he was trying to close down the nitrogen tubes manually. Riley visits Kai in prison and thanks her for helping take down Paige. Mac and Russ watch a video that Jimmy MacGyver left in case of his death.

In Crestone, he contributed to a number of summer schools for Lindisfarne and taught alongside innovative thinkers from both the arts and sciences, including social philosopher and cultural critic, [[William Irwin Thompson]] (founder of the Lindisfarne Association), mythographer and symbolist [[Robert Lawlor]], poet and environmental activist [[Wendell Berry]], biologist [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], and environmentalist [[James Lovelock]].\n\nCritchlow founded the Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts (VITA) department in 1984,<ref name=\"MALE1990\" /> which moved from the Royal College of Art to The Prince's Institute of Architecture in 1992\u20133, where he was director of research.

The minbar was destroyed by fire in 1969 following an arson attack by an evangelical Christian. King Hussein of Jordan launched a 30-year search, including international competitions, to find a sufficiently qualified person to re-design the intricate patterns of the minbar. The competition was finally won by Dr Minwer Al-Meheid<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meehan|first=Mark W.|title=Islam, Modernity, and the Liminal Space Between|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Newcastle Upon Tyne|pages=96-97}}</ref> who was inspired by the work of Critchlow:<blockquote>\"Seemingly, the ancient knowledge of how to map the structure geometrically had been lost. Until, that is, Minwer al-Meheid, an engineer from Jordan, walked into a bookshop in Damascus and fell upon a work that contained the answers.

He worked with Marks Barfield Architects on the design of the [[Cambridge Central Mosque]], Europe's first eco-friendly mosque<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cambridgecentralmosque.org/|title=Cambridge Central Mosque|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref>. The underlying geometry of the mosque, \u2019the breath of the compassionate\u2019, which is rooted in Islamic tradition, was designed by Critchlow.
