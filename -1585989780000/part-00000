His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

Works included ''[[Basket of Bread]]'', ''Atomic and Uranian Melancholic Ideal'', and ''My Wife Nude Contemplating her own Body Transformed into Steps, the Three Vertebrae of a Column Sky and Architecture''.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss his marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory, Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory, Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2018-12-11}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2018-12-11}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Freeknowledgecreator", "label": "safe", "comment": "correct punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}

Originally catering for boys in primary to intermediate years (Years 1-10), the school would not go on to teach Secondary (Years 7-12) years until 1965 and then in 2021 would change again to educate both girls and boys from Kindergarten through to Year 12.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMarist Brothers High School North Sydney was originally opened in response to the educational needs of the poor in the North Sydney area, which was, at the time, a low socioeconomic area. The school was the fourth Marist School opened in Australia after Church Hill (1872), Parramatta (1875) and Hunters Hill (1881) and had a teaching staff of three Brothers and an enrolment of 65 boys. The school initially started as a two-room campus on the site of what is now the St Mary's Campus (Ridge Street).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school was established with the motto ''\u201cEsse Non Videri\u201d'' (Latin), which is translated to, ''\u201cto be, not to seem\u201d.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1916 the school's enrolments had reached an excess of 300 students and the limited campus was inadequate to educate comfortably. In response to this, the school moved sites to what is now the La Valla Campus (Carlow Street) but had previously been a local business, Mark Foy's Furniture Repository before 1916. It had been purchased by the Parish Priest at the time, Fr. Cornish SJ and converted into classrooms and a hall known as the Manresa Hall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next major change to the school was in response to the 1965 Wyndham Scheme which saw the merging of Marist Brothers Mosman and Marist Brothers High School North Sydney to create a completely new school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe new school was named Marist College North Shore and would be a Secondary school (Years 7-12) for boys in the North Sydney and Mosman area. The college adopted the colours blue, black and gold and the former Marist Brothers Mosman school motto, \u201c''Virtus Ubique Vincit\u201d'' (Latin) meaning \u201c''Courage Conquers All\u201d.\u00a0'' This change of school saw a complete redesign and construction of the campus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1996 the La Valla Centre was opened for use as a multi purpose educational facility comprising a hall, art rooms, computer laboratories, music classrooms and practice rooms, Design and Technology workshops, and other assorted facilities and offices. In 2007 the most recent building project was completed. The Coyle Centre contains a new library, additional classrooms, and food technology kitchens. In addition several buildings and sections of the school were given names such as the Mosman Wing in homage to Marist Brothers Mosman and the Manresa Courts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.maristcollege.com/our-college/our-history/|title=Our History {{!}}|website=Marist College North Shore|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Marist has announced it will be converting to a  co-educational school by 2021.

We must endeavour to give voice to those Brothers and Sisters who cannot be heard and try to become the Lord's hands and feet on earth so that all members of our family are treated with respect and dignity.\n* '''A Love of Work''' \u2013 Whatever one is called to do, may each boy realise the value of living lives of integrity and compassion and always seek to do the Lord's work. It is important to value the opportunities that are given and maintain faith in the work when difficult times arise.\n* '''In the Way of Mary''' \u2013 Mary, the Mother of God, is our model of faith as each student comes to know their own faith as they journey through their secondary education and beyond...''in the Marist tradition.''\n\n== Vision for learning ==\nLaunched in 2017, the vision for learning at Marist College North Shore is Dare to be. This vision is split into four categories;\n\n* Dare to be '''relational'''\n* Dare to be '''challenged'''\n* Dare to be '''engaged'''\n* Dare to be '''deep thinkers'''\n\n[[File:D2B-100.jpg|thumb|DARE TO BE crest]]\n\n== Theme ==\nEvery year the College Student Leadership Team commissions a central theme for the school to conduct learning around.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Themes\n!Year\n!Banner\n!Central Theme\n!Accompanying Themes\n!Quote\n|-\n|2014\n|[[File:Theme 2014.png|thumb|Theme banner for 2014]]\n|Service\n|Courage, Respect, Presence\n|\"As each of you receive a gift, use it to serve one another\"\n1 Peter 4:10\n|-\n|2015\n|[[File:Theme 2015.png|thumb|Theme banner for 2015]]\n|Love\n|Respect, Empathy, Justice, Dignity\n|\"Abide in my Love...\"\nJohn 15:9\n|-\n|2016\n|[[File:Theme 2016.png|thumb|Theme banner for 2016]]\n|Presence\n|Respect, Compassion, Mercy, Faith\n|\"Stand firm in your faith, be courageous, be strong.\"\n1 Corinthians 16:13\n|-\n|2017\n|\n|Unity\n|Humility, Challenge, Justice, Respect\n|\u201cFor you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.\u201d\nMatthew 23:8\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|Imagine\n|Respect, Presence, Integrity, Action\n|\u201cAll things are possible for one who believes\"\nMark 9:23\n|-\n|2019\n|[[File:Theme 2019.jpg|thumb|Theme banner for 2019]]\n|Embrace\n|Respect, Identity, Compassion, Resilience\n|\"Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you.\"\nRomans 15:7\n|-\n|2020\n|[[File:Theme 2020.jpg|thumb|Theme banner for 2020]]\n|Courage\n|Gratitude, Respect, Spirit, Action\n|\"Be strong, courageous and act.\"\n1Chronicles 28:20\n|}\n\n== Motto ==\nThe schools motto is \"Virtus Ubique Vincit\" which is Latin for \"Courage Conquers All\".\n\nWhen the school was initially established it had the motto ''Esse Non Videri\u201d'' , which was Latin for, ''\u201cto be, not to seem\u201d.'' \n[[File:Courage Conquers All.png|center|thumb|300x300px|Courage Conquers All -

He was a [[missionary]] to the [[Pacific]] and was martyred on the Island of [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]].\n\n'''Motto''': Unity, Passion, Commitment.\n\n'''Colour''': Red.\n\n=== Kelly ===\nNamed in honour of Fr. Michael Kelly SJ the Parish Priest of North Sydney who provided the original inspiration for the establishment of the College by persistently inviting the Brothers to commence a school in the Parish.\n\n'''Colour''': Green (black before 2007).\n\n'''Motto''': Service, Knowledge, Strength.\n\n=== MacKillop ===\nNamed after St [[Mary Mackillop]], Australia's first saint.\n\n'''Colour''': Orange.\n\n'''Motto''': Courage, Commitment, Compassion.\n\n=== Montagne ===\nNamed after the man whose death inspired St Marcellin Champagnat, the founder of the Marist Brothers, to begin his work for the poor.\n\n'''Colour''': Purple.\n\n'''Motto''': Faith Through Action.\n\n=== Moore ===\nNamed in honour of the College's first Headmaster, Walter Moore, who had the responsibility of establishing a new school and beginning the proud tradition of Marist Education north of the Harbour.\n\n'''Colour''': Blue.\n\n'''Motto''': Success Through Determination.\n\n=== Salta ===\nNamed in honour of Peter Salta, ex-student and staff member of the College. Peter attended the school as a boy and then returned as a staff member in 1967. He was the longest serving member of staff, finishing teaching duties in 1999.\n\n'''Colour''': Gold.\n\n'''Motto''': Life, Love, Loyalty\n\nIn previous years and in certain circumstances the college opened a special extra house:\n\n=== Ludovic ===\nUsually if the intake of Year Seven students in a particular year is significantly larger than normal, an extra house is opened, often called Ludovic. It is a special house in that it does not have a specific House Coordinator, Senior Captains leadership team, house colour or emblem. Rather the students consist of an even distribution amongst the six main houses and are placed in the Ludovic House for administrative purposes only. This class is an extension class for English students based on exams & Naplan results. Ludovic has been discontinued as of 2017.\n\nPrior to 2006, the four college houses were Chanel, Xavier, Marcellin and Sykes. However, after an extensive review, an overhaul of the house and pastoral systems resulted in significant structural changes and greater emphasis on intra-house relationships and less so on Year groups as collectives. The houses were subsequently renamed; Xavier became Kelly, Marcellin became Moore and Sykes became Salta. The only House that retained its name in the overhaul was Chanel. The house colours of the previous four houses was retained for their successors. The previous posts of Year Seven to Twelve Coordinators were abolished and four House Coordinators were established in their places.\n\nIn 2014, the school decided to increase the number of houses from four to six. The new houses of Mackillop and Montagne were established, becoming functional in 2015.\n\nAll house are to be discontinued and replaced in 2021.\n<gallery>\nFile:Chanel-crest-only.jpg|Chanel House Crest\nFile:Kelly-crest.jpg|Kelly House Crest\nFile:MacKillop-crest-motto-w.jpg|MacKillop House Crest\nFile:Montagne-crest-motto-w.jpg|Montagne House Crest\nFile:Moore-crest-motto-w.jpg|Moore House Crest\nFile:Salta-crest-motto-k-e1512017094426.jpg|Salta House Crest\n</gallery>\n\n== Timetable structure ==\nThe college follows a two-week timetable with each day consisting of 5 one hour periods.

Originally catering for boys in primary to intermediate years (Years 1-10), the school would not go on to teach Secondary (Years 7-12) years until 1965 and then in 2021 would change again to educate both girls and boys from Kindergarten through to Year 12.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMarist Brothers High School North Sydney was originally opened in response to the educational needs of the poor in the North Sydney area, which was, at the time, a low socioeconomic area. The school was the fourth Marist School opened in Australia after Church Hill (1872), Parramatta (1875) and Hunters Hill (1881) and had a teaching staff of three Brothers and an enrolment of 65 boys. The school initially started as a two-room campus on the site of what is now the St Mary's Campus (Ridge Street).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school was established with the motto ''\u201cEsse Non Videri\u201d'' (Latin), which is translated to, ''\u201cto be, not to seem\u201d.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1916 the school's enrolments had reached an excess of 300 students and the limited campus was inadequate to educate comfortably. In response to this, the school moved sites to what is now the La Valla Campus (Carlow Street) but had previously been a local business, Mark Foy's Furniture Repository before 1916. It had been purchased by the Parish Priest at the time, Fr. Cornish SJ and converted into classrooms and a hall known as the Manresa Hall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe next major change to the school was in response to the 1965 Wyndham Scheme which saw the merging of Marist Brothers Mosman and Marist Brothers High School North Sydney to create a completely new school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe new school was named Marist College North Shore and would be a Secondary school (Years 7-12) for boys in the North Sydney and Mosman area. The college adopted the colours blue, black and gold and the former Marist Brothers Mosman school motto, \u201c''Virtus Ubique Vincit\u201d'' (Latin) meaning \u201c''Courage Conquers All\u201d.\u00a0'' This change of school saw a complete redesign and construction of the campus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1996 the La Valla Centre was opened for use as a multi purpose educational facility comprising a hall, art rooms, computer laboratories, music classrooms and practice rooms, Design and Technology workshops, and other assorted facilities and offices. In 2007 the most recent building project was completed. The Coyle Centre contains a new library, additional classrooms, and food technology kitchens. In addition several buildings and sections of the school were given names such as the Mosman Wing in homage to Marist Brothers Mosman and the Manresa Courts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.maristcollege.com/our-college/our-history/|title=Our History {{!}}|website=Marist College North Shore|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Marist has announced it will be converting to a  co-educational school by 2021.

We must endeavour to give voice to those Brothers and Sisters who cannot be heard and try to become the Lord's hands and feet on earth so that all members of our family are treated with respect and dignity.\n* '''A Love of Work''' \u2013 Whatever one is called to do, may each boy realise the value of living lives of integrity and compassion and always seek to do the Lord's work. It is important to value the opportunities that are given and maintain faith in the work when difficult times arise.\n* '''In the Way of Mary''' \u2013 Mary, the Mother of God, is our model of faith as each student comes to know their own faith as they journey through their secondary education and beyond...''in the Marist tradition.''\n\n== Vision for learning ==\nLaunched in 2017, the vision for learning at Marist College North Shore is Dare to be. This vision is split into four categories;\n\n* Dare to be '''relational'''\n* Dare to be '''challenged'''\n* Dare to be '''engaged'''\n* Dare to be '''deep

Houses]]\nThe college updated the houses at the start of 2016 moving from the traditional four to six houses:\n\n=== Chanel ===\nNamed in honour of St [[Peter Chanel]], one of the earliest [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] and the first Marist Saint. He was a [[missionary]] to the [[Pacific]] and was martyred on the Island of [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]].\n\n'''Motto''': Unity, Passion, Commitment.\n\n'''Colour''': Red.\n\n=== Kelly ===\nNamed in honour of Fr. Michael Kelly SJ the Parish Priest of North Sydney who provided the original inspiration for the establishment of the College by persistently inviting the Brothers to commence a school in the Parish.\n\n'''Colour''': Green (black before 2007).\n\n'''Motto''': Service, Knowledge, Strength.\n\n=== MacKillop ===\nNamed after St [[Mary Mackillop]], Australia's first saint.\n\n'''Colour''': Orange.\n\n'''Motto''': Courage, Commitment, Compassion.\n\n=== Montagne ===\nNamed after the man whose death inspired St Marcellin Champagnat, the founder of the Marist Brothers, to begin his work for the poor.\n\n'''Colour''': Purple.\n\n'''Motto''': Faith Through Action.\n\n=== Moore ===\nNamed in honour of the College's first Headmaster, Walter Moore, who had the responsibility of establishing a new school and beginning the proud tradition of Marist Education north of the Harbour.\n\n'''Colour''': Blue.\n\n'''Motto''': Success Through Determination.\n\n=== Salta ===\nNamed in honour of Peter Salta, ex-student and staff member of the College. Peter attended the school as a boy and then returned as a staff member in 1967. He was the longest serving member of staff, finishing teaching duties in 1999.\n\n'''Colour''': Gold.\n\n'''Motto''': Life, Love, Loyalty\n\nIn previous years and in certain circumstances the college opened a special extra house:\n\n=== Ludovic ===\nUsually if the intake of Year Seven students in a particular year is significantly larger than normal, an extra house is opened, often called Ludovic. It is a special house in that it does not have a specific House Coordinator, Senior Captains leadership team, house colour or emblem. Rather the students consist of an even distribution amongst the six main houses and are placed in the Ludovic House for administrative purposes only. This class is an extension class for English students based on exams & Naplan results. Ludovic has been discontinued as of 2017.\n\nPrior to 2006, the four college houses were Chanel, Xavier, Marcellin and Sykes. However, after an extensive review, an overhaul of the house and pastoral systems resulted in significant structural changes and greater emphasis on intra-house relationships and less so on Year groups as collectives. The houses were subsequently renamed; Xavier became Kelly, Marcellin became Moore and Sykes became Salta. The only House that retained its name in the overhaul was Chanel. The house colours of the previous four houses was retained for their successors. The previous posts of Year Seven to Twelve Coordinators were abolished and four House Coordinators were established in their places.\n\nIn 2014, the school decided to increase the number of houses from four to six. The new houses of Mackillop and Montagne were established, becoming functional in 2015.\n\nAll house are to be discontinued and replaced in 2021.\n<gallery>\nFile:Chanel-crest-only.jpg|Chanel House Crest\nFile:Kelly-crest.jpg|Kelly House Crest\nFile:MacKillop-crest-motto-w.jpg|MacKillop House Crest\nFile:Montagne-crest-motto-w.jpg|Montagne House Crest\nFile:Moore-crest-motto-w.jpg|Moore House Crest\nFile:Salta-crest-motto-k-e1512017094426.jpg|Salta House Crest\n</gallery>\n\n== Timetable structure ==\nThe college follows a two-week timetable with each day consisting of 5 one hour periods.
