The name was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimization, which is a major feature of Gentoo. Gentoo package management is designed to be [[Modular programming|modular]], [[porting|portable]], easy to maintain, and flexible.

Each package contains details of any dependencies on other software, so only the minimum set need be installed to run the required applications.

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]).

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams. However, if so desired, a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage3 installation, effectively simulating the old bootstrap process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#Bootstrapping_the_Base_System_.28Optional_but_Recommended.29|title=Sakaki's EFI Install Guide/Building the Gentoo Base System Minus Kernel|publisher=Sakaki|date=2014-07-04|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gentoo Reference Platform===\nFrom 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins (computer programmer)|Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2018-02-10|work=[[OSNews]]}}</ref> These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2018-02-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108142459/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

As of 2015, there are a total of 64 bids possible (22 automatic qualifiers, 42 at-large).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_champs_records/2013/d2/elite8.pdf|title=Division II Men's Basketball Championship|website=NCAA.org|publisher=NCAA}}</ref>\n\n== Team appearances ==\n===Current Division II members===\n* Appearances include those made by schools in the NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament, the direct predecessor to the current Division II and [[NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament|Division III]] tournaments. The NCAA did not adopt its current three-division alignment until the 1973\u201374 school year, when the College Division was split into Divisions II and III.\n* School names reflect those in current use by their respective athletic programs, not necessarily those used when a school made an appearance in the Division II tournament. For example, [[Jefferson Rams men's basketball|Jefferson]] was known as ''Philadelphia College of Textiles & Science'' (athletically \"Philadelphia Textile\") when it won its NCAA title in [[1970 NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament|1970]], and [[Omaha Mavericks men's basketball|Omaha]] used its institutional identity of [[University of Nebraska Omaha|Nebraska\u2013Omaha]] when it made all of its D-II tournament appearances. \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In 1762 the company was merged with, and for a time took the name of its chief rival the '''[[Com\u00e9die-Italienne]]''' at the [[H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (theatre)|H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne]], and was also called the '''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien''' up to about 1793, when it again became most commonly known as the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Today the company's official name is '''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique''', and its theatre, with a capacity of around 1,248 seats, sometimes referred to as the [[Salle Favart]] (the third on this site), is located in [[Place Bo\u00efeldieu]], in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]], not far from the [[Palais Garnier]], one of the theatres of the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]]. The musicians and others associated with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique have made important contributions to operatic history and tradition in France, and to French opera. Its current mission is to reconnect with its history, and discover its unique repertoire, to ensure production and dissemination of operas for the wider public.<ref>Op\u00e9ra-Comique website accessed on 26 November 2010.</ref> Mainstays of the repertory at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique during its history have included the following works which have each been performed more than 1,000 times by the company: ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', ''[[Le chalet]]'', ''[[La dame blanche]]'', ''[[Le domino noir]]'', ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]'', ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'', ''[[Manon]]'', ''[[Mignon]]'', ''[[Les noces de Jeannette]]'', ''[[Le pr\u00e9 aux clercs]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'', ''[[Werther]]'' and ''[[Carmen]]'', the last having been performed more than 2,500 times.<ref name=\"Wolff\">Wolff 1953.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Frontispiece for Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire by Lesage vol1 1730 - Hearst 2004 p137.jpg|thumb|The [[Muse]] of Comedy assembles Poetry, Music, and Dance to form Op\u00e9ra Comique (1722)]]\n\n{{See also|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire}}\nSince the [[Middle Ages]] popular light theatrical entertainments had been a part of the seasonal Parisian fairs, especially the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent. They included farces, tightrope acts, acrobatics, and marionettes, and also included music, such as ''[[Vaudeville (song)|vaudevilles]]'' and popular songs. The audiences were diverse, from all levels of society, and the presentations were given on makeshift stages. However, with the establishment in 1672 of [[King Louis XIV]]'s [[Acad\u00e9mie royale de Musique]] (popularly known as the Op\u00e9ra) under [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], the use of music by fair troupes was significantly curtailed.<ref name=HW858to60>Harris-Warrick 1992, pp. 858&ndash;860.</ref><ref name=Pitou24to25>Pitou 1983, vol. 1, pp. 24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Com\u00e9die-Italienne|Italian players]] at the [[H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (theatre)|H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne]] were banished from Paris in 1697 for performing their comedy ''La fausse prude'' (\"The False Prude\"), which satirized the King's mistress, [[Madame de Maintenon]], the fair theatres were quick to adopt much of the Italians' repertory, which included parodies of operas and tragedies. The fair theatres were soon viewed as competition by the Op\u00e9ra and the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and restrictions were again more strictly enforced. The troupes at the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent received warnings from the police in 1699 and 1706. Although in 1708 the fairground entrepreneurs Charles Alard and Maurice were able to purchase from the Op\u00e9ra's director [[Pierre Guyenet]] the right to use singers, dancers, musicians, and sets, this did not last as Guyenet died in 1712, leaving the Op\u00e9ra with a debt in the neighborhood of 400,000 livres. Alard resorted to giving silent performances with the actors' speeches displayed to the audience on large cue cards. The players next tried including vaudeville airs via audience participation: the musicians would play a popular tune, and the spectators would sing, while the actors remained silent. This was further enhanced when the words began to be displayed to the audience on a large banner.<ref name=HW858to60/><ref name=Pitou24to25/><ref name=Johnson>Johnson 2008, p. 162&ndash;163.</ref><ref>Wild 1992, p. 586.</ref>\n\n==Foundation and early history==\n[[File:Favart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|<center>Favart</center>]]\nIn 1713 and 1714 several of the fair troupes were able to conclude a new series of agreements with the creditors of the deceased Guyenet, who at this point had become the managers of the rather expensive Op\u00e9ra. For an annual fee the troupes obtained the right to perform light comedies interspersed with songs and dances and to use sets and theatre machines.<ref name=Johnson/> They were also given the right to use the name \"Op\u00e9ra-Comique\". The first work officially given that designation was ''T\u00e9l\u00e9maque'' (a parody of the opera by [[Andr\u00e9 Cardinal Destouches]]), which was first performed by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire#Foire Saint-Germain|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Foire Saint-Germain]] in 1715. The words were by [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage]], the music was arranged by Jean-Claude Gillier, and the orchestra consisted of 15 players. Lesage authored many of the early ''op\u00e9ras comiques'', and composers like Gillier worked primarily as arrangers of existing music.<ref name=HW858to60/><ref name=WW1996>Warrack and West 1996, p. 376.

[[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] may also have been the leader of the orchestra. The company was, however, too successful, and the Op\u00e9ra refused to renew Monnet's privilege in 1745. After working briefly in Lyon, and mounting unsuccessful productions in Dijon (1746) and London (1749), he was able to repurchase the Op\u00e9ra-Comique ''privil\u00e8ge'' in December 1751 and remained its director until 1757.<ref name=Cook>Cook 1992, p. 436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Le diable \u00e0 quatre - Michel Sedaine - NGO3-863.jpg|thumb|A scene from ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'' with text by Michel-Jean Sedaine]]\nDuring his second period as director, Monnet continued to work with Favart and Noverre, and Boucher designed and built a substantial new theatre for the company of the Foire Saint-Laurent in 1752. The theatre was later installed in a wing of the [[Salle des Menus-Plaisirs (rue Berg\u00e8re)|H\u00f4tel des Menus-Plaisirs]] on the rue Berg\u00e8re, where it was used by the Op\u00e9ra in 1781,<ref>Gourret 1985, pp. 81\u201384</ref> and then as the first concert hall of the [[Paris Conservatory]], which was founded on the same site in 1795.<ref>Simeone 2000, p. 214.</ref>  The new theatre was especially important, as it enabled the company to perform at times when the fair was not in operation. Monnet's friend [[Jean-Joseph Vad\u00e9]] wrote the libretto for ''[[Les troqueurs]]'', first staged in July 1753 and advertised as a translation of an Italian work. The music was actually original, composed by [[Antoine Dauvergne]], and began a period of new works in a more Italian style in which music played a much more significant role. Composers for the company during this period included [[Egidio Duni]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor]] and [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny]].<ref name=HW863/><ref name=Cook/>\n\nThe dramatist [[Michel-Jean Sedaine]] wrote the text of his first opera for the company, ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'',  in 1756. It premiered at the Fair Saint-Laurent on 19 August with verses for the ''ariettes'' provided by Pierre Baurans and with music parodying a variety of composers including [[Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi]], Duni, [[Baldassare Galuppi]], and [[Giuseppe Scarlatti]], and also included music attributed to the French composers Jean-Louis Laurette and Philidor. [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was later to compose his own music for the work. [[Le diable \u00e0 quatre (opera)|His version]] was first given in Laxenburg, Austria, on 28 May 1759. Other settings were later composed for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique by [[Bernardo Porta]] (14 February 1790)<ref>The music and libretto for Bernardo Porta's version of ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'' have not been found.</ref> and [[Jean-Pierre Soli\u00e9]] (30 November 1809).<ref>Wild and Charlton 2005, p. 221.</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|1762}}1762 to 1807==\n[[File:Salle Favart I - Pugin & Heath 1829 after p24 - IA (adjusted).jpg|thumb|The first ''Salle Favart'' which housed the company between 1783 and 1801]]\n\nOn 3 February 1762 the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was merged into the [[Com\u00e9die-Italienne]] and occupied the [[H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (theatre)|H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne]],<ref>Charlton 1986, p. 6.</ref> gaining in respectability what it lost in independence. The company was renamed to Op\u00e9ra-Comique by an edict of the king in 1780, although the names Com\u00e9die-Italienne and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien were still used frequently by the press and public for many years thereafter. In 1783 the company moved again, into the Salle Favart (architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Heurtier; ca. 1,100 seats) on the site where the current theatre stands. Around that time the works of [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try|Gr\u00e9try]] featured strongly.<ref name=HW863/><ref>Opera-Comique website: Historique, accessed 3 April 2009.</ref>\n\nWith the proliferation of opera houses after the Law of 1791 which removed restrictions on the opening of theatres, there was competition with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau]], which was resolved in 1801 by merger. By 1807 Napoleon had reduced theatrical freedoms, and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was named one of four primary theatres in Paris.\n\n==The 19th century==\n[[File:Salle Favart Fire 1887 NGOp878.jpg|thumb|Fire at the second ''Salle Favart'' on {{nowrap|25 May 1887}} (engraving).]]\n\nFrench ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]'', in the 19th century at least, was not necessarily comic; the term covered a much wider category of work. Notable composers in the history of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique  include [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy|Hal\u00e9vy]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]. After Rossini's arrival in Paris, new works at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique took in Italian vocal style and techniques, leading to greater virtuosity, although \"the repertory as a whole stood as a bulwark against the italianate invasion of Rossini\".<ref>David Charlton. Paris \u00a74 (iii) The Op\u00e9ra-Comique. In: [[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]], (Ed.) Sadie S., London & New York: Macmillan, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn 1840, the Op\u00e9ra-Comique company settled in the second Salle Favart (architect Louis Charpentier; 1,500 seats), built on the site of the first theatre, destroyed by fire in 1838. The new house was inaugurated with a revival of H\u00e9rold's ''[[Le Pr\u00e9 aux clercs]]''. During the 1850s and 1860s the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] offered competition in the type of repertoire staged, being particularly strong in its policy of new commissions.\n\nPerformances took place on most evenings of the week except for major festivals. Boxes could be hired for a year at a time, and many subscribers were wealthy. Before 1848 a third of subscribers were of the aristocracy, but after then it became an especially middle class theatre. After 1848 [[\u00c9mile Perrin]] sought to revive the repertoire with more literary and ambitious works. Until 1864 its repertoire was still prescribed, by statute, to have spoken dialogue between musical numbers.<ref name=HW1992>Harris-Warrick 1992.</ref>\n\nThe Op\u00e9ra-Comique staged the first performances of such important French works as Berlioz's ''[[The Damnation of Faust]]'' (1846), Thomas' ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' (1875). In the latter part of the century the theatre revived works it had made its own, restaged works from the repertoire of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique (which had closed in 1872) and premiered new pieces, such as Offenbach's ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]'' (1881); Delibes' ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'' (1883); Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'' (1884), ''[[Esclarmonde]]'' (1889), and ''[[Werther]]'' (French premiere in 1893); and Charpentier's ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' (1900).\n\nA fire at the Salle Favart on 25 May 1887 resulted in the death of 84 people by asphyxiation. The building was destroyed and the director [[L\u00e9on Carvalho]] was forced to resign, although later he was acquitted of blame and resumed the helm at the company from 1891 to 1897. The third Salle Favart (architect [[Louis Bernier]]) was officially opened in the presence of President [[F\u00e9lix Faure]] on 7 December 1898.\n\n==The 20th century and beyond==\nAs the differences between op\u00e9ra and op\u00e9ra comique faded, the two main houses in Paris came more into competition, although the Salle Favart saw the premieres of more innovative works: Debussy's ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' (1902), Dukas' ''[[Ariane et Barbe-bleue]]'' (1907), Ravel's ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'' (1911), and French premieres of works by Puccini and Falla. Between 1900 and 1950, 401 works by 206 different composers were performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, of which 222 were either world premieres (136) or the first performance in Paris (86).<ref name=Wolff/>\n\nIn June 1936 a broadcast of ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann'' was disrupted by the start of a company sit-in demanding the director's resignation.<ref>Nichols R.

Today the company's official name is '''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique''', and its theatre, with a capacity of around 1,248 seats, sometimes referred to as the [[Salle Favart]] (the third on this site), is located in [[Place Bo\u00efeldieu]], in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]], not far from the [[Palais Garnier]], one of the theatres of the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]]. The musicians and others associated with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique have made important contributions to operatic history and tradition in France, and to French opera. Its current mission is to reconnect with its history, and discover its unique repertoire, to ensure production and dissemination of operas for the wider public.<ref>Op\u00e9ra-Comique website accessed on 26 November 2010.</ref> Mainstays of the repertory at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique during its history have included the following works which have each been performed more than 1,000 times by the company: ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', ''[[Le chalet]]'', ''[[La dame blanche]]'', ''[[Le domino noir]]'', ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]'', ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'', ''[[Manon]]'', ''[[Mignon]]'', ''[[Les noces de Jeannette]]'', ''[[Le pr\u00e9 aux clercs]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'', ''[[Werther]]'' and ''[[Carmen]]'', the last having been performed more than 2,500 times.<ref name=\"Wolff\">Wolff 1953.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Frontispiece for Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire by Lesage vol1 1730 - Hearst 2004 p137.jpg|thumb|The [[Muse]] of Comedy assembles Poetry, Music, and Dance to form Op\u00e9ra Comique (1722)]]\n\n{{See also|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire}}\nSince the [[Middle Ages]] popular light theatrical entertainments had been a part of the seasonal Parisian fairs, especially the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent. They included farces, tightrope acts, acrobatics, and marionettes, and also included music, such as ''[[Vaudeville (song)|vaudevilles]]'' and popular songs. The audiences were diverse, from all levels of society, and the presentations were given on makeshift stages. However, with the establishment in 1672 of [[King Louis XIV]]'s [[Acad\u00e9mie royale de Musique]] (popularly known as the Op\u00e9ra) under [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], the use of music by fair troupes was significantly curtailed.<ref name=HW858to60>Harris-Warrick 1992, pp. 858&ndash;860.</ref><ref name=Pitou24to25>Pitou 1983, vol. 1, pp. 24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Com\u00e9die-Italienne|Italian players]] at the [[H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (theatre)|H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne]] were banished from Paris in 1697 for performing their comedy ''La fausse prude'' (\"The False Prude\"), which satirized the King's mistress, [[Madame de Maintenon]], the fair theatres were quick to adopt much of the Italians' repertory, which included parodies of operas and tragedies. The fair theatres were soon viewed as competition by the Op\u00e9ra and the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and restrictions were again more strictly enforced. The troupes at the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent received warnings from the police in 1699 and 1706. Although in 1708 the fairground entrepreneurs Charles Alard and Maurice were able to purchase from the Op\u00e9ra's director [[Pierre Guyenet]] the right to use singers, dancers, musicians, and sets, this did not last as Guyenet died in 1712, leaving the Op\u00e9ra with a debt in the neighborhood of 400,000 livres. Alard resorted to giving silent performances with the actors' speeches displayed to the audience on large cue cards. The players next tried including vaudeville airs via audience participation: the musicians would play a popular tune, and the spectators would sing, while the actors remained silent. This was further enhanced when the words began to be displayed to the audience on a large banner.<ref name=HW858to60/><ref name=Pitou24to25/><ref name=Johnson>Johnson 2008, p. 162&ndash;163.</ref><ref>Wild 1992, p. 586.</ref>\n\n==Foundation and early history==\n[[File:Favart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|<center>Favart</center>]]\nIn 1713 and 1714 several of the fair troupes were able to conclude a new series of agreements with the creditors of the deceased Guyenet, who at this point had become the managers of the rather expensive Op\u00e9ra. For an annual fee the troupes obtained the right to perform light comedies interspersed with songs and dances and to use sets and theatre machines.<ref name=Johnson/> They were also given the right to use the name \"Op\u00e9ra-Comique\". The first work officially given that designation was ''T\u00e9l\u00e9maque'' (a parody of the opera by [[Andr\u00e9 Cardinal Destouches]]), which was first performed by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire#Foire Saint-Germain|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Foire Saint-Germain]] in 1715. The words were by [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage]], the music was arranged by Jean-Claude Gillier, and the orchestra consisted of 15 players. Lesage authored many of the early ''op\u00e9ras comiques'', and composers like Gillier worked primarily as arrangers of existing music.<ref name=HW858to60/><ref name=WW1996>Warrack and West 1996, p. 376.

[[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] may also have been the leader of the orchestra. The company was, however, too successful, and the Op\u00e9ra refused to renew Monnet's privilege in 1745. After working briefly in Lyon, and mounting unsuccessful productions in Dijon (1746) and London (1749), he was able to repurchase the Op\u00e9ra-Comique ''privil\u00e8ge'' in December 1751 and remained its director until 1757.<ref name=Cook>Cook 1992, p. 436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Le diable \u00e0 quatre - Michel Sedaine - NGO3-863.jpg|thumb|A scene from ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'' with text by Michel-Jean Sedaine]]\nDuring his second period as director, Monnet continued to work with Favart and Noverre, and Boucher designed and built a substantial new theatre for the company of the Foire Saint-Laurent in 1752. The theatre was later installed in a wing of the [[Salle des Menus-Plaisirs (rue Berg\u00e8re)|H\u00f4tel des Menus-Plaisirs]] on the rue Berg\u00e8re, where it was used by the Op\u00e9ra in 1781,<ref>Gourret 1985, pp. 81\u201384</ref> and then as the first concert hall of the [[Paris Conservatory]], which was founded on the same site in 1795.<ref>Simeone 2000, p. 214.</ref>  The new theatre was especially important, as it enabled the company to perform at times when the fair was not in operation. Monnet's friend [[Jean-Joseph Vad\u00e9]] wrote the libretto for ''[[Les troqueurs]]'', first staged in July 1753 and advertised as a translation of an Italian work. The music was actually original, composed by [[Antoine Dauvergne]], and began a period of new works in a more Italian style in which music played a much more significant role. Composers for the company during this period included [[Egidio Duni]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor]] and [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny]].<ref name=HW863/><ref name=Cook/>\n\nThe dramatist [[Michel-Jean Sedaine]] wrote the text of his first opera for the company, ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'',  in 1756. It premiered at the Fair Saint-Laurent on 19 August with verses for the ''ariettes'' provided by Pierre Baurans and with music parodying a variety of composers including [[Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi]], Duni, [[Baldassare Galuppi]], and [[Giuseppe Scarlatti]], and also included music attributed to the French composers Jean-Louis Laurette and Philidor. [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was later to compose his own music for the work. [[Le diable \u00e0 quatre (opera)|His version]] was first given in Laxenburg, Austria, on 28 May 1759. Other settings were later composed for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique by [[Bernardo Porta]] (14 February 1790)<ref>The music and libretto for Bernardo Porta's version of ''Le diable \u00e0 quatre'' have not been found.</ref> and [[Jean-Pierre Soli\u00e9]] (30 November 1809).<ref>Wild and Charlton 2005, p. 221.</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|1762}}1762 to 1807==\n[[File:Salle Favart I - Pugin & Heath 1829 after p24 - IA (adjusted).jpg|thumb|The first ''Salle Favart'' which housed the company between 1783 and 1801]]\n\nOn 3 February 1762 the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was merged into the [[Com\u00e9die-Italienne]] and occupied the [[H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (theatre)|H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne]],<ref>Charlton 1986, p. 6.</ref> gaining in respectability what it lost in independence. The company was renamed to Op\u00e9ra-Comique by an edict of the king in 1780, although the names Com\u00e9die-Italienne and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien were still used frequently by the press and public for many years thereafter. In 1783 the company moved again, into the Salle Favart (architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Heurtier; ca. 1,100 seats) on the site where the current theatre stands. Around that time the works of [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try|Gr\u00e9try]] featured strongly.<ref name=HW863/><ref>Opera-Comique website: Historique, accessed 3 April 2009.</ref>\n\nWith the proliferation of opera houses after the Law of 1791 which removed restrictions on the opening of theatres, there was competition with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau]], which was resolved in 1801 by merger. By 1807 Napoleon had reduced theatrical freedoms, and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was named one of four primary theatres in Paris.\n\n==The 19th century==\n[[File:Salle Favart Fire 1887 NGOp878.jpg|thumb|Fire at the second ''Salle Favart'' on {{nowrap|25 May 1887}} (engraving).]]\n\nFrench ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]'', in the 19th century at least, was not necessarily comic; the term covered a much wider category of work. Notable composers in the history of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique  include [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy|Hal\u00e9vy]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]. After Rossini's arrival in Paris, new works at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique took in italian vocal style and techniques, leading to greater virtuosity, although \"the repertory as a whole stood as a bulwark against the italianate invasion of Rossini\".<ref>David Charlton. Paris \u00a74 (iii) The Op\u00e9ra-Comique. In: [[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]], (Ed.) Sadie S., London & New York: Macmillan, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn 1840, the Op\u00e9ra-Comique company settled in the second Salle Favart (architect Louis Charpentier; 1,500 seats), built on the site of the first theatre, destroyed by fire in 1838. The new house was inaugurated with a revival of H\u00e9rold's ''[[Le Pr\u00e9 aux clercs]]''. During the 1850s and 1860s the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] offered competition in the type of repertoire staged, being particularly strong in its policy of new commissions.\n\nPerformances took place on most evenings of the week except for major festivals. Boxes could be hired for a year at a time, and many subscribers were wealthy. Before 1848 a third of subscribers were of the aristocracy, but after then it became an especially middle class theatre. After 1848 [[\u00c9mile Perrin]] sought to revive the repertoire with more literary and ambitious works. Until 1864 its repertoire was still prescribed, by statute, to have spoken dialogue between musical numbers.<ref name=HW1992>Harris-Warrick 1992.</ref>\n\nThe Op\u00e9ra-Comique staged the first performances of such important French works as Berlioz's ''[[The Damnation of Faust]]'' (1846), Thomas' ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' (1875). In the latter part of the century the theatre revived works it had made its own, restaged works from the repertoire of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique (which had closed in 1872) and premiered new pieces, such as Offenbach's ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]'' (1881); Delibes' ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'' (1883); Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'' (1884), ''[[Esclarmonde]]'' (1889), and ''[[Werther]]'' (French premiere in 1893); and Charpentier's ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' (1900).\n\nA fire at the Salle Favart on 25 May 1887 resulted in the death of 84 people by asphyxiation. The building was destroyed and the director [[L\u00e9on Carvalho]] was forced to resign, although later he was acquitted of blame and resumed the helm at the company from 1891 to 1897. The third Salle Favart (architect [[Louis Bernier]]) was officially opened in the presence of President [[F\u00e9lix Faure]] on 7 December 1898.\n\n==The 20th century and beyond==\nAs the differences between op\u00e9ra and op\u00e9ra comique faded, the two main houses in Paris came more into competition, although the Salle Favart saw the premieres of more innovative works: Debussy's ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' (1902), Dukas' ''[[Ariane et Barbe-bleue]]'' (1907), Ravel's ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'' (1911), and French premieres of works by Puccini and Falla. Between 1900 and 1950, 401 works by 206 different composers were performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, of which 222 were either world premieres (136) or the first performance in Paris (86).<ref name=Wolff/>\n\nIn June 1936 a broadcast of ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann'' was disrupted by the start of a company sit-in demanding the director's resignation.<ref>Nichols R.

Although its budget amounted to less than most provincial French opera houses, the first new director of the independent Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Thierry Fouquet, attempted to run a balanced programme but handed over in 1994 to Pierre M\u00e9decin, who was responsible for the centenary season in 1998 with a new production of ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande''. The loss of private sponsors led to a policy of musical comedy and operetta under J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary from 2000.<ref name=\"deSP\"/> A decree of November 2004 put the theatre on a new basis, stressing the variety of productions it should mount: \"de l'op\u00e9ra baroque \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine et le patrimoine de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique\".<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005874657&dateTexte=vig D\u00e9cret n\u00b02004-1232 du 20 novembre 2004 fixant le statut du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique]</ref>\n\nIt currently mounts 7 or 8 operas or op\u00e9ra comiques (some of them co-productions), with complementary concerts, recitals and exhibitions, each season.
