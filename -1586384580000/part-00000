Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}.

Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u2ca7\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u03ef\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>).\n* ''\u1e6d\u016bbah'' {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0648\u0628\u0629}} \"brick\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014d\u014dbe}}; Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014dbi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].\n* ''w\u0101\u1e25ah'' {{lang|ar|\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629}} \"oasis\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u03e9\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouahe}}, Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c89\u03e9\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouehi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}\n\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|baare}}, \"small boat\".\n\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{cite report | author = <!-- or |last= and |first= --> | authorlink = | authors = | date = September 2006 | title = Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] | url = http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf | publisher = KONDA | format = PDF | others = | edition = | location = | chapter = Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue] | page = 19 | pages = | docket = | quote = }}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{cite book | last= Sijpesteijn | first= Petra |author2=Lennart Sundelin | title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | year=2004 | location=Leiden, Boston | isbn=978-90-04-13886-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward.

It's possible there was also a distinction between short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but if so the functional load was extremely low.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Sahidic stressed vowels\n!\n!

It's difficult to explain <\u03b7>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.\n\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are,\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Sahidic stressed vowels\n|\u03b1||\u03b1\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03bf||\u03c9||\u03c9\u03c9\n|-\n!Mesokemic equivalent\n|\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03b7||\u03b1||\u03bf||\u03c9\n|}\n\nIt's not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they're an imitation of the long Greek vowels <\u03b7, \u03c9>.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAs with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big>. <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> is transcribed as {{angle bracket|j}} in many older Coptic sources and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> as {{angle bracket|\u0261}}{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} or {{angle bracket|\u010d}}. {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}} notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[t\u02b2]}} and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[k\u02b2]}}. {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004|p=22}} suggests that <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}.\n\nThe following chart shows the consonants that are represented in Sahidic Coptic orthography.

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Proclitic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |As suffix\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n!

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}\n\n'''Absolute state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93 \u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijimi \u0259mpai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jimi \u0259m-p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Nominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99 \u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijem pai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=NOM:nominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jem p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Pronominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big> - ''Aij\u0259ntf''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=PRONOM:pronominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big>\n|a-i-j\u0259nt{{=}}f\n|PFV-1SG-find.PRONOM{{=}}3MSG\n|'I found him.'}}\n\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject. The future I {{IPA|/na/}} is a preverbal particle and follows the subject:{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=210}}\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5 \u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''Pecoeis nakrine \u0259nnelaos''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|Pe-coeis '''na'''-krine \u0259n-ne-laos\n|DEF:MASC:SG-lord FUT-judge PREP-DEF:PL-people\n|'The lord will judge the nations.'}}\n\nIn contrast, the perfective {{IPA|/a/}} is a pre-subject particle:\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80 \u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c87\u2c89 \u2c9f\u2c97 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''A tefs\u014dne de ol \u0259nnefk\u0113s''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c87\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2c97}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|'''A''' te-f-s\u014dne de ol \u0259n-ne-f-k\u0113s\n|PFV DEF:F:SG-3MSG-sister {{gcl|PART|particle}} carry.ABS PREP-DEF:PL-3MSG-bone\n|'His sister carried his bones.'}}\n\nThere is some variation in the labels for the tense/aspect/mood categories.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{cite journal|last=Abel|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Abel|title=On the Coptic Language|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61|year=1855|issue=5|ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".

Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. It was supplanted by [[Egyptian Arabic]] as a [[spoken language]] toward the [[early modern period]], but [[language revitalisation]] efforts have been underway since the 19th century.\n\n== Name ==\nThe native Coptic name for the language is <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u2c99\u2c89\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259-met-\u027eem-\u0259n-k\u02b0e\u02d0.m\u0259/}} in the Bohairic (Delta) dialect and <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c9b\u0304\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2c99\u0304\u2c9b\u0304\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/t(\u0259)-m\u0259nt-\u027e\u0259m-\u0259n-ke\u02d0.m\u0259/}} in the Sahidic (Valley) dialect. The particle prefix ''me(n)t-'' from the verb <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u03ef}}</big> ''moudi'' ('to speak') forms many abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to \"language\"). The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

Thus, the whole expression literally means 'language of the people of Egypt', or simply 'Egyptian language'.\n\nAnother name by which the language has been called is <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c9b\u0304\u2ca7\u2c95\u2ca9\u2ca1\u2ca7\u2c81\u2c93\u2c9f\u2c9b}}</big> ''/t\u0259m\u0259ntkuptaion/'' from the Copto-[[Greek language|Greek]] form <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c9b\u0304\u2ca7\u2c81\u2c93\u2c85\u2ca9\u2ca1\u2ca7\u2c93\u2c9f\u2c9b}}</big> ''/t\u0259m\u0259ntaigupton/'' ('Egyptian language'). The term ''logos \u0259n aiguptios'' ('Egyptian language') is also attested in Sahidic, but ''logos'' and ''aiguptios'' are both Greek in origin. In the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the name is more officially <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u2c81\u2ca5\u2ca1\u2c93 \u2c9b\u0300\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''tiaspi \u0259nrem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi'', 'the Egyptian language', <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2ca5\u2ca1\u2c93}}</big> ''aspi'' being the Egyptian word for language.\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n{{IPA notice}}\nCoptic is today spoken liturgically in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Catholic Church]] (along with [[Modern Standard Arabic]]). The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}. Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> is grammatically masculine and hence would have been vocalised ''pemsah'' or ''bemsah'' (Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>). Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u2ca7\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u03ef\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>).\n* ''\u1e6d\u016bbah'' {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0648\u0628\u0629}} \"brick\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014d\u014dbe}}; Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014dbi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].\n* ''w\u0101\u1e25ah'' {{lang|ar|\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629}} \"oasis\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u03e9\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouahe}}, Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c89\u03e9\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouehi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}\n\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|baare}}, \"small boat\".\n\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

However, Coptic [[reborrowing|reborrowed]] some words of Ancient Egyptian origin into its lexicon, via Greek.

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and astrological papyri. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{cite report | author = <!-- or |last= and |first= --> | authorlink = | authors = | date = September 2006 | title = Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] | url = http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf | publisher = KONDA | format = PDF | others = | edition = | location = | chapter = Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue] | page = 19 | pages = | docket = | quote = }}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{cite book | last= Sijpesteijn | first= Petra |author2=Lennart Sundelin | title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | year=2004 | location=Leiden, Boston | isbn=978-90-04-13886-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward. (Another common interpretation is that these represented glottal stop.)\n\nAkhmimic is conservative, close to what is reconstructed for Old Coptic.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Akhmimic stressed vowels\n!\n!

It's difficult to explain <\u03b7>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.\n\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic.

A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Late Coptic consonants\n|-\n!

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Proclitic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |As suffix\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n!

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb.

However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{cite journal|last=Abel|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Abel|title=On the Coptic Language|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61|year=1855|issue=5|ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".

He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.<ref name=mommsen/>\n\nFrom his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.<ref name=mommsen/> He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through the progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.\n\nPetrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: \"My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms.

They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Popes ruling as kings, worship of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.<ref>F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.</ref>\n\n===Baronius=== \nIn response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.<ref>[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001).

Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906).

It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number including the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a specific recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age,' in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers,\" between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to increase in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a shortage of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages', which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry.\" <ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them, the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith,\" was, therefore, the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World,\" in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them, the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion. At the same time [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages.\" <ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age,\" was criticizing the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to regret what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages,' used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The most first recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century, it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a fashion for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith.\" This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice, K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was mainly the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\n19th-century historians widely used the term. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of \"the lively centuries which we call dark.\" <!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--><ref>[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''.

It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.\"</ref>\n\nMost modern historians do not use the term \"dark ages,\" preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].

Further south and east, the same was true in the former Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced it's [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term neutrally: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.<ref name=mommsen/>\n\nFrom his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.<ref name=mommsen/> He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through the progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.\n\nPetrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: \"My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever.

They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Popes ruling as kings, worship of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.<ref>F.

Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906).

It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number including the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a specific recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age,' in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers,\" between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to increase in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a shortage of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages', which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry.\" <ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them, the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith,\" was, therefore, the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World,\" in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them, the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion. At the same time [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages.\" <ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age,\" was criticizing the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to regret what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages,' used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The most first recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century, it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a fashion for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith.\" This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice, K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was mainly the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\n19th-century historians widely used the term. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of \"the lively centuries which we call dark.\" <!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--><ref>[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.</ref> More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes \"the dark ages\" as \"a popular if ignorant manner of speaking.\" <ref>Dunphy, Graeme (2007). \"Literary Transitions, 1300\u20131500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern\" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: \"Early Modern German Literature.\"  The chapter opens: \"A popular if an uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as \"the dark ages.\" If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Bl\u00fctezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.\"</ref>\n\nMost modern historians do not use the term \"dark ages,\" preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].

Further south and east, the same was true in the former Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced it's [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term neutrally: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

An ancient tradition without historical confirmation states that the diocese began in the first half of the 2nd century and that its first bishop was a Saint Eustace. According to ''Praedestinatus'', a work by an unknown author in southern Gaul around the mid 5th century, the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Valentinus' disciple Heracleon began preaching in Sicily, but was firmly opposed by Eustace bishop of Lilybaeum and Theodore bishop of Palermo, who both denounced him to [[Pope Alexander I]] (105-115). The second traditional bishop was the martyr Gregorius or Gregory, living between the 3rd and 4th centuries but only recorded in the life of the 7th-8th century Saint Gregorius, bishop of Girgenti.\n\nThe first historically-confirmed Bishop of Lilybaeum was the mathematician and astronomer Pascasinus, captured and taken to Africa by the [[Vandals]]. After his return to Sicily he wrote a letter to [[Pope Leo I]] in 442\u2013443, mentioning an event in the diocese in 417, meaning it had definitely been founded by that date. Leo I sent Pascasinus a letter via the other Sicilian bishops in 447.

One of these letters mentions that Adeodata, a woman from a patrician family, had founded a nunnery dedicated to the martyr saints Peter, Laurence, Hermes, Pancras, Sebastian and Agnes in her house in Lilybaeum. At that time Sicily was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and - as emerges in the letters - Sicily's dioceses reported directly to Rome rather than having a metropolitan bishop.

Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the [[Australian Plate|Australian continental plate]] with other islands in the Pacific into one \"quasi-continent\" called [[Oceania]].

Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as \"''more or less'' discrete masses of land\".{{sfnp|Lewis & Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=35}} Asia and Africa are joined by the [[Isthmus of Suez]], and North and South America by the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]], which are both narrow and shallow, as well as artificial). Both these [[isthmus]]es are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.\n\nNorth America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the [[Americas]]. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.<ref>{{harvp|Lewis & Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |loc=Chapter 1 |ps=: \"While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. [...] By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations.\"}}</ref> This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Germany, Greece and Hungary, where they are taught as a single continent.\n\nThe criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of {{convert|10180000|sqkm}}, while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view\u2014in geology and geography\u2014that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of [[Eurocentrism]]: \"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, [[China]] and [[India]] are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\"{{sfnp|Lewis & Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=? }} However, for historical and cultural reasons, the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.\n\nIf continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref name=\"McColl\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=continents|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Geography|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&pg=PA215|editor=R.W.

At those times [[Australia (continent)|Australia\u2013New Guinea]] was a single, continuous continent. Likewise, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]].

The craton itself is an [[accretion (geology)|accretionary]] complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of [[subduction]], [[continental collision]] and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed [[sedimentary rock]] covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or [[river delta|deltaic]] [[sediment]]s. Beyond the margin, there is either a [[continental shelf]] and drop off to the [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are \"high and dry\"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|last = Kominz|first = Michelle A.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2001|location = San Diego|pages = 2609|chapter = Sea level variations over geologic time|chapter-url = http://www.curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter10/Ency_Oceans/Sea_Level_Variations.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans]]\n\nSome argue that continents are accretionary crustal \"rafts\" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. [[East European craton]] and [[Indian craton]]). Younger mobile belts (such as the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Himalayas]]) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.\n\nThere are many [[Continental fragment|microcontinents, or continental fragments]], that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]],<ref name=\"Mortimer_et_al_2017\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm | title=Zealandia: Earth\u2019s Hidden Continent | first1=N. | last1=Mortimer | first2=H.J. | last2=Campbell | first3=A.J. | last3=Tulloch | first4=P.R. | last4=King | first5=V.M. | last5=Stagpoole | first6=R.A. | last6=Wood | first7=M.S. | last7=Rattenbury | first8=R. | last8=Sutherland | first9=C.J. | last9=Adams | first10=J. | last10=Collot | first11=M. | last11=Seton | journal=GSA Today | year=2017 | volume=27 | issue=3 | pages=27\u201335 | doi=10.1130/GSATG321A.1}}</ref> which includes [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]; [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]].

The [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] are margins of the [[Laurasia]]n continent\u2014only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.\n\n[[Plate tectonics]] offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified [[Eurasian Plate]], which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent [[Himalaya]] mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting [[isthmus]] being largely the result of [[volcano|volcanism]] from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the [[Canadian Shield]]), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (\"continental rocks,\" \"plate boundaries\") are used as appropriate.\n\nThe movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents.

Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as \"''more or less'' discrete masses of land\".{{sfnp|Lewis & Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=35}} Asia and Africa are joined by the [[Isthmus of Suez]], and North and South America by the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]], which are both narrow and shallow, as well as artificial). Both these [[isthmus]]es are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.\n\nNorth America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the [[Americas]]. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.<ref>{{harvp|Lewis & Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |loc=Chapter 1 |ps=: \"While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II.

Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of {{convert|10180000|sqkm}}, while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view\u2014in geology and geography\u2014that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world.

In the mid-17th century, [[Peter Heylin]] wrote in his ''Cosmographie'' that \"A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.\" In 1727, [[Ephraim Chambers]] wrote in his ''Cyclop\u00e6dia,'' \"The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the [[Old World|old]] and the [[New World|new]].\" And in his 1752 atlas, [[Emanuel Bowen]] defined a continent as \"a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.\"<ref>Bowen, Emanuel. (1752). ''A Complete Atlas, or Distinct View of the Known World''.

In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock]], largely of [[granite|granitic]] composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable [[Precambrian]] \"shield\", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a [[craton]]. The craton itself is an [[accretion (geology)|accretionary]] complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of [[subduction]], [[continental collision]] and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed [[sedimentary rock]] covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or [[river delta|deltaic]] [[sediment]]s. Beyond the margin, there is either a [[continental shelf]] and drop off to the [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are \"high and dry\"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|last = Kominz|first = Michelle A.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2001|location = San Diego|pages = 2609|chapter = Sea level variations over geologic time|chapter-url = http://www.curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter10/Ency_Oceans/Sea_Level_Variations.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans]]\n\nSome argue that continents are accretionary crustal \"rafts\" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. [[East European craton]] and [[Indian craton]]). Younger mobile belts (such as the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Himalayas]]) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.\n\nThere are many [[Continental fragment|microcontinents, or continental fragments]], that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]],<ref name=\"Mortimer_et_al_2017\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm | title=Zealandia: Earth\u2019s Hidden Continent | first1=N. | last1=Mortimer | first2=H.J. | last2=Campbell | first3=A.J. | last3=Tulloch | first4=P.R. | last4=King | first5=V.M. | last5=Stagpoole | first6=R.A. | last6=Wood | first7=M.S. | last7=Rattenbury | first8=R. | last8=Sutherland | first9=C.J. | last9=Adams | first10=J. | last10=Collot | first11=M. | last11=Seton | journal=GSA Today | year=2017 | volume=27 | issue=3 | pages=27\u201335 | doi=10.1130/GSATG321A.1}}</ref> which includes [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]; [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]].

The [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] are margins of the [[Laurasia]]n continent\u2014only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.\n\n[[Plate tectonics]] offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified [[Eurasian Plate]], which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent [[Himalaya]] mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting [[isthmus]] being largely the result of [[volcano|volcanism]] from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the [[Canadian Shield]]), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (\"continental rocks,\" \"plate boundaries\") are used as appropriate.\n\nThe movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents.
