This was in reference to one of the episodes aired in the month of May where one of the female characters named Roja hires a criminal gang to sexually assault her own sister. She ordered the men to show no mercy on her during this preplanned assault. The gang instead of following through the plan, enact the same plan on Roja. The controversial episodes were telecast on May 14, 15 and June 28.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/250919/director-says-sorry-for-sexual-assault-scenes-in-tv-soap.html|title=Director says sorry for sexual assault scenes in TV soap|last=|first=|date=|website=Deccan Chronicle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nThe council, on examining the video clips based on the complaints, has said in their order that the content violated the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) guidelines which bars content that glorifies violence, as well as incite or encourage viewers to obscene or indecent behaviour. A notice was issued to the channel and in their reply to the council, Sun TV and Thiru Pictures had clarified and apologised to the Council.

She ordered the men to show no mercy on her during this preplanned assault. The gang instead of following through the plan, enact the same plan on Roja. The controversial episodes were telecast on May 14, 15 and June 28.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/250919/director-says-sorry-for-sexual-assault-scenes-in-tv-soap.html|title=Director says sorry for sexual assault scenes in TV soap|last=|first=|date=|website=Deccan Chronicle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nThe council, on examining the video clips based on the complaints, has said in their order that the content violated the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) guidelines which bars content that glorifies violence, as well as incite or encourage viewers to obscene or indecent behaviour.

Oh, no, not a new magazine, it is vol. 30, number 4; it was ''Modern Mechanics'' recently, and back of that &mdash; but let it tell its own story of absorptions, marriages, serial-cannibalism or whatever you may call its checkered life hitherto. The ''World's Advance'', formerly ''Modern Mechanics'', with which is combined ''Popular Electricity'' and ''The World's Advance'', ''Modern Electrics and Mechanics'', ''Electrician and Mechanic'', is the outgrowth of a number of consolidated magazines. First was ''Popular Electrician'' founded in Lynn, Mass., in 1890, taken over later by ''Electrician and Mechanic'', Boston. This absorbed ''Amateur Work'', and ''Building Craft'' and in January 1914, was itself merged in ''Modern Electrics'' of New York, and called ''Modern Electrics and Mechanics''. Then ''Popular Electricity'' and the ''World's Advance'' of Chicago was combined with it under the name of ''Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics''. This name being too long ''Modern Mechanics'' was decided upon for the new name, but this being found liable to confusion with a similar periodical [called ''Popular Mechanics''], the name ''World's Advance'' was adopted.\" Some pedigree! But it's now a capital magazine for those of a mechanical turn of mind, and is profusely illustrated. </blockquote>\n\n''World's Advance'' had a readership of 135,000 \"men\" by 1915.

A typical size magazine would be bound into volumes every six months, magazine publishers would normally change titles or merge magazines on these volume boundaries.

The ''World's Advance'', formerly ''Modern Mechanics'', with which is combined ''Popular Electricity'' and ''The World's Advance'', ''Modern Electrics and Mechanics'', ''Electrician and Mechanic'', is the outgrowth of a number of consolidated magazines. First was ''Popular Electrician'' founded in Lynn, Mass., in 1890, taken over later by ''Electrician and Mechanic'', Boston. This absorbed ''Amateur Work'', and ''Building Craft'' and in January 1914, was itself merged in ''Modern Electrics'' of New York, and called ''Modern Electrics and Mechanics''. Then ''Popular Electricity'' and the ''World's Advance'' of Chicago was combined with it under the name of ''Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics''. This name being too long ''Modern Mechanics'' was decided upon for the new name, but this being found liable to confusion with a similar periodical [called ''Popular Mechanics''], the name ''World's Advance'' was adopted.\" Some pedigree! But it's now a capital magazine for those of a mechanical turn of mind, and is profusely illustrated. </blockquote>\n\n''World's Advance'' had a readership of 135,000 \"men\" by 1915.

However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli.\" From The Aeronautics File By Max Feil\n</ref>\n* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere.

The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances.

The functional principle of a microwave oven is [[dielectric heating]] rather than resonance frequencies of water, and microwave ovens can therefore operate at many frequencies. Water molecules are exposed to intense electromagnetic fields in strong non-resonant microwaves to create heat. The 22&nbsp;GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths. The typical oven frequency of [[ISM band|2.45&nbsp;GHz]] was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size, and partly to avoid interference with communication frequencies in use when microwave ovens became commercially available.<ref name=\"microwave\">{{cite web |author=Bloomfield, Louis |url=http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |title=Question 1456 |publisher=How Everything Works |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017005928/http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* [[Microwave oven]]s do not cook food from the inside out. 2.45&nbsp;GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods.

Also, while Bernoulli's principle allows us to compare fluid speeds and pressures along a single streamline and... along two different streamlines that originate under identical fluid conditions, using Bernoulli's principle to compare the air above and below the curved paper in Figure 1 is nonsensical; in this case, there aren't any streamlines at all below the paper!\" Peter Eastwell ''Bernoulli?

The upper edge is a complicated vortex-laden mixing layer and the distant flow is quiescent, so that Bernoulli's law is hardly applicable.\" David Auerbach ''Why Aircreft Fly'' European Journal of Physics Vol 21 p 289 http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/21/4/302/pdf/0143-0807_21_4_302.pdf\n* \"Millions of children in science classes are being asked to blow over curved pieces of paper and observe that the paper \"lifts\"...

Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli.\" From The Aeronautics File By Max Feil\n</ref>\n* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere. The common myth often refers to the draining action of [[flush toilets]] and [[bathtubs]]. Rotation is determined by whatever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain. The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied [[torque]]s (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.\n* [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Gyroscopic effects|Gyroscopic forces]] or [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|geometric trail]] are not required for a rider to [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Other hypotheses|balance]] a bicycle or for it to demonstrate [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Self-stability|self-stability]].<ref name=\"KMPRS\">{{cite journal\n| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | author = J.

She first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 21)|series twenty-one]] episode \"China Crisis\", broadcast on 8 January 2019. Ange arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a consultant general surgeon on the Young Adult Unit (YAU), a ward she helps to create. Steele was cast in the role following a meeting with the show's production team. She was \"delighted\" to join the show's cast and it was soon publicised that Ange would have a number of \"explosive\" secrets, which would then drive ''Holby City'' stories forward. Ange is characterised as \"ballsy\", \"tenacious\" and \"stubborn\". Steele has stated that Ange is portrayed as the most emotional surgeon imaginable. Her empathy for patients is often displayed in scenes, which Steele believed was a result of Ange's past experiences.\n\nAnge was introduced into the series alongside returning character [[Tom Campbell-Gore]] ([[Denis Lawson]]). At the helm of the new YAU ward, writers gave Ange a pivotal role in a [[right to life]] story. It focused on the patient Holly Cartwright (Emma Curtis), who is declared brain dead and being aided by a life support system. Ange assists the patient's family but also advocates for the hospital's right to remove life support. The topical story also drew comparison to real life cases. Her secrets soon became the focus of her storylines. First came the revelation that her colleague, [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]), is her biological son that she had previously given up for adoption. Steele later revealed that she felt the story was divisive amongst viewers because of the emotional drama it caused Dominic. Then her daughter, [[Chloe Godard]] ([[Amy Lennox]]) was introduced and writers explored their backstory detailing that Chloe was conceived after Ange was raped. \n\nOther stories for the character have focused on her feud with Chloe's manipulative boyfriend Evan Crowhurst ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]) and a relationship with [[Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher]] ([[Alex Walkinshaw]]). The character was received positively due to Steele's acting abilities. David Brown writing for the ''[[Radio Times]]'' praised Steele's portrayal during the right to life story. Sue Haasler of the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' complimented her performance during the adoption secret revelation and Bill Gibbs from ''The Sunday Post'' said Steele \"relished\" the role. \n\n==Casting==\nOn 19 September 2018, it was announced that actress [[Dawn Steele]] was cast in the role of Ange.<ref name=casting>{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=Jonathon |title=Holby City casts Monarch of the Glenn star \u2013 and confirms Zosia return |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-09-19/holby-city-casts-monarch-of-the-glenn-star-and-confirms-zosia-return/ |website=[[Radio Times]] |publisher=([[Immediate Media Company]]) |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> Steele spent more than two years commuting to [[Glasgow]] while appearing in follow BBC production, ''[[River City]]''.

She first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 21)|series twenty-one]] episode \"China Crisis\", broadcast on 8 January 2019. Ange arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a consultant general surgeon on the Young Adult Unit (YAU), a ward she helps to create. Steele was cast in the role following a meeting with the show's production team. She was \"delighted\" to join the show's cast and it was soon publicised that Ange would have a number of \"explosive\" secrets, which would then drive ''Holby City'' stories forward. Ange is characterised as \"ballsy\", \"tenacious\" and \"stubborn\". Steele has stated that Ange is portrayed as the most emotional surgeon imaginable. Her empathy for patients is often displayed in scenes, which Steele believed was a result of Ange's past experiences.\n\nAnge was introduced into the series alongside returning character [[Tom Campbell-Gore]] ([[Denis Lawson]]). At the helm of the new YAU ward, writers gave Ange a pivotal role in a [[right to life]] story. It focused on the patient Holly Cartwright (Emma Curtis), who is declared brain dead and being aided by a life support system. Ange assists the patient's family but also advocates for the hospital's right to remove life support. The topical story also drew comparison to real life cases. Her secrets soon became the focus of her storylines. First came the revelation that her colleague, [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]), is her biological son that she had previously given up for adoption. Steele later revealed that she felt the story was divisive amongst viewers because of the emotional drama it caused Dominic. Then her daughter, [[Chloe Godard]] ([[Amy Lennox]]) was introduced and writers explored their backstory detailing that Chloe was conceived after Ange was raped. \n\nOther stories for the character have focused on her feud with Chloe's manipulative boyfriend Evan Crowhurst ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]) and a relationship with [[Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher]] ([[Alex Walkinshaw]]). The character was received positively due to Steele's acting abilities. David Brown writing for the ''[[Radio Times]]'' praised Steele's portrayal during the right to life story. Sue Haasler of the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' complimented her performance during the adoption secret revelation and Bill Gibbs from ''The Sunday Post'' said Steele \"relished\" the role. \n\n==Casting==\nOn 19 September 2018, it was announced that actress [[Dawn Steele]] was cast in the role of Ange.<ref name=casting>{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=Jonathon |title=Holby City casts Monarch of the Glenn star \u2013 and confirms Zosia return |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-09-19/holby-city-casts-monarch-of-the-glenn-star-and-confirms-zosia-return/ |website=[[Radio Times]] |publisher=([[Immediate Media Company]]) |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> Steele spent more than two years commuting to [[Glasgow]] while appearing in follow BBC production, ''[[River City]]''.

It was very successful in that period, due to its low price (due to the inexpensive 6502) and easy-access expandability.\n\n[[Image:Kim-1-computer.jpg|thumb|right|KIM-1 computer in operation]]\n\n== History ==\nMOS Technology's first processor, the [[MOS Technology 6501|6501]], could be plugged into existing motherboards that used the [[Motorola 6800]], allowing potential users (i.e. engineers and hobbyists) to get a development system up and running very easily using existing hardware. [[Motorola]] immediately sued, forcing MOS to pull the 6501 from the market.  Changing the pin layout produced the \"lawsuit-friendly\" [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]. Otherwise identical to the 6501, it nevertheless had the disadvantage of having no machine in which new users could quickly start playing with the [[central processing unit|CPU]].\n\n[[Chuck Peddle]], leader of the 650x group at MOS (and former member of Motorola's 6800 team), designed the KIM-1 in order to fill this need. The KIM-1 came to market in 1976. While the machine was originally intended to be used by engineers, it quickly found a large audience with  hobbyists. A complete system could be constructed for under {{nowrap|500 US$}} with the purchase of the kit for only {{nowrap|245 US$}}, and then adding a power supply, a used [[Character-oriented terminal|terminal]] and a [[Kansas City standard|cassette tape drive]].\n\nMany books were available demonstrating small [[assembly language]] programs for the KIM, including ''The First Book of KIM'' by  [[Jim Butterfield]] ''et al''.<ref name=\"Butterfield, KIM, First Book of\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Butterfield  |first=Jim  |authorlink=Jim Butterfield\n  |year=1977\n  |url=https://archive.org/stream/The_First_Book_of_KIM#page/n0/mode/2up\n  |title=The First Book of KIM\n  |first2=Stan  |last2=Ockers  |first3=Eric  |last3=Rehnke\n  |isbn=0-8104-5119-0\n  |publisher=Hayden Book\n  |ref=Butterfield, KIM, First Book of\n}}</ref> One demo program converted the KIM into a music box by toggling a software-controllable output bit connected to a small [[loudspeaker]].  Canadian programmer [[Peter R. Jennings]] produced what was probably the first game for microcomputers to be sold commercially, ''[[Microchess]],'' originally for the KIM-1.\n\nAs the system became more popular one of the common additions was the [[Tiny BASIC|Tiny BASIC programming language]].\nThis required an easy memory expansion; \"all of the decoding for the first 4 K is provided right on the KIM board. All you need to provide is 4 K more of RAM chips and some buffers.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Simpson\n  | first = Richard\n  | title = A Date with KIM\n  | url = https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-05/1976_05_BYTE_00-09_Shooting_Stars#page/n9/mode/2up\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 9\n  | pages = 14\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = May 1976\n}}</ref> The hard part was loading the BASIC from [[cassette tape]]\u2014a 15-minute, error-prone ordeal.\n\n[[Rockwell International]]\u2014who second-sourced the 6502, along with [[Synertek]]\u2014released their own microcomputer in one board in 1978, the [[AIM 65]].  The AIM included a full [[ASCII]] keyboard, a 20-character [[fourteen segment display|14-segment]] [[alphanumeric]] [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and a small [[cash register]]-like printer.  A [[debugger|debug]] [[machine code monitor|monitor]] was provided as standard [[firmware]] for the AIM, and users could also purchase optional [[read-only memory|ROM]] chips with an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] and a [[Microsoft BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] to choose from.\n\nFinally, there was the Synertek [[SYM-1]] variant, which could be said to be a machine halfway between the KIM and the AIM; it had the KIM's small display, and a simple [[membrane keyboard]] of 29 keys (hex digits and control keys only), but provided AIM-standard expansion interfaces and true [[RS-232]] (voltage level as well as current loop mode supported).\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:KIM-1 Computer Ad May 1976.jpg|thumb|right|The introductory advertisement for the KIM-1 microcomputer, April 1976]]\nThe KIM-1 consisted of a single [[printed circuit board]] with all the components on one side. It included three main [[integrated circuit|ICs]]; the MCS6502 CPU, and two [[MOS Technology RRIOT|MCS6530]] Peripheral Interface/Memory Devices.  Each MCS6530 comprises a mask programmable 1024 x 8 ROM, a 64 x 8 RAM, two 8 bit bi-directional ports, and a programmable interval timer.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = MCS6500 Microcomputer Family Hardware Manual\n  | publisher = MOS Technology Inc.\n  | date = January 1976\n  | location =\n  | pages = 71\n}}</ref> The KIM-1 brochure said \"1 K BYTE RAM\" but it actually had 1152 bytes. The memory was composed of eight 6102 static RAMs (1024 x 1 bits) and the two 64 byte RAMs of the MCS6530s. In the 1970s memory sizes were expressed in several ways. Semiconductor manufacturers would use a precise memory size such as 2048 by 8 and sometimes state the number of bits (16384). Mini and mainframe computers had various memory widths (8 bits to over 36 bits) so manufacturers would use the term \"words\", such as 4K words. The early hobbyist computer advertisements would use both \"words\" and \"bytes\".  It was common to see \"4096 words\", \"4K (4096) words\" and \"4 K bytes\". The term KB was unused or very uncommon.  The KIM-1 was introduced in the April 1976 issue of ''[[BYTE]]'' and the advertisement stated \"1 K BYTE RAM\" and \"2048 ROM BYTES\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | title = MOS KIM-1\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-04/1976_04_BYTE_00-08_Automation#page/n15/mode/2up\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 8\n  | pages = 15\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = April 1976\n}}</ref>\n\nAlso included were six [[Seven-segment display|7-segment]] [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] (similar to those on a pocket [[calculator]]) and a 24-key calculator-type keypad.\nMany of the pins of the I/O portions of the 6530s were connected to two connectors on the edge of the board, where they could be used as a [[serial communications|serial]] system for driving a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR and [[paper tape|paper tape reader/punch]]).\n\nOne of these connectors also doubled as the power supply connector, and included analog lines that could be attached to a [[cassette tape]] recorder.\n\nEarlier [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] used a series of switches on the front of the machine to enter data. In order to do anything useful, the user had to enter a small program known as the \"bootstrap loader\" into the machine using these switches, a process known as [[booting]]. Once loaded, the loader would be used to load a larger program off a storage device like a [[paper tape]] reader.  It would often take upwards of five minutes to load the tiny program into memory, and a single error while flipping the switches meant that the bootstrap loader would crash the machine. This could render some of the bootstrap code garbled, in which case the programmer had to reenter the whole thing and start all over again.\n\nThe KIM-1 included a somewhat more complex built-in Terminal Interface Monitor software called '''TIM''' that was \"contained in 2048 bytes of ROM in two 6530 ROM/RAM/IO arrays\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | title = What's New, KIM-o-sabee?\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-04/1976_04_BYTE_00-08_Automation#page/n15/mode/2up\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 8\n  | pages = 14\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = April 1976\n}}</ref> This monitor software included the ability to run a cassette tape for storage, drive the LED display, and run the keypad. As soon as the power was turned on, the monitor would run and the user could immediately start interacting with the machine via the keypad. The KIM-1 was one of the first [[single-board computer]]s, needing only an external power supply to enable its use as a stand-alone experimental computer.  This fact, plus the relatively low cost of getting started, made it quite popular with hobbyists through the late 1970s.\n\n== Video display ==\n[[File:PAiA TVT-6 Video Display Dec 1977.jpg| thumb|right|PAiA TVT-6 Video Display]]\nThe designer of the [[TV Typewriter]], [[Don Lancaster]], developed a low cost video display for the KIM-1. The add-on board would display up to 4000 characters on a TV or monitor. A typical configuration would be 16 lines of 32 upper case only characters. The board had only 10 low cost ICs and used the KIM's memory for the screen storage.\n\nThe TVT-6 project appeared on the cover on ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' in July 1977.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Lancaster\n  | first = Don\n  | title = Build the TVT-6: A Low-Cost Direct Video Display\n  | journal = Popular Electronics\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 47\u201352\n  | publisher = Ziff-Davis Publishing\n  | date = July 1977\n}}</ref> The complete kit could be ordered from [[PAiA Electronics]] for {{nowrap|$US34.95}}.\n\nLancaster expanded this design to do color and simple graphics in ''The Cheap Video Cookbook''.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Lancaster\n  | first = Don\n  | authorlink = Don Lancaster\n  | title = The Cheap Video Cookbook\n  | publisher = Howard W Sams\n  | year = 1978\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  0-672-21524-1\n}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n* CPU: [[MOS Technology 6502|MCS6502]]\n* 2x PIO [[MOS Technology RRIOT|MCS6530]] {{nowrap|1024 x 8 ROM}}, a {{nowrap|64 x 8 RAM}}, 2x 8-bit [[General Purpose Input/Output|bi-directional ports]], [[Programmable Interval Timer|programmable interval timer]]\n* 8x 6102 [[Static random access memory|static RAM]] 1024 x 1 (1024 bytes)\n* 6x [[Seven-segment display|7-segment]] [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]\n* 24-key calculator type [[keypad]]\n* 2x [[serial communications|serial]] ports\n* Terminal Interface Monitor (TIM), that handled [[booting]], keypad, seven-segment LEDs, and cassette tape\n\n== Tape format ==\n<!--Connected to application connector-->Each bit is represented by three 2.484 ms long tones.

It was very successful in that period, due to its low price (due to the inexpensive 6502) and easy-access expandability.\n\n[[Image:Kim-1-computer.jpg|thumb|right|KIM-1 computer in operation]]\n\n== History ==\nMOS Technology's first processor, the [[MOS Technology 6501|6501]], could be plugged into existing motherboards that used the [[Motorola 6800]], allowing potential users (i.e. engineers and hobbyists) to get a development system up and running very easily using existing hardware. [[Motorola]] immediately sued, forcing MOS to pull the 6501 from the market.  Changing the pin layout produced the \"lawsuit-friendly\" [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]. Otherwise identical to the 6501, it nevertheless had the disadvantage of having no machine in which new users could quickly start playing with the [[central processing unit|CPU]].\n\n[[Chuck Peddle]], leader of the 650x group at MOS (and former member of Motorola's 6800 team), designed the KIM-1 in order to fill this need. The KIM-1 came to market in 1976. While the machine was originally intended to be used by engineers, it quickly found a large audience with  hobbyists. A complete system could be constructed for under {{nowrap|500 US$}} with the purchase of the kit for only {{nowrap|245 US$}}, and then adding a power supply, a used [[Character-oriented terminal|terminal]] and a [[Kansas City standard|cassette tape drive]].\n\nMany books were available demonstrating small [[assembly language]] programs for the KIM, including ''The First Book of KIM'' by  [[Jim Butterfield]] ''et al''.<ref name=\"Butterfield, KIM, First Book of\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Butterfield  |first=Jim  |authorlink=Jim Butterfield\n  |year=1977\n  |url=https://archive.org/stream/The_First_Book_of_KIM#page/n0/mode/2up\n  |title=The First Book of KIM\n  |first2=Stan  |last2=Ockers  |first3=Eric  |last3=Rehnke\n  |isbn=0-8104-5119-0\n  |publisher=Hayden Book\n  |ref=Butterfield, KIM, First Book of\n}}</ref> One demo program converted the KIM into a music box by toggling a software-controllable output bit connected to a small [[loudspeaker]].  Canadian programmer [[Peter R. Jennings]] produced what was probably the first game for microcomputers to be sold commercially, ''[[Microchess]],'' originally for the KIM-1.\n\nAs the system became more popular one of the common additions was the [[Tiny BASIC|Tiny BASIC programming language]].\nThis required an easy memory expansion; \"all of the decoding for the first 4 K is provided right on the KIM board. All you need to provide is 4 K more of RAM chips and some buffers.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Simpson\n  | first = Richard\n  | title = A Date with KIM\n  | url = https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-05/1976_05_BYTE_00-09_Shooting_Stars#page/n9/mode/2up\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 9\n  | pages = 14\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = May 1976\n}}</ref> The hard part was loading the BASIC from [[cassette tape]]\u2014a 15-minute, error-prone ordeal.\n\n[[Rockwell International]]\u2014who second-sourced the 6502, along with [[Synertek]]\u2014released their own microcomputer in one board in 1978, the [[AIM 65]].  The AIM included a full [[ASCII]] keyboard, a 20-character [[fourteen segment display|14-segment]] [[alphanumeric]] [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and a small [[cash register]]-like printer.  A [[debugger|debug]] [[machine code monitor|monitor]] was provided as standard [[firmware]] for the AIM, and users could also purchase optional [[read-only memory|ROM]] chips with an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] and a [[Microsoft BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] to choose from.\n\nFinally, there was the Synertek [[SYM-1]] variant, which could be said to be a machine halfway between the KIM and the AIM; it had the KIM's small display, and a simple [[membrane keyboard]] of 29 keys (hex digits and control keys only), but provided AIM-standard expansion interfaces and true [[RS-232]] (voltage level as well as current loop mode supported).\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:KIM-1 Computer Ad May 1976.jpg|thumb|right|The introductory advertisement for the KIM-1 microcomputer, April 1976]]\nThe KIM-1 consisted of a single [[printed circuit board]] with all the components on one side. It included three main [[integrated circuit|ICs]]; the MCS6502 CPU, and two [[MOS Technology RRIOT|MCS6530]] Peripheral Interface/Memory Devices.  Each MCS6530 comprises a mask programmable 1024 x 8 ROM, a 64 x 8 RAM, two 8 bit bi-directional ports, and a programmable interval timer.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = MCS6500 Microcomputer Family Hardware Manual\n  | publisher = MOS Technology Inc.\n  | date = January 1976\n  | location =\n  | pages = 71\n}}</ref> The KIM-1 brochure said \"1 K BYTE RAM\" but it actually had 1152 bytes. The memory was composed of eight 6102 static RAMs (1024 x 1 bits) and the two 64 byte RAMs of the MCS6530s. In the 1970s memory sizes were expressed in several ways. Semiconductor manufacturers would use a precise memory size such as 2048 by 8 and sometimes state the number of bits (16384). Mini and mainframe computers had various memory widths (8 bits to over 36 bits) so manufacturers would use the term \"words\", such as 4K words. The early hobbyist computer advertisements would use both \"words\" and \"bytes\".  It was common to see \"4096 words\", \"4K (4096) words\" and \"4 K bytes\". The term KB was unused or very uncommon.  The KIM-1 was introduced in the April 1976 issue of ''[[BYTE]]'' and the advertisement stated \"1 K BYTE RAM\" and \"2048 ROM BYTES\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | title = MOS KIM-1\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-04/1976_04_BYTE_00-08_Automation#page/n15/mode/2up\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 8\n  | pages = 15\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = April 1976\n}}</ref>\n\nAlso included were six [[Seven-segment display|7-segment]] [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] (similar to those on a pocket [[calculator]]) and a 24-key calculator-type keypad.\nMany of the pins of the I/O portions of the 6530s were connected to two connectors on the edge of the board, where they could be used as a [[serial communications|serial]] system for driving a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR and [[paper tape|paper tape reader/punch]]).\n\nOne of these connectors also doubled as the power supply connector, and included analog lines that could be attached to a [[cassette tape]] recorder.\n\nEarlier [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] used a series of switches on the front of the machine to enter data. In order to do anything useful, the user had to enter a small program known as the \"bootstrap loader\" into the machine using these switches, a process known as [[booting]]. Once loaded, the loader would be used to load a larger program off a storage device like a [[paper tape]] reader.  It would often take upwards of five minutes to load the tiny program into memory, and a single error while flipping the switches meant that the bootstrap loader would crash the machine. This could render some of the bootstrap code garbled, in which case the programmer had to reenter the whole thing and start all over again.\n\nThe KIM-1 included a somewhat more complex built-in Terminal Interface Monitor software called '''TIM''' that was \"contained in 2048 bytes of ROM in two 6530 ROM/RAM/IO arrays\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | title = What's New, KIM-o-sabee?\n  | journal = BYTE\n  | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1976-04/1976_04_BYTE_00-08_Automation#page/n15/mode/2up\n  | volume = 1\n  | issue = 8\n  | pages = 14\n  | publisher = Byte Publications Inc\n  | date = April 1976\n}}</ref> This monitor software included the ability to run a cassette tape for storage, drive the LED display, and run the keypad. As soon as the power was turned on, the monitor would run and the user could immediately start interacting with the machine via the keypad. The KIM-1 was one of the first [[single-board computer]]s, needing only an external power supply to enable its use as a stand-alone experimental computer.  This fact, plus the relatively low cost of getting started, made it quite popular with hobbyists through the late 1970s.\n\n== Video display ==\n[[File:PAiA TVT-6 Video Display Dec 1977.jpg| thumb|right|PAiA TVT-6 Video Display]]\nThe designer of the [[TV Typewriter]], [[Don Lancaster]], developed a low cost video display for the KIM-1. The add-on board would display up to 4000 characters on a TV or monitor. A typical configuration would be 16 lines of 32 upper case only characters. The board had only 10 low cost ICs and used the KIM's memory for the screen storage.\n\nThe TVT-6 project appeared on the cover on ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' in July 1977.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Lancaster\n  | first = Don\n  | title = Build the TVT-6: A Low-Cost Direct Video Display\n  | journal = Popular Electronics\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 47\u201352\n  | publisher = Ziff-Davis Publishing\n  | date = July 1977\n}}</ref> The complete kit could be ordered from [[PAiA Electronics]] for {{nowrap|$US34.95}}.\n\nLancaster expanded this design to do color and simple graphics in ''The Cheap Video Cookbook''.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Lancaster\n  | first = Don\n  | authorlink = Don Lancaster\n  | title = The Cheap Video Cookbook\n  | publisher = Howard W Sams\n  | year = 1978\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  0-672-21524-1\n}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n* CPU: [[MOS Technology 6502|MCS6502]]\n* 2x PIO [[MOS Technology RRIOT|MCS6530]] {{nowrap|1024 x 8 ROM}}, a {{nowrap|64 x 8 RAM}}, 2x 8-bit [[General Purpose Input/Output|bi-directional ports]], [[Programmable Interval Timer|programmable interval timer]]\n* 8x 6102 [[Static random access memory|static RAM]] 1024 x 1 (1024 bytes)\n* 6x [[Seven-segment display|7-segment]] [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]\n* 24-key calculator type [[keypad]]\n* 2x [[serial communications|serial]] ports\n* Terminal Interface Monitor (TIM), that handled [[booting]], keypad, seven-segment LEDs, and cassette tape\n\n== Tape format ==\n<!--Connected to application connector-->Each bit is represented by three 2.484 ms long tones.

He is the voice of the promise of the \u201960s counterculture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock, who donned makeup in the \u201970s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse, who emerged to \u2018find Jesus,\u2019 who was written off as a has-been by the end of the \u201980s, and who suddenly shifted gears and released some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late \u201990s. \n\nFollowing [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional [[Folk-songs|folk songs]], Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' the following year. The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\". For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965), ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (1965) and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966). Commenting on the six-minute single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" (1965), ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: \"No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\"<ref name =LARS>{{cite web| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title = 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date = April 7, 2011| accessdate=January 6, 2020|work=[[Rolling Stone]]| archive-date=October 31, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031103816/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-2-54028/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes in ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later career include ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' (1997), ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|Love and Theft]]'' (2001), ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'' (2006) and ''[[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|Tempest]]'' (2012). In the 2010s, he recorded a series of three albums comprising versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]].

While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon.

Best regarded of these were \"[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]\", a tribute to the [[Blind Willie McTell|dead blues musician]] and an evocation of [[African American history]],<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 56\u201359.</ref> \"Foot of Pride\" and \"[[Lord Protect My Child]].\" These three songs were released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]''.<ref>Sounes, pp. 354\u2013356.</ref>\n\nBetween July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''.<ref name = Sounes362>Sounes, p. 362.</ref> [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album.

One reviewer commented that \"the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends.

artist who has been a major figure in [[popular culture]] for more than 50 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" (1963) and \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" (1964) became anthems for the [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied [[pop music]] conventions and appealed to the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nFollowing [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional [[Folk-songs|folk songs]], Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' the following year. The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\". For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965), ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (1965) and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966). Commenting on the six-minute single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" (1965), ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: \"No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\"<ref name =LARS>{{cite web| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title = 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date = April 7, 2011| accessdate=January 6, 2020|work=[[Rolling Stone]]| archive-date=October 31, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031103816/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-2-54028/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes in ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later career include ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' (1997), ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|Love and Theft]]'' (2001), ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'' (2006) and ''[[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|Tempest]]'' (2012). In the 2010s, he recorded a series of three albums comprising versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Dylan released his first original song in eight years in 2020, \"[[Murder Most Foul (song)|Murder Most Foul]]\", which addresses the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bob-dylan-murder-most-foul-974108/|author=Simon Vozick-Levinson|title=\u2018Murder Most Foul\u2019 Is the Bob Dylan Song We Need Right Now|date=27 March 2020|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the [[Never Ending Tour]].\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 100&nbsp;million records, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. He has received [[List of awards received by Bob Dylan|numerous awards]], including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], ten [[Grammy Award]]s, a [[Golden Globe Award]], and an [[Academy Award]]. Dylan has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] Board in 2008 awarded him a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special citation]] for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power\". In 2016, Dylan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".<ref name=NobelCite>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2016 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/press.pdf |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=October 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170920010410/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/press.pdf |archive-date=September 20, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1941\u20131959: Origins and musical beginnings===\n[[File:ZimmermanHouseHibbingMN.jpg|thumb|right|The Zimmerman family home in Hibbing, Minnesota]]\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ({{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd}} ''Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham'')<ref name =Sounes14>Sounes, p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham</ref><ref>A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate=January 6, 2020 | publisher=[[Chabad.org]]| archive-date=July 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728005159/https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/Bob-Dylans-Jewish-Odyssey.html|title=Bob Dylan's Jewish Odyssey|last=Preskovsky|first=Ilan|date=March 12, 2016|work=Aish.com|access-date=January 7, 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728005156/https://www.aish.com/ci/a/Bob-Dylans-Jewish-Odyssey.html|url-status=live}}</ref> in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]],<ref>Sounes, p. 14</ref><ref name=mnbirth>{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&indiv=try&db=mnbirth&h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935\u20132002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: May 24, 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H.

While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name \"Dylan\", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> In his memoir, he said he hit upon using this less common variant for ''Dillon''\u2014a surname he had considered adopting\u2014when he unexpectedly saw poems by [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Dylan, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents.

She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:{{cquote|She wanted me to be a writer. She said you can always write, no matter what you look like.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached her while Carol was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.<ref name=SILive>{{cite web|url=https://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/carol_burnett_on_staten_island.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711165327/https://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/carol_burnett_on_staten_island.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2018|title=Carol Burnett: 10 things to know before the comedy legend plays St. George|last=Bailey|first=Rob|work=[[Staten Island Advance]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Staten Island]]|date=April 3, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nInstead of reprimanding her, the man complimented her performance and asked about her future plans.

His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams.

They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time.

She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego. With her success on the ''Moore Show'', Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1962), co-starring with her friend [[Julie Andrews]].

She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, ''[[The Entertainers]]'', opposite [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Bob Newhart]].

Among other things, it parodied films (''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), television (''[[As the Stomach Turns]]'' for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShe opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib.

This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her; during the show's run, her grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: \"She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!\"<ref>[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''Intimate Portrait'' episode on Burnett</ref> She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on [[MeTV]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to [[Bob Mackie]], drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year's [[World Series]].<ref name= \"Heartbreak\"/> Her Grammy-winning memoir ''In Such Good Company'' is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s: Film roles===\n[[File:Carol Burnett - 1974.jpg|right|thumb|Burnett in 1974]]\nBurnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes [[Alan Alda]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). \n\n''Voice Roles'''\nIn 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. Her first was in ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan (film)|The Trumpet of the Swan]]'' in 2001.

In 1974, she appeared at [[the Muny]] Theatre in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title ''[[Password Plus]]'', when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''. In 2014, Burnett joined two-time Tony Award Winner, Brian Dennehy, on Broadway in A. R. Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor.

On the Buache map, \"Ile de Nachtegal\" is located at 43\u00b0S, 72\u00b0E, about 6 degrees north and 2 degrees east of the accepted location of Grande Terre.\n\nThe islands were officially discovered by the French navigator [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec]] on 12 February 1772.

Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Kerguelen's climate is considered to be an ''ET'' or [[tundra climate]], which is technically a form of [[polar climate]], as the average temperature in the warmest month is below {{convert|10|C}}.<ref name=\"Peel\">{{cite journal |last1=Peel |first1=Murray C. |last2=Finlayson |first2=Brian L. |last3=McMahon |first3=Thomas A. |year=2007 |title=Updated world map of the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate classification |journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1633\u20131644 |doi=10.5194/hess-11-1633-2007 |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.html |issn=1027-5606 |doi-access=free }} ''(direct: [http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf Final Revised Paper])''</ref> Comparable climates include the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] (New Zealand), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], [[Labrador]], and [[Wollaston Islands]].\n\nAll climate readings come from the [[Port-aux-Fran\u00e7ais]] base, which has one of the more favourable climates in Kerguelen because of its proximity to the coast and its location in a gulf sheltered from the wind.\n\nThe average annual temperature is {{convert|4.9|C}} with an annual range of around {{convert|6|C-change}}. The warmest months of the year include January and February, with average temperatures between {{convert|7.8|and|8.2|C}}. The coldest month of the year is August with an average temperature of {{convert|2.1|C}}. Annual high temperatures rarely surpass {{convert|20|C}}, while temperatures in winter have never been recorded below {{convert|\u221210|C}} at sea level.\n\nKerguelen receives frequent precipitation, with snow throughout the year as well as rain. Port-aux-Fran\u00e7ais receives a modest amount of precipitation ({{convert|708|mm|abbr=on}} per year) compared to the west coast which receives an estimated three times as much precipitation per year.\n\nThe mountains are frequently covered in snow but can thaw very quickly in rain. Over the course of several decades, many permanent glaciers have shown signs of retreat, with some smaller ones having disappeared completely.\n\nThe west coast receives almost continuous wind at an average speed of {{convert|35|km/h|abbr=on}} because the islands are between the [[Roaring Forties]] and the Furious Fifties. Wind speeds of {{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}} are common and can even reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWaves up to {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|abbr=on}} high are common, but there are many sheltered places where ships can dock.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Port-aux-Fran\u00e7ais, Kerguelen\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 22.3\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 21.0\n|Apr record high C = 23.0\n|May record high C = 16.8\n|Jun record high C = 14.5\n|Jul record high C = 13.4\n|Aug record high C = 14.4\n|Sep record high C = 15.8\n|Oct record high C = 19.1\n|Nov record high C = 21.3\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|Jan high C = 11.1\n|Feb high C = 11.5\n|Mar high C = 10.5\n|Apr high C = 9.0\n|May high C = 6.7\n|Jun high C = 5.2\n|Jul high C = 4.7\n|Aug high C = 4.6\n|Sep high C = 5.3\n|Oct high C = 7.0\n|Nov high C = 8.6\n|Dec high C = 10.1\n|year high C = 7.8\n|Jan mean C = 7.8\n|Feb mean C = 8.2\n|Mar mean C = 7.3\n|Apr mean C = 6.1\n|May mean C = 4.2\n|Jun mean C = 2.8\n|Jul mean C = 2.2\n|Aug mean C = 2.1\n|Sep mean C = 2.5\n|Oct mean C = 3.9\n|Nov mean C = 5.3\n|Dec mean C = 6.8\n|year mean C = 4.9\n|Jan low C = 4.4\n|Feb low C = 4.7\n|Mar low C = 4.1\n|Apr low C = 3.2\n|May low C = 1.5\n|Jun low C = 0.4\n|Jul low C = -0.3\n|Aug low C = -0.4\n|Sep low C = -0.2\n|Oct low C = 0.7\n|Nov low C = 2.0\n|Dec low C = 3.4\n|year low C = 1.9\n|Jan record low C = -1.5\n|Feb record low C = -1.0\n|Mar record low C = -0.9\n|Apr record low C = -2.7\n|May record low C = -5.9\n|Jun record low C = -8.3\n|Jul record low C = -8.0\n|Aug record low C = -9.5\n|Sep record low C = -7.7\n|Oct record low C = -5.0\n|Nov record low C = -3.7\n|Dec record low C = -1.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 72.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 49.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 57.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 59.6\n|May precipitation mm = 59.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 62.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 63.4\n|Sep precipitation mm = 62.3\n|Oct precipitation mm = 59.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 51.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 55.1\n|Jan humidity = 78\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 82\n|Apr humidity = 86\n|May humidity = 88\n|Jun humidity = 89\n|Jul humidity = 89\n|Aug humidity = 87\n|Sep humidity = 84\n|Oct humidity = 80\n|Nov humidity = 75\n|Dec humidity = 77\n|source 1 = MeteoStats<ref name=\"MeteoStats\">{{cite web |url=http://meteostats-bzh.ath.cx:93/meteostats/index.php?page=stati&id=23 |title=Le climat \u00e0 Port aux Fran\u00e7ais (en \u00b0C et mm, moyennes mensuelles 1971/2000 et records depuis 1973) sur MeteoStats }} {{dead link |date=January 2017 }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n{{Main|Flora and fauna of the Kerguelen Islands}}\n[[File:Pringlea antiscorbutica Mayes fake.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kerguelen cabbages]]\nThe islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands.

He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.''

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure.

C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research.

His first original invention, the [[Ballbarrow]], was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|title=Inside Dyson|publisher=Dyson|access-date=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018160236/http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|archive-date=18 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40&nbsp;mph) on both land and water.\n\n==Vacuum cleaners==\n[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|DC07 bagless [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\nIn the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using [[cyclonic separation]] to create a [[vacuum cleaner]] that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.'' [[Dyson (company)#History|History of Dyson Ltd]]).<ref name=JBD>Issue: ''The Journal of Business and Design'', vol. 8, no. 1</ref>\n\nPartly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and about 5,127 [[prototype]]s, Dyson launched the \"G-Force\" cleaner in 1983.<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/59549/failure-doesnt-suck|title=Failure Doesn't Suck|date=1 May 2007|work=Fast Company|accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would have disturbed the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/ceonetwork/2006/08/01/leadership-facetime-dyson-cx_hc_0801dyson.html | work=Forbes | title=James Dyson Cleans Up | date=1 August 2006}}</ref> Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of \u00a32,000. It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]].
