It grants the bearer international passage in accordance with [[Visa requirements for British citizens|visa requirements]] and serves as proof of citizenship. It also facilitates access to consular assistance from [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British embassies]] around the world. Passports are issued using royal prerogative, which is exercised by [[Her Majesty's Government]]. British citizen passports have been issued in the UK by [[Her Majesty's Passport Office]], a division of the [[Home Office]], since 2006.  All passports issued in the UK since 2006 have been biometric.\n\nThe legacy of [[British Empire|the United Kingdom as an imperial power]] has resulted in several types of British nationality, and different types of British passport exist as a result. All British passports enable the bearer to request consular assistance from British embassies and from certain Commonwealth embassies in some cases. British citizens can use their passport as evidence of [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough citizens of the UK and [[Gibraltar]] are no longer considered citizens of the [[Brexit|European Union]], the British citizen and Gibraltar passports allow for [[Citizens\u2019 Rights Directive|freedom of movement]] in any of the states of the [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]] until the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|EU withdrawal transition period]] ends on 31 December 2020. \n\nBetween 1920 and 1988, the standard design of British passports was a [[Navy blue|navy blue]] hardcover booklet featuring the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms]] emblazoned in gold. From 1988, the UK adopted [[Machine-readable passport|machine readable passports]] in accordance with the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] standard 9303. At this time, the passport colour was changed to burgundy red, in line with most other [[Passports of the European Union|European passports]]. The first generation of machine-readable passports attracted significant criticism for their perceived flimsiness, mass-produced nature and sudden deviation from the traditional design.<ref name=\"BBC1995\">{{cite web |last1=BBC Newsnight |title=Paxman on the new EU passport (Newsnight archives 1995) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBp-KPrJjSc |website=YouTube |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince the introduction of biometric passports, the British passport has introduced a new design every five years.<ref name=\"HMPO_newdesign\">{{cite web |last1=HM Passport Office |title=New UK passport design |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-uk-passport-design |website=GOV.UK |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> March 2020 saw the introduction of a new navy blue passport with a continuity design based on the last 1988 issue.<ref name=\"brexit-blue-dec-2017\">{{cite news|title=Blue passport to return after Brexit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42443253|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=22 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New blue British passport rollout to begin in March|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51585018 |accessdate=22 February 2020|work=BBC News|date=22 February 2020}} </ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51585018|title=Blue British passports to return in March|date=2020-02-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-02-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Timeline\n|-\n| Various changes to the design were made over the years:<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/hs.xsl/1080.htm |title=Passport history timeline 1414\u2013present |publisher=IPS |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref>\n* 1914: the first 'modern' passports featuring a photograph of the holder were issued.\n* 1915: passports featuring a cardboard cover, validity period, and description of the holder were first issued.\n* 1927: the country name changed from \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" to \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" (alternatively the name of the colony, territory, or protectorate appeared here).\n* 1954: the name of the Secretary of State was removed.\n* 1968: the validity was extended from five years renewable up to ten, to ten years non-renewable.\n* 1972, end: several modifications were made.

In Scotland, passports were issued by the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish Crown]] and could also issued on the Crown's behalf by [[Burgh|burghs]], senior churchmen and noblemen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scan.org.uk/familyhistory/myancestor/passport.htm|title=Family History - My ancestor was a passport holder|website=scan.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> Passports were still signed by the monarch until 1685, when the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] could sign them instead. The Secretary of State signed all passports in place of the monarch from 1794 onwards, at which time formal records started to be kept; all of these records still exist.  Passports were written in Latin or English until 1772, then in French until 1858.  Since that time, they have been written in English, with some sections translated into French. In 1855, passports became a standardised document issued solely to British nationals. They were a simple single-sheet hand-drafted paper document.\n\nSome duplicate passports and passport records are available at the [[British Library]]; for example IOR: L/P&J/11 contain a few surviving passports of travelling [[Amah (occupation)|ayahs]] from the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/history/history/asiansinbritain/ayahsservantsandsailors/britishayahs.html |title=British Library: Asians in Britain: Ayahs, Servants and Sailors |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> \nA passport issued on 18 June 1641 and signed by [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]] still exists.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, an increasing number of Britons began travelling abroad due to the advent of railways and travel services such as the[[Thomas Cook Continental Timetable]]. The speed of trains, as well as the number of passengers that crossed multiple borders, made enforcement of passport laws difficult, and many travellers did not carry a passport in this era.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/celebrate-being-canadian/teachers-corner/history-passports.html|title=History of Passports|last=Immigration|first=Refugees and Citizenship Canada|date=2014-04-10|website=aem|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> However, the outbreak of [[World War I]] led to the introduction of modern [[Border control|border controls]], including in the UK with passage of the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]]. Thus, in 1915 the British government developed a new format of passport that could be mass-produced and used to quickly identify the bearer. The new passport consisted of a printed sheet folded into eight and affixed to a clothed cardboard cover. It included a description of the holder as well as a photograph, and had to be renewed after two years.\n\n===Passport booklets (1921-1993)===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:center; width:400px;\"\n| [[File:UK passport 1924.JPG|175px]] [[File:UK Passport Pre 88 change.jpg|175px]]<br />UK passport issued in 1924 (left) and 1991 (right).\n|}\nIn October 1920, the [[League of Nations]] held the [[Paris Conference on Passports & Customs Formalities and Through Tickets]]. British diplomats joined with 42 countries to draft passport guidelines and a general booklet design resulted from the conference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1111001/passport-design-worldwide-was-first-standardized-by-the-league-of-nations-paris-conference-of-1920/|title=The design of every passport in the world was set at one 1920 meeting|last=Quito|first=Anne|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The League model specified a 32-page booklet of 15.5 cm by 10.5 cm (6.1 inches by 4.1 inches). The first four pages were reserved for detailing the bearer's physical characteristics, occupation and residence.\n\nThe British government formed the [[HM_Passport_Office#History|Passport Service]] in the same year and in 1921 began issuing 32-page passports with a navy blue hardcover with an embossed coat of arms. \"BRITISH PASSPORT\" was the common identifier printed at the top of all booklets, while the name of the issuing government was printed below the coat of arms (e.g. United Kingdom, New Zealand, Hong Kong). Cut-outs in the cover allowed the bearer's name and the passport number to be displayed. This format would remain the standard for most British passports until the introduction of machine-readable passports in 1988. It continued to be issued in the United Kingdom until the end of 1993.\n\nAs with many contemporary travel documents worldwide, details were handwritten into the passport and (as of 1955) included: number, holder's name, \"accompanied by his wife\" and her maiden name, \"and\" (number) \"children\", national status. For both bearer and wife: profession, place and date of birth, country of residence, height, eye and hair colour, special peculiarities, signature and photograph. Names, birth dates, and sexes of children, list of countries for which valid, issue place and date, expiry date, a page for renewals and, at the back, details of the amount of foreign exchange for travel expenses (a limited amount of sterling, typically \u00a350 but increasing with inflation, could be taken out of the country).<ref>Printed information from 1955 passport</ref> The bearer's sex was not explicitly stated, although the name was written in with title (\"Mr John Smith\"). Descriptive text was printed in both English and French (a practice which {{As of|2010|alt=still}} continues), e.g., \"Accompanied by his wife (Maiden name)/Accompagn\u00e9 de sa femme (N\u00e9e)\". Changed details were struck out and rewritten, with a [[rubber-stamp]]ed note confirming the change.\n\nIf details and photograph of a man's wife and details of children were entered (this was not compulsory), the passport could be used by the bearer, wife, and children under 16, if together; separate passports were required for the wife or children to travel independently.<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"A passport including particulars of the holder's wife is not available for the wife's use when she is travelling alone.\"</ref> The passport was valid for five years, renewable for another five, after which it had to be replaced.<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"... available for five years in the first instance, ... may be renewed for further periods ... provided ... ten years from the original date is not exceeded.\"</ref>\n\nRenewal of a passport required physical cancellation of the old passport, which was then returned to the bearer.  The top-right corner of its front cover was cut off and \"CANCELLED\" was stamped into one or both of the cut-outs in the front cover, which showed the passport number and the bearer's name, as well on the pages showing the bearer's details and the document's validity.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the passport had a printed list of countries for which it was valid, which was added to manually as validity increased. A passport issued in 1955 was valid for the British Commonwealth, USA, and all countries in Europe \"including the [[USSR]], Turkey, Algeria, Azores, Canary Islands, Iceland, and Madeira\";<ref>1955 passport, printed on page 4</ref> during its period of validity restrictions eased and it was endorsed \"and for all other foreign countries\".<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"... only available for travel to the countries named on page 4, but may be endorsed for other countries. ... available for travelling to territory under British protection or trusteeship not including the Aden Protectorate.\"</ref>\n====The British visitor's passport====\nA new simplified type, the British Visitor's Passport, was introduced in 1961.  It was a single sheet of cardboard, folded in three so as to consist of six pages the same size as those of a regular passport, and was valid for one year.  It was obtainable for many years from [[Employment Exchange]]s, as agents of the Passport Office, and later from a [[Royal Mail|Post Office]]. It was accepted for travel by most west European countries (excluding surface travel to [[West Berlin]]), but was dropped in 1995 since it did not meet new security standards.  A cancelled passport, which was returned to the bearer, had its top-right corner cut off, which had the effect of removing a corner from every page.\n\n===Machine-readable passports (1988-2006)===\n[[File:British passport (european community).jpg|thumb|213x213px|[[European Economic Community|European Community]] passport as introduced in 1988 before the Community became the [[European Union]]]]\nAfter the passport standardisation efforts of the 1920s, further effort to update international passport guidance was limited.

In 1986, the [[United States]] announced the [[Visa Waiver Program|US Visa Waiver Program]]. The concept allowed for passport holders of certain countries to enter the US for business or tourism without applying for a visitor visa. The UK was the first country to join the scheme in 1988, however a requirement was that the traveller hold a machine-readable passport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Visa Waiver Program Requirements |url=https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program-requirements |website=Department of Homeland Security |accessdate=19 April 2020 |language=en |date=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wasem |first1=Ruth Ellen |title=The US Visa Waiver Program Facilitating Travel and Enhancing Security |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2017-10-25-us-visa-waiver-wasem.pdf |publisher=Chatham House |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> Thus, the British government was, after nearly 70 years, forced to retire the traditional navy blue League of Nations format passport.\n[[File:British passport 2002.jpg|thumb|218x218px|Non-biometric European Union passport issued after 1997]]\nWith the move to machine-readable passports, the UK decided to adopt the European Community format. On 15 August 1988, the [[Glasgow]] passport office became the first to issue burgundy-coloured machine-readable passports. They had the words 'European Community' on the cover, later changed to '[[European Union]]' in 1997. The passport had 32 pages; while a 48-page version was made available with more space for stamps and visas. Two lines of machine-readable text were printed in ICAO format, and a section was included in which relevant terms (\"surname\", \"date of issue\", etc.) were translated into the official EU languages. Passports issued overseas did not all have a Machine Readable Zone but these were introduced gradually as appropriate equipment was made available overseas. \n\nWhile other British territories such as [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] were not part of the European Community, they also adopted the same European format, although \"British Passport\" remained at the top rather than \"European Community\".\n\nIn 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0558EDFB-4E6B9B37/ips_live/hs.xsl/205.htm |title=Identity and Passport Service &#124; Home Office |publisher=Ips.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> the first [[digital image]] passport was introduced with photographs being replaced with images printed directly on the data page which was moved from the cover to an inside page to reduce the ease of fraud. These documents were all issued with machine-readable zones and had a hologram over the photograph, which was the first time that British passports had been protected by an optically variable safeguard.

An [[RFID]] chip and antenna were visible on the official observations page and held the same visual information as printed, including a digital copy of the photograph with biometric information for use with [[facial recognition system]]s.

The biometric chip was relocated from the official observations page to inside the cover, and the observations page itself was moved from the back of the passport to immediately after the data page. All new art was produced for version 2, this time with a coastal theme. Data and visa pages featured coastal scenes, wildlife and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] symbols.<ref name=\"HMPO_checks\"/>\n\nRenewal of the passport required physical cancellation of the old passport, which was then returned to the bearer.  The top-right corners of its front and back covers were cut off, as well as the top-right corner of the final pair of pages, which had been bound in plastic with the bearer's details and a digital chip;  a white bar-coded form stating \"Renewal\" and the bearer's personal details was stuck onto the back cover.\n[[File:British_Passport_cover_2010_(non-EU).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Series B biometric passport issued after March 2019]]\n\n====Series B (2015-2020)====\nHMPO's contract with De La Rue involved the design of a new generation of biometric passport, which was released in October 2015 as the Series B passport. The cover design remained the same as Series A, with minor changes to the cover material. The number of pages of a standard passport was increased from 32 to 34, and the 50-page 'jumbo' passport replaced the previous 48-page business passport. New security features included rich three-dimensional [[ultraviolet|UV]] imagery, cross-page printing and a single-sheet bio-data page joined with the back cover.

Either of these features enabled automatic distinction between BOTCs related to different territories. Ever since the HMPO assumed the responsibility of the issuance of BOTC passports in 2015, however, the code of issuing state is changed to GBD for all territories, thus making it impossible to identify the holder's domicile without the aid of other features, such as the passport cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=UK passport office blamed for travel woes|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/news/article/20170311/uk-passport-office-blamed-for-travel-woes|website=royalgazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Special British passports===\n\n\n'''Diplomatic''' passports are issued in the UK by HMPO.

Emergency passports may be issued to any person holding British nationality.

They were therefore considered to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] until 31 January 2020 when the [[Brexit|UK withdrew from the EU]]. As a result, passports issued to these nationals were considered to be [[Passports of the European Union|EU passports]]. British passports with EU status facilitated access to consular assistance from another [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member state]].\n\nBritish nationals formerly holding EU status continue to enjoy free movement within the [[European Economic Area]] and Switzerland until the [[Brexit transition period]] ends 31 December 2020 or later. The right to live, and work in the Republic of Ireland will continue for British citizens, as the British citizens are not treated as aliens under Irish law. [[Common Travel Area]] arrangements for visa-free travel remain unchanged.\nOther types of British national were not considered to be EU citizens, but may nevertheless enjoy [[Visa policy of the European union|visa-free travel to the European Union on a short-term basis]].\n\n==Physical appearance==\n===Outside cover===\nCurrent issue British passports are navy blue or burgundy, with the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] emblazoned in the centre of the front cover.\n\"BRITISH PASSPORT\" is inscribed above the coat of arms, and the name of the issuing government is inscribed below (e.g. \"UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND\" or \"TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS\"). Where a British national is connected to a territory that is no longer under British sovereignty (e.g. BN(O) in Hong Kong), the issuing government is the United Kingdom. The [[biometric passport]] symbol [[File:EPassport logo.svg|20px]] appears at the bottom of the front cover.\n\nBurgundy passports issued by the UK, Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies follow a different format, as they are based on the EU common model. The words \"UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND\" (+ \"GIBRALTAR\" where relevant) or \"BRITISH ISLANDS\" (+ the Dependency's name) are inscribed above the coat of arms, whilst the word \"PASSPORT\" is inscribed below.\n\nThe rear cover of blue passports are also embossed with the [[floral emblem#United Kingdom|floral emblem]]s of [[England]] ([[Tudor rose]]), [[Northern Ireland]] ([[Shamrock]]), [[Scotland]] ([[Scotch thistle]]) and [[Wales]] ([[daffodil]]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Function-related passports====\nBesides the ordinary passports described above, special passports are issued to government officials from which diplomatic status may (diplomatic passport) or may not (official passport) be conferred by the text on the cover. Until 2014 a special passport was available for a [[Queen's Messenger]], which had on its cover the text \"QUEEN\u2019S MESSENGER \u2013 COURRIER DIPLOMATIQUE\" below the coat of arms and the text \"BRITISH PASSPORT\" above it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cover of a Queen's Messenger's passport |work=[[Council of the European Union]] |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/EN/2658/docHome.html |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Inside cover===\nUK issue British passports contain on their inside cover the following words in English only:\n\n{{quote|''Her [[Britannic Majesty]]'s Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary.''}}\n\nIn older passports, more specific reference was made to \"Her Britannic Majesty's Principal [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]]\", originally including the name of the incumbent. In non-UK issue passports, the request is made by the governor or lieutenant-governor of the territory in \"the Name of Her Britannic Majesty\".\n\n===Information page===\n\nBritish passports issued by HM Passport Office include the following data on the information page:\n\n* Photograph of the owner/holder (digital image printed on page)\n* Type (P)\n* Code of issuing state (GBR)\n* Passport number\n* Surname (see note below regarding titles)\n* Given names\n* Nationality (the [[British nationality law|class of British nationality]], such as \"British Citizen\" or \"British Overseas Citizen\", or if issued on behalf of a Commonwealth country, \"Commonwealth Citizen\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/IDIs/idichapter22/section2/section2.pdf?view=Binary |title=United Kingdom Border Agency: Immigration Directorates' Instructions, Chapter 22, Section 2(3) |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref>)\n* Date of birth\n* Sex (Gender)\n* Place of birth (only the city or town is listed, even if born outside the UK; places of birth in Wales are entered in Welsh upon request <ref>{{cite web|title=Welsh language|work=[[Identity and Passport Service]]|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/files/ips/live/assets/documents/Passport_policy_-_Welsh_Language_(2).pdf|accessdate=27 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209134916/http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/files/ips/live/assets/documents/Passport_policy_-_Welsh_Language_(2).pdf|archive-date=9 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>)\n* Date of issue\n* Authority\n* Date of expiry\n* [[Machine-readable passport|Machine-readable zone]] starting with P< GBR\n\nThe items are identified by text in English and French (e.g., \"Date of birth/Date de naissance\"), and there is a section in which all this text is translated into Welsh and Scottish Gaelic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welsh and Scottish Gaelic in UK Passports|work=[[Identity and Passport Service]]|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/sitemap_XML.xsl/379.htm?advanced=&searchoperator=&searchmodifier=&verb=&search_date_from=&search_date_to=&stage=&search_event_subject=&search_category=&search_query=&search_scope=&search_group=&varChunk=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804173130/http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/sitemap_XML.xsl/379.htm?advanced=&searchoperator=&searchmodifier=&verb=&search_date_from=&search_date_to=&stage=&search_event_subject=&search_category=&search_query=&search_scope=&search_group=&varChunk=|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2012|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Passports issued until March 2019 were translated into all official [[languages of the European Union|EU languages]].\n\nAccording to the UK government, the current policy of using noble titles on passports requires that the applicant provides evidence that the [[Lord Lyon]] has recognised a feudal barony, or the title is included in [[Burke's Peerage]]. If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen''). The official observation would then show the holder's full name, followed by their feudal title e.g. ''The holder is John Smith, Baron of Inverglen''.\n\n===Official Observations page===\n\nCertain British passports are issued with printed endorsements on the Official Observations page, usually in [[Letter case|upper case]] (capital letters). They form part of the passport when it is issued, as distinct from immigration stamps subsequently entered in the visa pages. Some examples are:<ref name=\"UKPO\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118562/observations-passports.pdf |title=Guidance: Observations in passports |publisher=HM Passport Office |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref><ref name=\"bnopass\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118595/british-national-dep-citizens.pdf |title=British National (Overseas) and British Dependent Territories Citizens |publisher=HM Passport Office |date= |accessdate=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n* ''The Holder is not entitled to benefit from European Union provisions relating to employment or establishment''\n\n:British citizens from Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man without a qualifying connection to the United Kingdom by descent or residency for more than five years have this endorsement in their passports.

Such persons would continue to have right of abode or right to land in Hong Kong after the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] in 1997 under the Immigration Ordinance.

However, even though a BN(O) passport does not entitle the holder the right of abode in the UK, this endorsement is not found in BN(O) passports (1999 and biometric versions).\n\n* ''In accordance with the United Kingdom immigration rules the holder of this passport does not require an entry certificate or visa to visit the United Kingdom''\n\n:This endorsement is found in BN(O) passports, and accordingly holders of BN(O) passports are allowed to enter the UK as a visitor without an [[entry certificate]] or visa for up to six months per entry.\n\n* ''The Holder is also a British National (Overseas)''\n\n:British citizens who also possess BN(O) status will have this endorsement in their passports to signify their additional status, as the two passports cannot be held at the same time.<ref name=\"bnopass\" />\n\n* ''The Holder is'' or ''The Holder is also known as ...''\n\n:This endorsement is found in passports where the holder uses or retains another professional, [[Stage name|stage]] or [[religious name]] and is known by it \"for all purposes\", or has a recognised form of address, academic, feudal or legal title (e.g. [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]], [[European Engineer]], [[Queen's Counsel]], [[Professor]], Minister of Religion) regarded as important identifiers of an individual.<ref name=\"UKPO\" /> The styling 'Dr ...', 'Professor ...' or similar is recorded here, or the alternative professional/stage/religious name, usually on request by the passport holder.<ref name=\"UKPO\" /> For example, [[Cliff Richard]]'s birth name was Harry Webb, and the passport Observations page would read:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Holder is also known as Cliff Richard\"\n</blockquote>\n\n:This endorsement is also found in the passport of persons with Peerage titles, members of the Privy Council, holders of knighthoods and other decorations, etc, to declare the holder's title.\n\n:Also, this endorsement is found if the passport holder's name is too long to fit within the 30-character limits (including spaces) on the passport information page; applies to each line reserved for the surname and the first [[given name]] including any [[middle name]](s).<ref name=\"UKPN\">{{cite web|url=https://passportapplication.service.gov.uk/help/html/pages/10.05_01_name-to-appear_en.html |title=GOV.UK: Name to appear on passport? |publisher=GOV.UK, HM Passport Office |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> In this scenario the holder's full name will be written out in full on the Observations page.<ref name=\"UKPN\" /> According to the UK passport agency guidelines, a person with a long or multiple given name, which cannot fit within the 30-character passport information page limits, should enter as much of the first given name, followed by the initials of all middle names (if any).<ref name=\"UKPN\" /> The same advice applies to a long or multiple surname.

After the handover, British passport issued in Hong Kong can only be issued at the British Consulate-General, and this endorsement is no longer in use. (See also: [[Chinese commercial code]])\n\n* ''Holder is a dependant of a member of Her Britannic Majesty's Diplomatic Service''\n\n:This endorsement is found in British passports held by people who are dependants or spouses of British diplomats.\n\n==Multiple passports==\nPeople who have valid reasons may be allowed to hold more than one passport booklet. This applies usually to people who travel frequently on business, and may need to have a passport booklet to travel on while the other is awaiting a visa for another country. Some Muslim-majority countries including [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]] do not issue visas to visitors if their passports bear a stamp or visa issued by Israel, as a result of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]].

Persons who acquired their BOTC status with a connection to Gibraltar or Falkland Islands, however, are not eligible due to differences in regulations, and their BOTC passports will be cancelled when their British citizen passports are issued even when they possess both citizenships.<ref name=\"bnopass\" />\n\n==Monarch==\nThe Queen, [[Elizabeth II]], does not have a passport because passports are issued in her name and on her authority, thus making it superfluous for her to hold one.<ref name=\"Queen\">{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/passports|title=Passports|first=Ciara|last=Berry|date=15 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref> All other members of the [[British royal family|royal family]], however, including the Queen's husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and their son, [[heir apparent]] [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], do have passports.<ref name=\"Queen\"/>\n\n==Visa requirements==\n[[File:Visa requirements for British citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for British citizens]]{{legend|#FDC421|United Kingdom}}{{legend|#042E9B|Freedom of movement (until 31 December 2020 assuming transitional period will not be extended)}}{{legend|#22B14C|Visa not required}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa on arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|#A8ACAB|Visa required prior to arrival}}|alt=]]\n{{main|Visa requirements for British citizens}}\n{{see also|Visa requirements for British Overseas Territories Citizens}}\n{{see also|Visa requirements for British Overseas Citizens}}\n{{see also|Visa requirements for British Nationals (Overseas)}}\nVisa requirements for [[British citizen]]s are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the [[United Kingdom]].

It grants the bearer international passage in accordance with [[Visa requirements for British citizens|visa requirements]] and serves as proof of citizenship. It also facilitates access to consular assistance from [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British embassies]] around the world. Passports are issued using royal prerogative, which is exercised by [[Her Majesty's Government]]. British citizen passports have been issued in the UK by [[Her Majesty's Passport Office]], a division of the [[Home Office]], since 2006.  All passports issued in the UK since 2006 have been biometric.\n\nThe legacy of [[British Empire|the United Kingdom as an imperial power]] has resulted in several types of British nationality, and different types of British passport exist as a result. All British passports enable the bearer to request consular assistance from British embassies and from certain Commonwealth embassies in some cases.

The Secretary of State signed all passports in place of the monarch from 1794 onwards, at which time formal records started to be kept; all of these records still exist.  Passports were written in Latin or English until 1772, then in French until 1858.  Since that time, they have been written in English, with some sections translated into French. In 1855, passports became a standardised document issued solely to British nationals. They were a simple single-sheet hand-drafted paper document.\n\nSome duplicate passports and passport records are available at the [[British Library]]; for example IOR: L/P&J/11 contain a few surviving passports of travelling [[Amah (occupation)|ayahs]] from the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/history/history/asiansinbritain/ayahsservantsandsailors/britishayahs.html |title=British Library: Asians in Britain: Ayahs, Servants and Sailors |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> \nA passport issued on 18 June 1641 and signed by [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]] still exists.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, an increasing number of Britons began travelling abroad due to the advent of railways and travel services such as the[[Thomas Cook Continental Timetable]]. The speed of trains, as well as the number of passengers that crossed multiple borders, made enforcement of passport laws difficult, and many travellers did not carry a passport in this era.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/celebrate-being-canadian/teachers-corner/history-passports.html|title=History of Passports|last=Immigration|first=Refugees and Citizenship Canada|date=2014-04-10|website=aem|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> However, the outbreak of [[World War I]] led to the introduction of modern [[Border control|border controls]], including in the UK with passage of the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]]. Thus, in 1915 the British government developed a new format of passport that could be mass-produced and used to quickly identify the bearer. The new passport consisted of a printed sheet folded into eight and affixed to a clothed cardboard cover. It included a description of the holder as well as a photograph, and had to be renewed after two years.\n\n===Passport booklets (1921-1993)===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:center; width:400px;\"\n| [[File:UK passport 1924.JPG|175px]] [[File:UK Passport Pre 88 change.jpg|175px]]<br />UK passport issued in 1924 (left) and 1991 (right).\n|}\nIn October 1920, the [[League of Nations]] held the [[Paris Conference on Passports & Customs Formalities and Through Tickets]]. British diplomats joined with 42 countries to draft passport guidelines and a general booklet design resulted from the conference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1111001/passport-design-worldwide-was-first-standardized-by-the-league-of-nations-paris-conference-of-1920/|title=The design of every passport in the world was set at one 1920 meeting|last=Quito|first=Anne|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The League model specified a 32-page booklet of 15.5 cm by 10.5 cm (6.1 inches by 4.1 inches). The first four pages were reserved for detailing the bearer's physical characteristics, occupation and residence.\n\nThe British government formed the [[HM_Passport_Office#History|Passport Service]] in the same year and in 1921 began issuing 32-page passports with a navy blue hardcover with an embossed coat of arms. \"BRITISH PASSPORT\" was the common identifier printed at the top of all booklets, while the name of the issuing government was printed below the coat of arms (e.g. United Kingdom, New Zealand, Hong Kong). Cut-outs in the cover allowed the bearer's name and the passport number to be displayed. This format would remain the standard for most British passports until the introduction of machine-readable passports in 1988. It continued to be issued in the United Kingdom until the end of 1993.\n\nAs with many contemporary travel documents worldwide, details were handwritten into the passport and (as of 1955) included: number, holder's name, \"accompanied by his wife\" and her maiden name, \"and\" (number) \"children\", national status. For both bearer and wife: profession, place and date of birth, country of residence, height, eye and hair colour, special peculiarities, signature and photograph. Names, birth dates, and sexes of children, list of countries for which valid, issue place and date, expiry date, a page for renewals and, at the back, details of the amount of foreign exchange for travel expenses (a limited amount of sterling, typically \u00a350 but increasing with inflation, could be taken out of the country).<ref>Printed information from 1955 passport</ref> The bearer's sex was not explicitly stated, although the name was written in with title (\"Mr John Smith\"). Descriptive text was printed in both English and French (a practice which {{As of|2010|alt=still}} continues), e.g., \"Accompanied by his wife (Maiden name)/Accompagn\u00e9 de sa femme (N\u00e9e)\". Changed details were struck out and rewritten, with a [[rubber-stamp]]ed note confirming the change.\n\nIf details and photograph of a man's wife and details of children were entered (this was not compulsory), the passport could be used by the bearer, wife, and children under 16, if together; separate passports were required for the wife or children to travel independently.<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"A passport including particulars of the holder's wife is not available for the wife's use when she is travelling alone.\"</ref> The passport was valid for five years, renewable for another five, after which it had to be replaced.<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"... available for five years in the first instance, ... may be renewed for further periods ... provided ... ten years from the original date is not exceeded.\"</ref>\n\nRenewal of a passport required physical cancellation of the old passport, which was then returned to the bearer.  The top-right corner of its front cover was cut off and \"CANCELLED\" was stamped into one or both of the cut-outs in the front cover, which showed the passport number and the bearer's name, as well on the pages showing the bearer's details and the document's validity.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the passport had a printed list of countries for which it was valid, which was added to manually as validity increased. A passport issued in 1955 was valid for the British Commonwealth, USA, and all countries in Europe \"including the [[USSR]], Turkey, Algeria, Azores, Canary Islands, Iceland, and Madeira\";<ref>1955 passport, printed on page 4</ref> during its period of validity restrictions eased and it was endorsed \"and for all other foreign countries\".<ref>1955 British passport, Notes section at back: \"... only available for travel to the countries named on page 4, but may be endorsed for other countries. ... available for travelling to territory under British protection or trusteeship not including the Aden Protectorate.\"</ref>\n====The British visitor's passport====\nA new simplified type, the British Visitor's Passport, was introduced in 1961.  It was a single sheet of cardboard, folded in three so as to consist of six pages the same size as those of a regular passport, and was valid for one year.  It was obtainable for many years from [[Employment Exchange]]s, as agents of the Passport Office, and later from a [[Royal Mail|Post Office]]. It was accepted for travel by most west European countries (excluding surface travel to [[West Berlin]]), but was dropped in 1995 since it did not meet new security standards.  A cancelled passport, which was returned to the bearer, had its top-right corner cut off, which had the effect of removing a corner from every page.\n\n===Machine-readable passports (1988-2006)===\n[[File:British passport (european community).jpg|thumb|213x213px|[[European Economic Community|European Community]] passport as introduced in 1988 before the Community became the [[European Union]]]]\nAfter the passport standardisation efforts of the 1920s, further effort to update international passport guidance was limited.

In 1986, the [[United States]] announced the [[Visa Waiver Program|US Visa Waiver Program]]. The concept allowed for passport holders of certain countries to enter the US for business or tourism without applying for a visitor visa. The UK was the first country to join the scheme in 1988, however a requirement was that the traveller hold a machine-readable passport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Visa Waiver Program Requirements |url=https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program-requirements |website=Department of Homeland Security |accessdate=19 April 2020 |language=en |date=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wasem |first1=Ruth Ellen |title=The US Visa Waiver Program Facilitating Travel and Enhancing Security |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2017-10-25-us-visa-waiver-wasem.pdf |publisher=Chatham House |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> Thus, the British government was, after nearly 70 years, forced to retire the traditional navy blue League of Nations format passport.\n[[File:British passport 2002.jpg|thumb|218x218px|Non-biometric European Union passport issued after 1997]]\nWith the move to machine-readable passports, the UK decided to adopt the European Community format. On 15 August 1988, the [[Glasgow]] passport office became the first to issue burgundy-coloured machine-readable passports. They had the words 'European Community' on the cover, later changed to '[[European Union]]' in 1997. The passport had 32 pages; while a 48-page version was made available with more space for stamps and visas. Two lines of machine-readable text were printed in ICAO format, and a section was included in which relevant terms (\"surname\", \"date of issue\", etc.) were translated into the official EU languages. Passports issued overseas did not all have a Machine Readable Zone but these were introduced gradually as appropriate equipment was made available overseas. \n\nWhile other British territories such as [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] were not part of the European Community, they also adopted the same European format, although \"British Passport\" remained at the top rather than \"European Community\".\n\nIn 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0558EDFB-4E6B9B37/ips_live/hs.xsl/205.htm |title=Identity and Passport Service &#124; Home Office |publisher=Ips.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> the first [[digital image]] passport was introduced with photographs being replaced with images printed directly on the data page which was moved from the cover to an inside page to reduce the ease of fraud. These documents were all issued with machine-readable zones and had a hologram over the photograph, which was the first time that British passports had been protected by an optically variable safeguard. These documents were issued until 2006 when the biometric passport was introduced.\n\n<br />\n\n===Biometric passports (2006-present)===\n[[File:British_biometric_passport.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Series A biometric UK passport]]\n====Series A (2006-2015)====\nIn the late 1990s, ICAO's Technical Advisory Group began developing a new standard for storing biometric data (e.g. photo, fingerprints, iris scan) on a [[Radio-frequency identification|chip]] embedded in a passport.

The biometric chip was relocated from the official observations page to inside the cover, and the observations page itself was moved from the back of the passport to immediately after the data page. All new art was produced for version 2, this time with a coastal theme. Data and visa pages featured coastal scenes, wildlife and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] symbols.<ref name=\"HMPO_checks\"/>\n\nRenewal of the passport required physical cancellation of the old passport, which was then returned to the bearer.  The top-right corners of its front and back covers were cut off, as well as the top-right corner of the final pair of pages, which had been bound in plastic with the bearer's details and a digital chip;  a white bar-coded form stating \"Renewal\" and the bearer's personal details was stuck onto the back cover.\n[[File:British_Passport_cover_2010_(non-EU).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Series B biometric passport issued after March 2019]]\n\n====Series B (2015-2020)====\nHMPO's contract with De La Rue involved the design of a new generation of biometric passport, which was released in October 2015 as the Series B passport. The cover design remained the same as Series A, with minor changes to the cover material. The number of pages of a standard passport was increased from 32 to 34, and the 50-page 'jumbo' passport replaced the previous 48-page business passport.

Previously, in the machine-readable zone, the three-letter [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code of the territory is given in the field of the code of issuing state, while GBD (British Overseas Territories citizens, formerly British Dependent Territories citizens) is shown in the nationality field. Either of these features enabled automatic distinction between BOTCs related to different territories. Ever since the HMPO assumed the responsibility of the issuance of BOTC passports in 2015, however, the code of issuing state is changed to GBD for all territories, thus making it impossible to identify the holder's domicile without the aid of other features, such as the passport cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=UK passport office blamed for travel woes|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/news/article/20170311/uk-passport-office-blamed-for-travel-woes|website=royalgazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Special British passports===\n\n\n'''Diplomatic''' passports are issued in the UK by HMPO.

Emergency passports may be issued to any person holding British nationality.

They were therefore considered to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] until 31 January 2020 when the [[Brexit|UK withdrew from the EU]]. As a result, passports issued to these nationals were considered to be [[Passports of the European Union|EU passports]]. British passports with EU status facilitated access to consular assistance from another [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member state]].\n\nBritish nationals formerly holding EU status continue to enjoy free movement within the [[European Economic Area]] and Switzerland until the [[Brexit transition period]] ends 31 December 2020 or later. The right to live, and work in the Republic of Ireland will continue for British citizens, as the British citizens are not treated as aliens under Irish law.

Where a British national is connected to a territory that is no longer under British sovereignty (e.g. BN(O) in Hong Kong), the issuing government is the United Kingdom. The [[biometric passport]] symbol [[File:EPassport logo.svg|20px]] appears at the bottom of the front cover.\n\nBurgundy passports issued by the UK, Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies follow a different format, as they are based on the EU common model. The words \"UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND\" (+ \"GIBRALTAR\" where relevant) or \"BRITISH ISLANDS\" (+ the Dependency's name) are inscribed above the coat of arms, whilst the word \"PASSPORT\" is inscribed below.\n\nThe rear cover of blue passports are also embossed with the [[floral emblem#United Kingdom|floral emblem]]s of [[England]] ([[Tudor rose]]), [[Northern Ireland]] ([[Shamrock]]), [[Scotland]] ([[Scotch thistle]]) and [[Wales]] ([[daffodil]]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Function-related passports====\nBesides the ordinary passports described above, special passports are issued to government officials from which diplomatic status may (diplomatic passport) or may not (official passport) be conferred by the text on the cover.

If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen'').

This applies usually to people who travel frequently on business, and may need to have a passport booklet to travel on while the other is awaiting a visa for another country. Some Muslim-majority countries including [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]] do not issue visas to visitors if their passports bear a stamp or visa issued by Israel, as a result of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]].

The present-day German Army was founded in 1955 as part of the newly formed West German ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' together with the [[German Navy|''Marine'']] (German Navy) and the [[German Air Force|''Luftwaffe'']] (German Air Force). {{asof|2019|12}}, the German Army had a strength of 63,555 soldiers.<ref name=\"bundeswehr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/ueber-die-bundeswehr/zahlen-daten-fakten/personalzahlen-bundeswehr|title=Aktuelle Personalzahlen der Bundeswehr [Current personnel numbers of the Federal Defence]|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Bundeswehr}}\n\n===Overview===\nA German army equipped, organized, and trained following a single doctrine and permanently unified under one command in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]] under the leadership of [[Prussia]]. From 1871 to 1919, the title ''[[German Army (German Empire)|Deutsches Heer]]'' (German Army) was the official name of the German land forces. Following the German defeat in [[World War I]] and the end of the [[German Empire]], the main army was dissolved. From 1921 to 1935 the name of the German land forces was the ''[[Reichswehr|Reichsheer]]'' (Army of the Realm) and from 1935 to 1945 the name ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' was used. The ''Heer'' was one of two ground forces of the Third Reich during [[World War II]] but, unlike the ''Heer'', the [[Waffen-SS]] was not a branch of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' but was a combat force under the [[Nazi Party]]'s own ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' forces. The ''Heer'' was formally disbanded in August 1946.<ref>Large, David Clay (1996). ''Germans to the Front: West German Rearmament in the Adenauer Era'', p. 25</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was split into two sovereign states and both formed their own militaries: on 12 November 1955 the first recruits began their service in the West German ''Heer'', while on 1 March 1956 the East German ''[[Land Forces of the National People's Army|Landstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA]]'' (Land Forces of the National People's Army) were founded. During the Cold War, the West German Army was fully integrated into [[NATO]]s command structure while the ''Landstreitkr\u00e4fte'' were part of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, the ''Landstreitkr\u00e4fte'' were partially integrated into the German Army. Since then, the German Army has been employed in peacekeeping operations worldwide and since 2002 also in combat operations in Afghanistan as part of NATO's [[International Security Assistance Force]].\n\n===Founding of the Army===\n{{See also|Cold War tank formations}}\n[[File:Bundeswehrsoldaten w\u00e4hrend eines Man\u00f6vers (1960).jpg|thumb|left|''Bundeswehr'' soldiers with [[MG3|MG1]] and [[HK G3]] during a 1960s maneuver. In the background is a [[Sch\u00fctzenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz|Sch\u00fctzenpanzer Kurz]].]]\n\nFollowing World War II the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dissolved the ''Wehrmacht'' with all its branches on 20 August 1946. However already one year after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 and because of its increasing links with the West under German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], the Consultative Assembly of [[Europe]] began to consider the formation of a [[European Defence Community]] with German participation on 11 August 1950. Former high-ranking ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' officers outlined in the [[Himmerod memorandum|Himmeroder memorandum]] a plan for a \"German contingent in an international force for the defense of Western Europe.\" For the German land forces the memorandum envisioned the formation of a 250,000 strong army. The officers saw the need for the formation of twelve [[Panzer division]]s and six corps staffs with accompanying Corps troops, as only armored divisions could muster a fighting force to throw back the numerically far superior forces of the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=Abenheim5 />\n\nOn 26 October 1950 [[Theodor Blank]] was appointed \"officer of the Federal Chancellor for the Strengthening of Allied Troops questions\". This [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence Ministry]] forerunner was known somewhat euphemistically as the Blank Office ([[Amt Blank]]), but explicitly used to prepare for the [[Wiederbewaffnung|rearmament]] of West Germany (''[[Wiederbewaffnung]]'').<ref>See Frederick Zilian Jr., 'From Confrontation to Cooperation: The Takeover of the National People's (East German) Army by the Bundeswehr,' Praeger, Westport, Conn., 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96546-5}}, p.40\u201341, for a discussion of this period</ref> By March 1954 the Blank Office had finished plans for a new German army. Plans foresaw the formation of six infantry, four armoured, and two mechanised infantry divisions, as the German contribution to the defense of Western Europe in the framework of a [[European Defence Community]].<ref name=Abenheim5>For a discussion on German defence planning in the context of the EDC, see Abenheim, ''Reforging the Iron Cross,'' Chap. 5 (Zilian, p.41)</ref> On 8 February 1952 the Bundestag approved a German contribution to the defense of Western Europe and on 26 February 1954 the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the Republic was amended with the insertion of an article regarding the defence of the sovereignty of the federal government.<ref name=\"Zilian, p.41\">Zilian, p.41</ref> Following a decision at the [[London and Paris Conferences|London Nine Power Conference]] of 28 September to 3 October 1954, Germany's entry into [[NATO]] effective from 9 May 1955 was accepted as a replacement for the failed European Defence Community plan. Afterwards the Blank Office was converted to the Defence Ministry and Theodor Blank became the first Defence Minister. The nucleus of army was the so-called ''V'' Branch of the Department of Defence. Subdivisions included were ''VA Leadership and Training,'' ''VB Organisation'' and ''VC Logistics.''\n\nThe army saw itself explicitly not as a successor to the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', but as in the traditions of the [[Prussian reforms#Military|Prussian military reformers]] of 1807 to 1814 and the members of the [[German resistance|military resistance]] during National Socialism; such as the officers which undertook the failed [[20 July plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1944. Nevertheless, for lack of alternatives the officer corps was made up largely of former ''Wehrmacht'' officers. The first Chief of the Army was the former ''Wehrmacht'' [[General der Panzertruppe|''General der Panzertruppe'']] [[Hans Rottiger]], who had been involved in the drafting of the Himmeroder memorandum.\n\nThe official date of the founding of the army is 12 November 1955 when the first soldiers began their service in [[Andernach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/23/50_Jahre_BuWe|title=Bundeswehr: Adenauers Geheimnis|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany|date=2 June 2005|work=ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate=19 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071339/http://www.zeit.de/2005/23/50_Jahre_BuWe|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1956 the first troops set up seven training companies in Andernach and began the formation of schools and training centers. On 1 April 1957, the first conscripts arrived for service in the army. The first military organisations created were instructional battalions, officer schools, and the Army Academy, the forerunner to the [[F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr|''F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr'']] in [[Hamburg]].<ref name=\"Zilian, p.41\"/> In total of twelve armoured and infantry divisions were to be established by 1959, as planned in Army Structure I. To achieve this goal existing units were split approximately every six months. However the creation of all twelve divisions did not take place until 1965. At the end of 1958 the strength of the army was about 100,000 men. The army was equipped at first with American material, such as the [[M-47 Patton]] main battle tank. Three corps commands were formed beginning in 1957: the I Corps, II Corps, and the [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III Corps]].\n\nAlso in 1957 the \"Office for Territorial Defence\" was established as the highest Territorial Army authority. The Office for Territorial Defence was under the direct command of the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and commanded the [[Territorial Army (Germany)]] (''Territorialheer''), a reserve formation. While the ''Heer'' along with the ''[[German Navy|Marine]]'' and ''[[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]]'' were firmly integrated into the NATO Military Command Structure, the ''Territorialheer'' remained under national command. The main function of the ''Territorialheer'' was to maintain the operational freedom of NATO forces through providing rear area defence against saboteurs, enemy special forces, and the like. There were three Territorial Commands (''Territorialkommandos''), including North, [[:de:Territorialkommando Sud|South]], and [[:de:Territorialkommando Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]], and up to six [[:de:Wehrbereichskommando|''Wehrbereichskommandos'']] (WBKs), military regional commands.<ref>Isby and Kamps 1985, 228-229.</ref> By 1985 each of the WBKs had two ''Heimatschutzbrigades'' (HSBs, home defence brigades).\n[[File:West German Bundeswehr 1960.jpg|thumb|[[M47 Patton]] tank in service with the ''Bundeswehr'', 1960]]\n\nThe development of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons required the development of a new Army structure even before Army Structure I was fully achieved. To minimize the effects of attacks with tactical nuclear weapons on massed forces, the 28,000 strong [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the ''Heer'' were broken up into smaller and more mobile [[brigade]]s. These smaller units were also to be capable of self-sustainment on an atomic battlefield for several days, and to be capable of to move quickly from defense and to attack. The new armoured and mechanized brigades were capable of [[combined arms]] combat. Each division was composed of three brigades. The armoured brigades consisted of an armoured infantry battalion, two armoured battalions, an armoured artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The mechanized brigades consisted of a motorized infantry battalion, two mechanized infantry battalions, an armored battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The motorized brigades consisted of three motorized infantry battalions, an anti-tank battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The alpine brigades consisted of three alpine battalions, a mountain artillery battalion and a supply battalion. By 1959 the ''Heer'' consisted of 11 divisions of 27 brigades, four ''Panzer'' (armoured), four ''Panzergrenadier'' (mechanized), two ''J\u00e4ger'' (motorized), and one ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' (alpine).\n\nAt the end of the Cold War the German Army fielded 12 divisions with 38 brigades: six ''Panzer'' (armoured), four ''Panzergrenadier'' (mechanized), one ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' (airborne), and one ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' (alpine) division. Nine divisions were grouped into three corps: [[NORTHAG wartime structure in 1989#I German Corps|I German Corps]] as part of NATO's [[Northern Army Group]], II German Corps and [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III German Corps]] as part of [[Allied Force Command Heidelberg|Central Army Group]]. The remaining three divisions were part of [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches]] ([[6th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|6th Panzergrenadier Division]]) and NORTHAG's [[NORTHAG wartime structure in 1989#I Netherlands Corps|I Netherlands Corps]] ([[3rd Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|3rd Panzer Division]]), while the 1st ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division was assigned in peacetime to II German Corps and doubled as general staff for the [[ACE Mobile Force (Land)]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:DN-ST-92-02168.jpg|thumb|right|Helicopter of the [[German Army Aviation Corps]] in [[Iraq|Northern Iraq]] in 1991]]\nAfter 1990, the ''Heer'' absorbed the [[National People's Army|''Nationale Volksarmee'']], the armed forces of [[East Germany]]. The former East German forces were initially controlled by the ''Bundeswehr'' Command East under the command of Lieutenant General [[J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm]] and disbanded on 30 June 1991.<ref>See Jorg Schonbohm, 'Two Armies and One Fatherland', Berghahn Books, Providence & Oxford, 1996</ref> In the aftermath of the merger, the German Army consisted of four Corps (including IV Corps at [[Potsdam]] in the former DDR) with a manpower of 360,000 men. It was continuously downsized from this point. In 1994 [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III Corps]] was reorganised as the [[German Army Forces Command]]. In 1996, the 25th Airborne Brigade was converted into a new command leading the Army's special forces, known as the [[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte|''Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte'']].\n\nThe 2001 onwards restructuring of the German Army saw it move to a seven division structure \u2013 five mechanized (each with two mechanized brigades), one special forces, and one air assault.\n\nIn 2003, three Corps still existed, each including various combat formations and a maintenance brigade, as well as the [[I. German/Dutch Corps]], a joint German-Netherlands organization, used to control in peacetime the 1st Panzer and 7th Panzer Divisions as well as Dutch formations. The 1st Panzer would have reported to the corps in wartime while the 7th would be posted to the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. II Corps was German in peacetime but would have exchanged a division with the [[V Corps (United States)|V U.S. Corps]] in time of war (the [[5th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|5th Panzer]]). The 5th Panzer was formally Division disbanded as of 30 June 2001. In peacetime it also commanded the [[10th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|10th Panzer Division]], which was allocated to [[Eurocorps]] and which parents the German half of the [[Franco-German Brigade]]. The [[1st Mountain Division (Bundeswehr)|1st Mountain Division]] at Munich was also subordinate to this headquarters.\n\nThe IV Corps was headquartered at [[Potsdam]] in eastern Germany and controlled two Panzer-Grenadier Divisions, the [[13th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|13th]] and 14th. The [[14th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|14th Panzergrenadier Division]] also took control of units in Western Germany re-subordinated from the [[6th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|6th Panzergrenadier Division]] when it lost its command function. It would have made up the German contribution to the [[Multinational Corps Northeast]] in time of war. IV Corps also used to have under its command the Military District Command I, the [[1st Airmobile Brigade (Bundeswehr)|1st Airmobile Brigade]], and the Berlin Command ([[:de:Standortkommando Berlin]]).\n\n==German Army today ==\nAll corps have now been disbanded or transferred to a multinational level such as [[Multinational Corps North East]]. IV Corps was reorganized and on 31 March 2002 became an overseas deployment command, the ''Einsatzf\u00fchrungskommando der Bundeswehr'', like the British [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]]. An army reorganisation in recent years has seen the disbandment of the [[13th Mechanized Infantry Division (Germany)|13th Mechanized Infantry Division]] headquarters, a merge of the [[Airmobile Operations Division (Germany)|Airmobile Operations Division]] and [[Special Operations Division (Germany)|Special Operations Division]] headquarters, the disbandment of the 1st Airmobile Brigade, and reshuffling of units between divisions.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} No heavy brigades were disbanded, but the two remaining heavy divisions command three rather than two brigades.\n\n{{asof|2019|12}} there were a total of 63,555 soldiers on active service in the German Army.<ref name=\"bundeswehr\" /> However, the quite unique German military branch of the [[Joint Support Service (Germany)|Joint Support Service]] consists to a significant degree of ''Heeresuniformtr\u00e4ger'' (army uniform wearing personnel).<ref>[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/009/1800933.pdf German Bundestag - Annual Disarmament Report 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522104324/http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/009/1800933.pdf |date=2014-05-22 }}, bundestag.de, page 63</ref> This is also contributed to by the [[Joint Medical Service (Germany)|Joint Medical Service]], which does have other solely-military-medical branch counterparts (such as in South Africa).\n\nIn accordance with EU working hour regulations, the regular work-week is 41 hours, although numerous exceptions exist for e.g. deployments in oversea missions, training exercises, emergencies, and similar military needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/!ut/p/c4/NYs9D4JAEET_0S2XaAx0EBobEykEbMwBG9x4H2RdvMYf713hTPKaNwN3SPXmQ6sRCt5YGGCcqZqimuKCyrxkR2vxrSKSIONDnujQQ5-PaTAHj5Ip6IUSVzYSWG2BxWazMyejaIGx0G2jT8U_-lsfL9dbfyjL9tx0sDlX_wB8pnXq/|title=FAQ Arbeitszeitregelung|date=30 December 2015|work=Bundeswehr|accessdate=3 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514081451/http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/!ut/p/c4/NYs9D4JAEET_0S2XaAx0EBobEykEbMwBG9x4H2RdvMYf713hTPKaNwN3SPXmQ6sRCt5YGGCcqZqimuKCyrxkR2vxrSKSIONDnujQQ5-PaTAHj5Ip6IUSVzYSWG2BxWazMyejaIGx0G2jT8U_-lsfL9dbfyjL9tx0sDlX_wB8pnXq|archive-date=14 May 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Modern equipment===\n{{Main|List of modern equipment of the German Army}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Leopard 2A6, PzBtl 104.jpg|[[Leopard 2A6]] main battle tank\nFile:PzH2000 houwitser.png|[[Panzerhaubitze 2000|PzH2000]] self-propelled artillery\nFile:Tag der Bundeswehr NH90 (cropped).jpg|[[NHIndustries NH90|NH-90]] transport helicopter\nFile:Puma, first series.jpg|[[Puma (IFV)|Puma]] infantry fighting vehicle\n</gallery>\n\nFurther vehicles include:\n\nArmoured personnel carrier and fighting vehicles:\n*[[Puma (IFV)]] battle tank and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]\n*[[Boxer (armoured fighting vehicle)]]\n*[[TPz Fuchs]] as [[armoured personnel carrier]]\n*[[ATF Dingo]] as armoured [[infantry mobility vehicle]]\n\nTrucks:\n*[[Mercedes-Benz Zetros]] off-road transport truck\n*[[MAN KAT1]] high-mobility off-road truck\n*[[Unimog]] all-wheel drive army personnel or equipment carriers\n\n==Structure and organisation==\n{{Main|Structure of the German Army}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Germany\n| width = 420\n| float = right\n| caption = <center>Locations of the German Army's major units:<br> [[File:DeepPink pog.svg|10px]] [[Armoured warfare|Armoured]] [[File:Pink pog.svg|10px]] [[Mechanized Infantry|Mechanized]] [[File:Blue 0080ff pog.svg|10px]] [[Armoured warfare|Airborne]] <br> [[File:Green pog.svg|10px]] [[Infantry]] [[File:Green 008000 pog.svg|10px]] [[Mountain Infantry]] [[File:Lightgreen pog.svg|10px]] [[Special Forces]]</center>\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n{{Location map~| Germany\n  | label = [[1st Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|1.

The present-day German Army was founded in 1955 as part of the newly formed West German ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' together with the [[German Navy|''Marine'']] (German Navy) and the [[German Air Force|''Luftwaffe'']] (German Air Force). {{asof|2019|12}}, the German Army had a strength of 63,555 soldiers.<ref name=\"bundeswehr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/ueber-die-bundeswehr/zahlen-daten-fakten/personalzahlen-bundeswehr|title=Aktuelle Personalzahlen der Bundeswehr [Current personnel numbers of the Federal Defence]|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Bundeswehr}}\n\n===Overview===\nA German army equipped, organized, and trained following a single doctrine and permanently unified under one command in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]] under the leadership of [[Prussia]]. From 1871 to 1919, the title ''[[German Army (German Empire)|Deutsches Heer]]'' (German Army) was the official name of the German land forces. Following the German defeat in [[World War I]] and the end of the [[German Empire]], the main army was dissolved. From 1921 to 1935 the name of the German land forces was the ''[[Reichswehr|Reichsheer]]'' (Army of the Realm) and from 1935 to 1945 the name ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' was used. The ''Heer'' was one of two ground forces of the Third Reich during [[World War II]] but, unlike the ''Heer'', the [[Waffen-SS]] was not a branch of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' but was a combat force under the [[Nazi Party]]'s own ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' forces. The ''Heer'' was formally disbanded in August 1946.<ref>Large, David Clay (1996). ''Germans to the Front: West German Rearmament in the Adenauer Era'', p. 25</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was split into two sovereign states and both formed their own militaries: on 12 November 1955 the first recruits began their service in the West German ''Heer'', while on 1 March 1956 the East German ''[[Land Forces of the National People's Army|Landstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA]]'' (Land Forces of the National People's Army) were founded. During the Cold War, the West German Army was fully integrated into [[NATO]]s command structure while the ''Landstreitkr\u00e4fte'' were part of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, the ''Landstreitkr\u00e4fte'' were partially integrated into the German Army. Since then, the German Army has been employed in peacekeeping operations worldwide and since 2002 also in combat operations in Afghanistan as part of NATO's [[International Security Assistance Force]].\n\n===Founding of the Army===\n{{See also|Cold War tank formations}}\n[[File:Bundeswehrsoldaten w\u00e4hrend eines Man\u00f6vers (1960).jpg|thumb|left|''Bundeswehr'' soldiers with [[MG3|MG1]] and [[HK G3]] during a 1960s maneuver. In the background is a [[Sch\u00fctzenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz|Sch\u00fctzenpanzer Kurz]].]]\n\nFollowing World War II the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dissolved the ''Wehrmacht'' with all its branches on 20 August 1946. However already one year after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 and because of its increasing links with the West under German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], the Consultative Assembly of [[Europe]] began to consider the formation of a [[European Defence Community]] with German participation on 11 August 1950. Former high-ranking ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' officers outlined in the [[Himmerod memorandum|Himmeroder memorandum]] a plan for a \"German contingent in an international force for the defense of Western Europe.\" For the German land forces the memorandum envisioned the formation of a 250,000 strong army. The officers saw the need for the formation of twelve [[Panzer division]]s and six corps staffs with accompanying Corps troops, as only armored divisions could muster a fighting force to throw back the numerically far superior forces of the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=Abenheim5 />\n\nOn 26 October 1950 [[Theodor Blank]] was appointed \"officer of the Federal Chancellor for the Strengthening of Allied Troops questions\". This [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence Ministry]] forerunner was known somewhat euphemistically as the Blank Office ([[Amt Blank]]), but explicitly used to prepare for the [[Wiederbewaffnung|rearmament]] of West Germany (''[[Wiederbewaffnung]]'').<ref>See Frederick Zilian Jr., 'From Confrontation to Cooperation: The Takeover of the National People's (East German) Army by the Bundeswehr,' Praeger, Westport, Conn., 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96546-5}}, p.40\u201341, for a discussion of this period</ref> By March 1954 the Blank Office had finished plans for a new German army. Plans foresaw the formation of six infantry, four armoured, and two mechanised infantry divisions, as the German contribution to the defense of Western Europe in the framework of a [[European Defence Community]].<ref name=Abenheim5>For a discussion on German defence planning in the context of the EDC, see Abenheim, ''Reforging the Iron Cross,'' Chap. 5 (Zilian, p.41)</ref> On 8 February 1952 the Bundestag approved a German contribution to the defense of Western Europe and on 26 February 1954 the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the Republic was amended with the insertion of an article regarding the defence of the sovereignty of the federal government.<ref name=\"Zilian, p.41\">Zilian, p.41</ref> Following a decision at the [[London and Paris Conferences|London Nine Power Conference]] of 28 September to 3 October 1954, Germany's entry into [[NATO]] effective from 9 May 1955 was accepted as a replacement for the failed European Defence Community plan. Afterwards the Blank Office was converted to the Defence Ministry and Theodor Blank became the first Defence Minister. The nucleus of army was the so-called ''V'' Branch of the Department of Defence. Subdivisions included were ''VA Leadership and Training,'' ''VB Organisation'' and ''VC Logistics.''\n\nThe army saw itself explicitly not as a successor to the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', but as in the traditions of the [[Prussian reforms#Military|Prussian military reformers]] of 1807 to 1814 and the members of the [[German resistance|military resistance]] during National Socialism; such as the officers which undertook the failed [[20 July plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1944. Nevertheless, for lack of alternatives the officer corps was made up largely of former ''Wehrmacht'' officers. The first Chief of the Army was the former ''Wehrmacht'' [[General der Panzertruppe|''General der Panzertruppe'']] [[Hans Rottiger]], who had been involved in the drafting of the Himmeroder memorandum.\n\nThe official date of the founding of the army is 12 November 1955 when the first soldiers began their service in [[Andernach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/23/50_Jahre_BuWe|title=Bundeswehr: Adenauers Geheimnis|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany|date=2 June 2005|work=ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate=19 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071339/http://www.zeit.de/2005/23/50_Jahre_BuWe|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1956 the first troops set up seven training companies in Andernach and began the formation of schools and training centers. On 1 April 1957, the first conscripts arrived for service in the army. The first military organisations created were instructional battalions, officer schools, and the Army Academy, the forerunner to the [[F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr|''F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr'']] in [[Hamburg]].<ref name=\"Zilian, p.41\"/> In total of twelve armoured and infantry divisions were to be established by 1959, as planned in Army Structure I. To achieve this goal existing units were split approximately every six months. However the creation of all twelve divisions did not take place until 1965. At the end of 1958 the strength of the army was about 100,000 men. The army was equipped at first with American material, such as the [[M-47 Patton]] main battle tank. Three corps commands were formed beginning in 1957: the I Corps, II Corps, and the [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III Corps]].\n\nAlso in 1957 the \"Office for Territorial Defence\" was established as the highest Territorial Army authority. The Office for Territorial Defence was under the direct command of the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and commanded the [[Territorial Army (Germany)]] (''Territorialheer''), a reserve formation. While the ''Heer'' along with the ''[[German Navy|Marine]]'' and ''[[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]]'' were firmly integrated into the NATO Military Command Structure, the ''Territorialheer'' remained under national command. The main function of the ''Territorialheer'' was to maintain the operational freedom of NATO forces through providing rear area defence against saboteurs, enemy special forces, and the like. There were three Territorial Commands (''Territorialkommandos''), including North, [[:de:Territorialkommando Sud|South]], and [[:de:Territorialkommando Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]], and up to six [[:de:Wehrbereichskommando|''Wehrbereichskommandos'']] (WBKs), military regional commands.<ref>Isby and Kamps 1985, 228-229.</ref> By 1985 each of the WBKs had two ''Heimatschutzbrigades'' (HSBs, home defence brigades).\n[[File:West German Bundeswehr 1960.jpg|thumb|[[M47 Patton]] tank in service with the ''Bundeswehr'', 1960]]\n\nThe development of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons required the development of a new Army structure even before Army Structure I was fully achieved. To minimize the effects of attacks with tactical nuclear weapons on massed forces, the 28,000 strong [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the ''Heer'' were broken up into smaller and more mobile [[brigade]]s. These smaller units were also to be capable of self-sustainment on an atomic battlefield for several days, and to be capable of to move quickly from defense and to attack. The new armoured and mechanized brigades were capable of [[combined arms]] combat. Each division was composed of three brigades. The armoured brigades consisted of an armoured infantry battalion, two armoured battalions, an armoured artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The mechanized brigades consisted of a motorized infantry battalion, two mechanized infantry battalions, an armored battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The motorized brigades consisted of three motorized infantry battalions, an anti-tank battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The alpine brigades consisted of three alpine battalions, a mountain artillery battalion and a supply battalion. By 1959 the ''Heer'' consisted of 11 divisions of 27 brigades, four ''Panzer'' (armoured), four ''Panzergrenadier'' (mechanized), two ''J\u00e4ger'' (motorized), and one ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' (alpine).\n\nAt the end of the Cold War the German Army fielded 12 divisions with 38 brigades: six ''Panzer'' (armoured), four ''Panzergrenadier'' (mechanized), one ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' (airborne), and one ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' (alpine) division. Nine divisions were grouped into three corps: [[NORTHAG wartime structure in 1989#I German Corps|I German Corps]] as part of NATO's [[Northern Army Group]], II German Corps and [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III German Corps]] as part of [[Allied Force Command Heidelberg|Central Army Group]]. The remaining three divisions were part of [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches]] ([[6th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|6th Panzergrenadier Division]]) and NORTHAG's [[NORTHAG wartime structure in 1989#I Netherlands Corps|I Netherlands Corps]] ([[3rd Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|3rd Panzer Division]]), while the 1st ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' Division was assigned in peacetime to II German Corps and doubled as general staff for the [[ACE Mobile Force (Land)]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:DN-ST-92-02168.jpg|thumb|right|Helicopter of the [[German Army Aviation Corps]] in [[Iraq|Northern Iraq]] in 1991]]\nAfter 1990, the ''Heer'' absorbed the [[National People's Army|''Nationale Volksarmee'']], the armed forces of [[East Germany]]. The former East German forces were initially controlled by the ''Bundeswehr'' Command East under the command of Lieutenant General [[J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm]] and disbanded on 30 June 1991.<ref>See Jorg Schonbohm, 'Two Armies and One Fatherland', Berghahn Books, Providence & Oxford, 1996</ref> In the aftermath of the merger, the German Army consisted of four Corps (including IV Corps at [[Potsdam]] in the former DDR) with a manpower of 360,000 men. It was continuously downsized from this point. In 1994 [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|III Corps]] was reorganised as the [[German Army Forces Command]]. In 1996, the 25th Airborne Brigade was converted into a new command leading the Army's special forces, known as the [[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte|''Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte'']].\n\nThe 2001 onwards restructuring of the German Army saw it move to a seven division structure \u2013 five mechanized (each with two mechanized brigades), one special forces, and one air assault.\n\nIn 2003, three Corps still existed, each including various combat formations and a maintenance brigade, as well as the [[I. German/Dutch Corps]], a joint German-Netherlands organization, used to control in peacetime the 1st Panzer and 7th Panzer Divisions as well as Dutch formations. The 1st Panzer would have reported to the corps in wartime while the 7th would be posted to the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. II Corps was German in peacetime but would have exchanged a division with the [[V Corps (United States)|V U.S. Corps]] in time of war (the [[5th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|5th Panzer]]). The 5th Panzer was formally Division disbanded as of 30 June 2001. In peacetime it also commanded the [[10th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)|10th Panzer Division]], which was allocated to [[Eurocorps]] and which parents the German half of the [[Franco-German Brigade]]. The [[1st Mountain Division (Bundeswehr)|1st Mountain Division]] at Munich was also subordinate to this headquarters.\n\nThe IV Corps was headquartered at [[Potsdam]] in eastern Germany and controlled two Panzer-Grenadier Divisions, the [[13th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|13th]] and 14th. The [[14th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|14th Panzergrenadier Division]] also took control of units in Western Germany re-subordinated from the [[6th Panzergrenadier Division (Bundeswehr)|6th Panzergrenadier Division]] when it lost its command function. It would have made up the German contribution to the [[Multinational Corps Northeast]] in time of war. IV Corps also used to have under its command the Military District Command I, the [[1st Airmobile Brigade (Bundeswehr)|1st Airmobile Brigade]], and the Berlin Command ([[:de:Standortkommando Berlin]]).\n\n==German Army today ==\nAll corps have now been disbanded or transferred to a multinational level such as [[Multinational Corps North East]].

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\"&nbsp;''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\" ''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|alt=Map of northeast and southeastern Thailand showing the distribution of Cretaceous geological strata | Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

He successively owned clothing stores in Des Moines, in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], and in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]], but the family's resources were limited. Hyman attended public schools in Fort Dodge. At home she was required to do much of the housework. She enjoyed reading, especially books by [[Charles Dickens]] in her father's small den, and she took a strong interest in [[flower]]s, which she learned to classify with a copy of [[Asa Gray]]'s ''[[Elements of Botany]]''. She also collected butterflies and moths and later wrote, \"I believe my interest in nature is primarily aesthetic.\"<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\nHyman graduated from high school in Fort Dodge in 1905 as the youngest member of her class and the valedictorian. Uncertain of her future, she began work in a local factory, pasting labels on cereal boxes. Her high school teacher of [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] persuaded her to attend the [[University of Chicago]], which she entered in 1906 on a one-year scholarship. She continued at the university with further scholarships and nominal jobs. Turning away from botany because of an unpleasant laboratory assistant, she tried chemistry but did not like its quantitative procedures.<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" /> She then took zoology and was encouraged in it by Professor [[Charles Manning Child]]. After receiving a B.S. in [[zoology]] in 1910, she acted on Child's advice to continue with graduate work at the University of Chicago. \nSupporting herself as laboratory assistant in various zoology courses, she concluded that a better laboratory text was needed, which in time she was to supply. \nShe received a Ph.D. in zoology in 1915, with a thesis on regeneration in certain annelid worms. Again unsure of her future, she accepted a position as research assistant in Child's laboratory, and she taught undergraduate courses in comparative anatomy.\n\nAfter Hyman's father's death in 1907, her mother had moved to [[Chicago]], bringing Hyman \"back into the same unhappy circumstances which lasted until the death of my mother in 1929. I never received any encouragement from my family to continue my academic career; in fact my determination to attend the University met with derision. At home, scolding and fault-finding were my daily portion\" (quoted in Hutchinson, p.&nbsp;106).<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\n==Work==\nAt the request of the University of Chicago Press, Hyman wrote ''A Laboratory Manual for Elementary Zoology'' (1919),<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\">{{cite web | last=Hyman | first=Libbie Henrietta | title=A Laboratory Manual for Elementary Zo\u00f6logy : Libbie Henrietta Hyman : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive | website=Internet Archive | date=1919 | url=https://archive.org/details/alaboratorymanu00hymagoog | accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> which promptly became widely used, to her astonishment. She followed this, again at the publisher's request, with ''[[A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]]'' (1922),<ref name=\"Hyman 1922\">{{cite web | last=Hyman | first=Libbie Henrietta | title=A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy : Libbie Henrietta Hyman : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive | website=Internet Archive | date=1922 | url=https://archive.org/details/ost-biology-labmanualcompvert00hymarich | accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> which also had great success. She was, however, much more interested in [[invertebrate]]s. By 1925 she was considering how to prepare a laboratory guide in that field but \"was persuaded by [unnamed] colleagues to write an advanced text\" (quoted in Hutchinson, p.&nbsp;107).<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\nWhile at the University of Chicago, Hyman also wrote taxonomic papers on such invertebrates as the [[Turbellaria]] (flatworms) and North American species of the freshwater cnidarian ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]''. She published an enlarged edition of her first laboratory manual in 1929.\n\nIn 1931, Hyman concluded that she could live on the royalties of her published books, and she also recognized that her mentor Child was about to retire. She therefore resigned her position at Chicago. Hyman toured western Europe for fifteen months and then returned to begin writing a treatise on the invertebrates. Settling in [[New York City]] in order to use the library of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], she became, in December 1936, an unpaid research associate of the museum, which provided her with an office for the rest of her life.\n\nThere Hyman created her six-volume treatise on invertebrates, ''The Invertebrates'', drawing on her familiarity with several European languages and [[Russian language|Russian]], which she had learned from her father.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hyman-libbie.pdf|title= Libbie Henrietta Hyman | journal =Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 60| issue = 5230| pages =103\u2013114|bibcode= 1970Natur.225..393. |year= 1970 |doi= 10.1038/225393a0 }}</ref> She compiled notes from books and scientific papers, including those in the many journals to which she subscribed, organized the notes on cards, and wrote an account of each invertebrate group. She took art lessons in order to illustrate her work professionally. She also spent several summers studying specimens and drawing illustrations at Bermuda Biological Laboratory, [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, and Puget Sound Biological Station.\n\nVolume I (Protozoa through Ctenophora) of ''The Invertebrates'', published in February 1940, was acknowledged{{by whom|date=June 2018}} as \"comprehensive\" and \"authoritative,\" with \"illustrations designed for clarity and simplicity.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Volume 2 (Platyhelminthes and Rhynchocoela) and Volume 3 (Acanthocephala, Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta), both published in 1951, were followed by Volume 4 (Echinodermata) in 1955, Volume 5 (Smaller Coelomate Groups) in 1959, and Volume 6 (Mollusca I) in 1967. Hyman's biographer [[Horace Wesley Stunkard]] noted that ''The Invertebrates'' \"incorporates incisive analysis, judicious evaluation and masterly integration of information.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Declining health did not allow her to finish the entire subject.\n\nIn it she developed her scientific theory that the [[Phylum]] [[Chordata]], including all [[vertebrate]]s, was evolutionarily related to the apparently very different and very much more primitive [[Echinoderm]]ata, such as [[starfish]].<ref name=\"antique\">[http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1226840585&l=en&searchform= The Invertebrates: Echinodermata.

Her theory was based upon the morphological data of classical embryology, and has since been confirmed by molecular [[sequence analysis]].<ref name=\"antique\"/>\n\nIn addition to her major project, Hyman extensively revised ''[[A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]]'' in 1942 into a textbook as well as laboratory manual; she referred to it as her \"bread and butter\" for its income.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} She wrote about 136 papers on physiology and systematics of the lower invertebrates and published technical papers on annelid and polyclad worms and on other invertebrates. She commented in a letter: \"The polyclads of [[Bermuda]] were so pretty that I could not resist collecting them and figuring out Verrill's mistakes\" (quoted in Schram, p.&nbsp;126). [[Addison Emery Verrill]] had been an earlier expert in invertebrate classification.\n\nHyman served as editor of the journal ''[[Systematic Zoology]]'' from 1959 to 1963.

He successively owned clothing stores in Des Moines, in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], and in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]], but the family's resources were limited. Hyman attended public schools in Fort Dodge. At home she was required to do much of the housework. She enjoyed reading, especially books by [[Charles Dickens]] in her father's small den, and she took a strong interest in [[flower]]s, which she learned to classify with a copy of [[Asa Gray]]'s ''[[Elements of Botany]]''. She also collected butterflies and moths and later wrote, \"I believe my interest in nature is primarily aesthetic.\"<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\nHyman graduated from high school in Fort Dodge in 1905 as the youngest member of her class and the valedictorian. Uncertain of her future, she began work in a local factory, pasting labels on cereal boxes. Her high school teacher of [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] persuaded her to attend the [[University of Chicago]], which she entered in 1906 on a one-year scholarship. She continued at the university with further scholarships and nominal jobs. Turning away from botany because of an unpleasant laboratory assistant, she tried chemistry but did not like its quantitative procedures.<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" /> She then took zoology and was encouraged in it by Professor [[Charles Manning Child]]. After receiving a B.S. in [[zoology]] in 1910, she acted on Child's advice to continue with graduate work at the University of Chicago. \nSupporting herself as laboratory assistant in various zoology courses, she concluded that a better laboratory text was needed, which in time she was to supply. \nShe received a Ph.D. in zoology in 1915, with a thesis on regeneration in certain annelid worms. Again unsure of her future, she accepted a position as research assistant in Child's laboratory, and she taught undergraduate courses in comparative anatomy.\n\nAfter Hyman's father's death in 1907, her mother had moved to [[Chicago]], bringing Hyman \"back into the same unhappy circumstances which lasted until the death of my mother in 1929. I never received any encouragement from my family to continue my academic career; in fact my determination to attend the University met with derision. At home, scolding and fault-finding were my daily portion\" (quoted in Hutchinson, p.&nbsp;106).<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\n==Work==\nAt the request of the University of Chicago Press, Hyman wrote ''A Laboratory Manual for Elementary Zoology'' (1919),<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\">{{cite web | last=Hyman | first=Libbie Henrietta | title=A Laboratory Manual for Elementary Zo\u00f6logy : Libbie Henrietta Hyman : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive | website=Internet Archive | date=1919 | url=https://archive.org/details/alaboratorymanu00hymagoog | accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> which promptly became widely used, to her astonishment. She followed this, again at the publisher's request, with ''[[A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]]'' (1922),<ref name=\"Hyman 1922\">{{cite web | last=Hyman | first=Libbie Henrietta | title=A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy : Libbie Henrietta Hyman : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive | website=Internet Archive | date=1922 | url=https://archive.org/details/ost-biology-labmanualcompvert00hymarich | accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> which also had great success. She was, however, much more interested in [[invertebrate]]s. By 1925 she was considering how to prepare a laboratory guide in that field but \"was persuaded by [unnamed] colleagues to write an advanced text\" (quoted in Hutchinson, p.&nbsp;107).<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\nWhile at the University of Chicago, Hyman also wrote taxonomic papers on such invertebrates as the [[Turbellaria]] (flatworms) and North American species of the freshwater cnidarian ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]''. She published an enlarged edition of her first laboratory manual in 1929.\n\nIn 1931, Hyman concluded that she could live on the royalties of her published books, and she also recognized that her mentor Child was about to retire. She therefore resigned her position at Chicago. Hyman toured western Europe for fifteen months and then returned to begin writing a treatise on the invertebrates. Settling in [[New York City]] in order to use the library of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], she became, in December 1936, an unpaid research associate of the museum, which provided her with an office for the rest of her life.\n\nThere Hyman created her six-volume treatise on invertebrates, ''The Invertebrates'', drawing on her familiarity with several European languages and [[Russian language|Russian]], which she had learned from her father.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hyman-libbie.pdf|title= Libbie Henrietta Hyman | journal =Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 60| issue = 5230| pages =103\u2013114|bibcode= 1970Natur.225..393. |year= 1970 |doi= 10.1038/225393a0 }}</ref> She compiled notes from books and scientific papers, including those in the many journals to which she subscribed, organized the notes on cards, and wrote an account of each invertebrate group. She took art lessons in order to illustrate her work professionally. She also spent several summers studying specimens and drawing illustrations at Bermuda Biological Laboratory, [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, and Puget Sound Biological Station.\n\nVolume I (Protozoa through Ctenophora) of ''The Invertebrates'', published in February 1940, was acknowledged{{by whom|date=June 2018}} as \"comprehensive\" and \"authoritative,\" with \"illustrations designed for clarity and simplicity.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Volume 2 (Platyhelminthes and Rhynchocoela) and Volume 3 (Acanthocephala, Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta), both published in 1951, were followed by Volume 4 (Echinodermata) in 1955, Volume 5 (Smaller Coelomate Groups) in 1959, and Volume 6 (Mollusca I) in 1967. Hyman's biographer [[Horace Wesley Stunkard]] noted that ''The Invertebrates'' \"incorporates incisive analysis, judicious evaluation and masterly integration of information.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Declining health did not allow her to finish the entire subject.\n\nIn it she developed her scientific theory that the [[Phylum]] [[Chordata]], including all [[vertebrate]]s, was evolutionarily related to the apparently very different and very much more primitive [[Echinoderm]]ata, such as [[starfish]].<ref name=\"antique\">[http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1226840585&l=en&searchform= The Invertebrates: Echinodermata. The Coelomate Bilateria. Volume IV.]</ref> This group is now known as the  [[deuterostomes]]. Her theory was based upon the morphological data of classical embryology, and has since been confirmed by molecular [[sequence analysis]].<ref name=\"antique\"/>\n\nIn addition to her major project, Hyman extensively revised ''[[A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]]'' in 1942 into a textbook as well as laboratory manual; she referred to it as her \"bread and butter\" for its income.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} She wrote about 136 papers on physiology and systematics of the lower invertebrates and published technical papers on annelid and polyclad worms and on other invertebrates. She commented in a letter: \"The polyclads of [[Bermuda]] were so pretty that I could not resist collecting them and figuring out Verrill's mistakes\" (quoted in Schram, p.&nbsp;126). [[Addison Emery Verrill]] had been an earlier expert in invertebrate classification.\n\nHyman served as editor of the journal ''[[Systematic Zoology]]'' from 1959 to 1963. In 1960, she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> She was honored in 1961 with membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], from which she had received the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] in 1951.<ref name=Elliot>{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=15 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801121352/http://nas.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |archivedate=August 1, 2012 }}</ref> She also received the gold medal of the [[Linnean Society of London]] (1960) and a gold medal from the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (1969).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1206/novi|title=American Museum Novitates|publisher=American Museum of Natural History (BioOne sponsored)}}</ref> She died after suffering from Parkinson's disease in New York City.<ref name=\"Hyman 1919\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite journal\n|last=Jenner\n|first=Ronald A\n|authorlink=\n|date=September 2004|title=Libbie Henrietta Hyman (1888-1969): from developmental mechanics to the evolution of animal body plans\n|journal=[[J.
