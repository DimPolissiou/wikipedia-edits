As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref name=\"Maine1\" /> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref name=\"Maine1\" /> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album.

Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] and [[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women. The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, and is currenty the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording. Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] and [[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me. I just wanted to be like, 'Hey, guess what? I\u2019m back! Here are some songs. Want to listen to the music, huh? Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

For local government purposes it is also in the [[unitary authority]] of [[Medway]]. The town includes the settlements of [[Brompton, Medway|Brompton]], [[Hempstead, Kent|Hempstead]], [[Wigmore, Kent|Wigmore]], Parkwood, [[Rainham, Medway|Rainham]] which has its own significant retail and leisure hub, Rainham Mark and [[Twydall]].<!-- and [[Lidsing]] is not but used to be in the old Parish of Gillingham -->\n\nGillingham means a \"homestead of Gylla's family\", from [[Old English]] ''ham'' (\"village, homestead\") and ''ingas'' (\"family, followers\"), and was first recorded in the 10th century as ''Gyllingeham''.<ref>Also referred to in old texts as ''Jillyingham Water''.</ref> The town's name is pronounced with a soft 'g', compared to the hard 'g' used for [[Gillingham, Dorset]].\n\n==Status==\nGillingham became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], gaining [[municipal borough]] status in 1903.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Peter|title=Gillingham \u2013 from Rural District to Unitary Authority|url=http://gillinghamcorps.info/history.htm|website=The Salvation Army Gillingham Corps|accessdate=27 September 2015|date=2011}}</ref> John Robert Featherby was the first mayor of the Borough of Gillingham.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Featherby Family Tomb|url=http://www.historicmedway.co.uk/gillingham/st_mary_magdalene_grave_featherby.htm|website=Historic Medway|accessdate=27 September 2015|date=18 June 2012}}</ref> In 1928 [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] was added to the Gillingham Borough. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] it became a [[non-metropolitan district]]. It merged with the other Medway Towns (in the [[City of Rochester-upon-Medway]] district) in 1998 under the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|1990s UK local government reform]], to become part of the [[Medway]] unitary authority.\n\n===Town hall===\nThe Municipal Buildings in Canterbury Street were built as council offices for Gillingham Borough Council. They were opened by the Lord [[Mayor of London]], Sir [[George Broadbridge]], on 25 September 1937. The Lord Mayor was received at [[Gillingham Railway Station (Kent)|Gillingham Railway Station]] by a [[guard of honour]] of boys of [[HMS Arethusa (26)|HMS ''Arethusa'']]. Before the Second World War, air raid sirens were placed on the Municipal Buildings, and the local [[Civil Defence]] headquarters were in a single-storey building, to the rear of the car park. In about 1953, beneath part of the car park, Gillingham Borough Control Centre was built underground.\n\nWhen Gillingham Borough Council later merged with [[Rochester upon Medway]] to form the [[Medway|unitary Medway Authority]] in 1998, the buildings were still used as council offices and for meetings for several years afterwards. Later, Medway Council then moved into the former [[Lloyd's of London]] headquarters at Chatham Gun Wharf, and the Municipal Buildings were considered surplus to requirements. They were sold off in 2008 under a contract which turned them into a residential care home.<ref>John Clancy {{google books|zCD8AwAAQBAJ|Gillingham & Around Through Time|page=46}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe town grew along the road from Brompton on the great lines (military barracks), to the railway station. As such it was a linear development. Close by was the road along the shore line, linking The Strand, and the tiny village of Gillingham Green. Later, communities developed along the top road- Watling street \u2013 turnpike linking Chatham with Dover. All these communities merged into the town that is called today Gillingham.\n\n===Climate===\nGillingham experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Due to its southerly, sheltered, marine position near the European continent  the climate is among the warmest in the whole of England.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gillingham, Kent 1981\u20132010\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 8.0\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 11.1\n|Apr high C = 13.8\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 20.4\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 22.7\n|Sep high C = 20.0\n|Oct high C = 15.7\n|Nov high C = 11.2\n|Dec high C = 8.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan low C = 2.6\n|Feb low C = 2.0\n|Mar low C = 3.9\n|Apr low C = 5.4\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.5\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 13.7\n|Sep low C = 11.4\n|Oct low C = 8.4\n|Nov low C = 5.2\n|Dec low C = 2.8\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 66.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 40.2\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44.9\n|May precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 40.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 38.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 44.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 51.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 61.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57.0\n|year precipitation mm = \n|Jan rain days = 10.7\n|Feb rain days = 8.6\n|Mar rain days = 9.3\n|Apr rain days = 9.1\n|May rain days = 8.0\n|Jun rain days = 7.8\n|Jul rain days = 7.1\n|Aug rain days = 7.6\n|Sep rain days = 8.4\n|Oct rain days = 10.3\n|Nov rain days = 11.6\n|Dec rain days = 10.6\n|Jan sun = 44.0\n|Feb sun = 64.5\n|Mar sun = 106.8\n|Apr sun = 167.5\n|May sun = 185.1\n|Jun sun = 189.5\n|Jul sun = 208.0\n|Aug sun = 201.2\n|Sep sun = 152.6\n|Oct sun = 120.5\n|Nov sun = 67.7\n|Dec sun = 41.9\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web\n  | url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gillingham-fc#?tab=climateTables\n  | title=Gillingham FC Climatic Averages 1981\u20132010\n  | publisher=Met Office\n  | accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>\n|date=Dec 2012\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe name Gillingham is recorded in the [[Domesday book]] of 1086. It is said to have been named after a warlord, Gyllingas\u2014from the old English ''gyllan'', meaning \"to shout\". He was a notable man in Kent history as he led his warriors into battle screaming and shouting. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], Gillingham was a small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. It was given to the half-brother of [[William I of England]], [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], who rebuilt the parish church at Gillingham and constructed an Archbishop's Palace on land bordered by Grange Road, the ruins of which could still be seen in the last century. Gillingham itself, at the time, was a small hamlet, built around the parish church and surrounded by large farm-holdings, of which St. Mark's Parish formed part, being part of Brittain Farm.\n\n[[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]] mentioned Gillingham in his writings, saying: \"... two English\nmiles from Rochester and one mile from Chatham, where the King's ships do lie\". Adams was baptised at Gillingham Parish Church on 24 September 1564.<ref>WILL ADAMS: Gillingham\u2019s own Samurai.</ref>\n\n[[File:GillinghamStrand3117.JPG|thumb|right|The River Medway estuary at The Strand, Gillingham. The Kingsnorth power stations are on the opposite bank.]] The Strand was once owned by the Davenport family in 1635, the Davenport family included a Mayor of Gillingham,<ref name=amdavenport>[http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/query/results/?Mode=Search&PathList=&SearchWords=de0402_21&DateLis CityArt, Medway Council.] t</ref> pie makers and key holders of Gillingham. The Davenport family had a road named after them in 1920. The Davenport estate was in [[Ashford, Kent]]. The estate comprised around 15000 acres and was called The Davenport Manor. The Davenports lost the estate in 1889. The Davenport family were among the investors in the Chatham Dockyard.\nIn [[medieval]] times the part of Gillingham known as Grange was a limb of the [[Cinque Ports]]<ref>[http://www.medwaymemories.co.uk/?page_id=269 Stephen Rayner, \"A piece of Hastings \u2026 in a corner of Gillingham\", Medway memories.]</ref> and the maritime importance of the area continued until the late 1940s. Indeed, a large part of [[Chatham Dockyard]] lay within Gillingham: the [[dockyard]] started in Gillingham and, until the day it was closed in 1984, two-thirds of the then modern-day dockyard lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. The dockyard was founded by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] on the site of the present gun wharf, the establishment being transferred to the present site about 1622. In 1667 a Dutch fleet sailed up the [[River Medway]] and, having landed at [[Queenborough]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and laying siege to the fort at [[Sheerness]], invaded Gillingham in what became known as the [[raid on the Medway]]. The Dutch eventually retreated, but the incident caused great humiliation to the [[Royal Navy]].\n\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] began in 1756 and the government immediately gave orders for the defence of the dockyard; by 1758 the Chatham Lines of Defence were built. Over a mile long, they stretched across the neck of the dockyard [[peninsula]], from Chatham Reach, south of the dockyard, across to Gillingham Reach on the opposite side. One of the [[redoubt]]s on the Lines was at [[Fort Amherst|Amherst]]. The batteries faced away from the dockyard itself to forestall an attack from the landward side; the ships and shore-mounted guns on the river were considered sufficient to protect from that side. The lines of defence are now part of the [[Great Lines Heritage Park]] and also the Lower Lines Park (near [[MidKent College]], Gillingham Campus).\n[[File:GillinghamNavalWarMem2707.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chatham Naval Memorial]] on the Gillingham Great Lines]]\nWar with France began again in 1778, and once more it was necessary to strengthen the defences. Fort Amherst was the first to be improved; it was followed by work beginning in 1800 to add others at [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], Chatham, plus Fort Delce and [[Fort Clarence]] (both in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]); later in the 19th century others were added, including one at [[Fort Darland]] in Gillingham. Within all these buildings a barracks was built to house the soldiers. All this work, and the expansion of the dockyard, meant that more homes were needed for the workers. The position of the Lines meant that this building could only happen beyond, and so New Brompton came into being. The population rose to 9,000 people by 1851.\n\nGillingham was still only a small village; eventually it, too, was swallowed up, and the name of the whole settlement changed to Gillingham. In the 1891 census its population was 27,809, and in 1901, it was 42,530.\n\nIn 1919, after World War I, a [[Chatham Naval Memorial|naval war memorial]] in the shape of a white stone obelisk was set up on the Great Lines, from where it can be seen for many miles.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nigel Yates, ''Kent in the Twentieth Century''.</ref> Additional structures were added in 1945 to commemorate the dead of World War II. Similar monuments stand in the dockyard towns of [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]].\n\nIn 1919 the Frederick Burton family, which owned the old brick works, sold it and migrated to [[Auckland, New Zealand]] with their daughter Edith.\n\n===Disasters===\nGillingham has been the scene of two notable disasters: on 11 July 1929 a public demonstration by Gillingham Fire Brigade [[Gillingham Fair fire disaster|went wrong]], resulting in 15 fatalities;<ref>[http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/leisure/localhistory/timeline/17909/firemanswedding.htm Medway Council: \"Fireman's wedding disaster\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110173808/http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/leisure/localhistory/timeline/17909/firemanswedding.htm |date=10 January 2008 }}</ref> and in the [[1951 Gillingham bus disaster]], 24 Royal Marine cadets aged 10 to 13 were killed in a road accident.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Gillingham Bus Depot - geograph.org.uk - 726224.jpg|thumb|[[Arriva Medway Towns]] bus depot in Gillingham]]\nThe main source of employment was at [[Chatham Dockyard]], two-thirds of which lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. When it ceased to be a [[naval base]] in 1984, there was significant unemployment. A [[World Heritage Site]] application is today planned for the Dockyard and its defences.<ref>See www.chathamworldheritage.co.uk</ref> Since the 1980s, Gillingham has rebuilt its economic base and the ''Gillingham Business Park'' was set up {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the town centre, to attract investments and diversify economic activity. The business park is one of the most popular business locations in North [[Kent]] and is located about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]]. Gillingham has a [[marina]] called ''Gillingham Marina''. Gillingham is an important retail centre serving a substantial part of Medway. The town has a large [[street market]] in the High Street on Saturdays and Mondays, and is the busiest in the whole of Medway.<ref>''Gillingham Town Centre Development Framework''</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\n\nThe [[Roman road]] now known as [[Watling Street]] passed through Gillingham; and until the opening of the Medway Towns bypass (the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]]) in the mid-1960s the same route was followed by the traffic on the A2 to Dover. That road had been [[toll road|turnpiked]] in 1730, as part of the London\u2013[[Canterbury]] coaching route.\n\nIn June 1996 the [[Medway Tunnel]] opened, giving Gillingham a second link to the M2 and Strood.\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:GillinghamRail3959.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gillingham (Kent) railway station|Gillingham Railway Depot]]]]\nThe [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] opened its [[Chatham Main Line|line]] between Chatham and [[Faversham]] on 25 January 1858; and a country station was opened here called New Brompton. This was to serve the dockyard labourers' homes that had sprung up during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. A branch line led into the dockyard. The station later became [[Gillingham (Kent) railway station|Gillingham Railway Station]].\n\nServices improved significantly when in July 1939,<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Electric Railways \n |publisher='Stendec Systems' \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.electric-railways.co.uk/L2_DC_750_CR/1_general/g3_proj/prj-0d75-sr.html \n |accessdate=16 February 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003510/http://www.electric-railways.co.uk/L2_DC_750_CR/1_general/g3_proj/prj-0d75-sr.html \n |archivedate=28 September 2007 \n}}</ref> Gillingham became the terminus of the [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] system of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]].\n\n===Trams===\nGillingham was served by an electric tram system operated by the [[Chatham and District Light Railways Company]] from 1902 to 1930.<ref name=\"trams\">{{cite book| author=Harley, Robert J.| year=1994| title=Maidstone and Chatham Tramways| publisher=Middleton Press|isbn=1-873793-40-5}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Gillingham Library - geograph.org.uk - 518041.jpg|thumb|Gillingham Library]]\n\n===Library===\nGillingham Public Library is located in the High Street.\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:GillinghamPriestfields3982.JPG|thumb|right|Priestfield Stadium, Home of the Gills]]\n[[File:The Black Lion Leisure Centre, Mill Rd - geograph.org.uk - 1243346.jpg|right|thumb| A view of former The Black Lion Leisure Centre (Now Medway Park), April 2009.]]\nThe town is home to [[Gillingham FC|Gillingham F.C.]], who play at [[Priestfield Stadium]] and were first elected to the [[Football League]] in 1920 as members of the new [[Football League Third Division]] (south). They were voted out of the league in 1938, only to be re-elected when the league expanded in 1950. They spent the next 50 years bouncing between the two lower divisions before finally reaching the second tier (then [[Football League First Division|Division One]]) in the 1999\u20132000 season after beating Wigan Athletic in the Play-Off Final at Wembley.

Our Lady of Gillingham was built on the town of New Brompton, as Gillingham was then called, to mainly cater for the new workforce \u2013 those employed at [[Chatham Dockyard]]. The church itself was started in 1890, and was completed by 1896, being opened on 12 May 1896.\n\nA local Roman Catholic school was established on the site of the church in 1894. The schoolrooms were used until 1972, when the infant section of the school relocated to nearby Greenfield Road. in 1988, after more building work on the new site, the whole school was reunited on its new site at Greenfield Road. The Church (Our Lady of Gillingham) celebrated its centenary in May 1996, two years after the local school.\n[[File:GillinghamHighSt3949.JPG|left|thumb|St. Mark Church]]\nGillingham also has the J\u0101mi\u2019ah mosque and a Hindu Sabha Mandir.\n\nJames Jershom Jezreel, founder of the Jezreelite sect which flourished in the area during the 19th century, began the building of [[Jezreel's Tower]] on Chatham Hill.

For local government purposes it is also in the [[unitary authority]] of [[Medway]]. The town includes the settlements of [[Brompton, Medway|Brompton]], [[Hempstead, Kent|Hempstead]], [[Wigmore, Kent|Wigmore]], Parkwood, [[Rainham, Medway|Rainham]] which has its own significant retail and leisure hub, Rainham Mark and [[Twydall]].<!-- and [[Lidsing]] is not but used to be in the old Parish of Gillingham -->\n\nGillingham means a \"homestead of Gylla's family\", from [[Old English]] ''ham'' (\"village, homestead\") and ''ingas'' (\"family, followers\"), and was first recorded in the 10th century as ''Gyllingeham''.<ref>Also referred to in old texts as ''Jillyingham Water''.</ref> The town's name is pronounced with a soft 'g', compared to the hard 'g' used for [[Gillingham, Dorset]].\n\n==Status==\nGillingham became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], gaining [[municipal borough]] status in 1903.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Peter|title=Gillingham \u2013 from Rural District to Unitary Authority|url=http://gillinghamcorps.info/history.htm|website=The Salvation Army Gillingham Corps|accessdate=27 September 2015|date=2011}}</ref> John Robert Featherby was the first mayor of the Borough of Gillingham.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Featherby Family Tomb|url=http://www.historicmedway.co.uk/gillingham/st_mary_magdalene_grave_featherby.htm|website=Historic Medway|accessdate=27 September 2015|date=18 June 2012}}</ref> In 1928 [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] was added to the Gillingham Borough. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] it became a [[non-metropolitan district]]. It merged with the other Medway Towns (in the [[City of Rochester-upon-Medway]] district) in 1998 under the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|1990s UK local government reform]], to become part of the [[Medway]] unitary authority.\n\n===Town hall===\nThe Municipal Buildings in Canterbury Street were built as council offices for Gillingham Borough Council. They were opened by the Lord [[Mayor of London]], Sir [[George Broadbridge]], on 25 September 1937. The Lord Mayor was received at [[Gillingham Railway Station (Kent)|Gillingham Railway Station]] by a [[guard of honour]] of boys of [[HMS Arethusa (26)|HMS ''Arethusa'']]. Before the Second World War, air raid sirens were placed on the Municipal Buildings, and the local [[Civil Defence]] headquarters were in a single-storey building, to the rear of the car park. In about 1953, beneath part of the car park, Gillingham Borough Control Centre was built underground.\n\nWhen Gillingham Borough Council later merged with [[Rochester upon Medway]] to form the [[Medway|unitary Medway Authority]] in 1998, the buildings were still used as council offices and for meetings for several years afterwards. Later, Medway Council then moved into the former [[Lloyd's of London]] headquarters at Chatham Gun Wharf, and the Municipal Buildings were considered surplus to requirements. They were sold off in 2008 under a contract which turned them into a residential care home.<ref>John Clancy {{google books|zCD8AwAAQBAJ|Gillingham & Around Through Time|page=46}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe town grew along the road from Brompton on the great lines (military barracks), to the railway station. As such it was a linear development. Close by was the road along the shore line, linking The Strand, and the tiny village of Gillingham Green. Later, communities developed along the top road- Watling street \u2013 turnpike linking Chatham with Dover. All these communities merged into the town that is called today Gillingham.\n\n===Climate===\nGillingham experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Due to its southerly, sheltered, marine position near the European continent  the climate is among the warmest in the whole of England.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gillingham, Kent 1981\u20132010\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 8.0\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 11.1\n|Apr high C = 13.8\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 20.4\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 22.7\n|Sep high C = 20.0\n|Oct high C = 15.7\n|Nov high C = 11.2\n|Dec high C = 8.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan low C = 2.6\n|Feb low C = 2.0\n|Mar low C = 3.9\n|Apr low C = 5.4\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.5\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 13.7\n|Sep low C = 11.4\n|Oct low C = 8.4\n|Nov low C = 5.2\n|Dec low C = 2.8\n|year low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 66.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 40.2\n|Apr precipitation mm = 44.9\n|May precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 40.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 38.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 44.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 51.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 61.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 57.0\n|year precipitation mm = \n|Jan rain days = 10.7\n|Feb rain days = 8.6\n|Mar rain days = 9.3\n|Apr rain days = 9.1\n|May rain days = 8.0\n|Jun rain days = 7.8\n|Jul rain days = 7.1\n|Aug rain days = 7.6\n|Sep rain days = 8.4\n|Oct rain days = 10.3\n|Nov rain days = 11.6\n|Dec rain days = 10.6\n|Jan sun = 44.0\n|Feb sun = 64.5\n|Mar sun = 106.8\n|Apr sun = 167.5\n|May sun = 185.1\n|Jun sun = 189.5\n|Jul sun = 208.0\n|Aug sun = 201.2\n|Sep sun = 152.6\n|Oct sun = 120.5\n|Nov sun = 67.7\n|Dec sun = 41.9\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web\n  | url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gillingham-fc#?tab=climateTables\n  | title=Gillingham FC Climatic Averages 1981\u20132010\n  | publisher=Met Office\n  | accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>\n|date=Dec 2012\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe name Gillingham is recorded in the [[Domesday book]] of 1086. It is said to have been named after a warlord, Gyllingas\u2014from the old English ''gyllan'', meaning \"to shout\". He was a notable man in Kent history as he led his warriors into battle screaming and shouting. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], Gillingham was a small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. It was given to the half-brother of [[William I of England]], [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], who rebuilt the parish church at Gillingham and constructed an Archbishop's Palace on land bordered by Grange Road, the ruins of which could still be seen in the last century. Gillingham itself, at the time, was a small hamlet, built around the parish church and surrounded by large farm-holdings, of which St. Mark's Parish formed part, being part of Brittain Farm.\n\n[[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]] mentioned Gillingham in his writings, saying: \"... two English\nmiles from Rochester and one mile from Chatham, where the King's ships do lie\". Adams was baptised at Gillingham Parish Church on 24 September 1564.<ref>WILL ADAMS: Gillingham\u2019s own Samurai.</ref>\n\n[[File:GillinghamStrand3117.JPG|thumb|right|The River Medway estuary at The Strand, Gillingham. The Kingsnorth power stations are on the opposite bank.]] The Strand was once owned by the Davenport family in 1635, the Davenport family included a Mayor of Gillingham,<ref name=amdavenport>[http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/query/results/?Mode=Search&PathList=&SearchWords=de0402_21&DateLis CityArt, Medway Council.] t</ref> pie makers and key holders of Gillingham. The Davenport family had a road named after them in 1920. The Davenport estate was in [[Ashford, Kent]]. The estate comprised around 15000 acres and was called The Davenport Manor. The Davenports lost the estate in 1889. The Davenport family were among the investors in the Chatham Dockyard.\nIn [[medieval]] times the part of Gillingham known as Grange was a limb of the [[Cinque Ports]]<ref>[http://www.medwaymemories.co.uk/?page_id=269 Stephen Rayner, \"A piece of Hastings \u2026 in a corner of Gillingham\", Medway memories.]</ref> and the maritime importance of the area continued until the late 1940s. Indeed, a large part of [[Chatham Dockyard]] lay within Gillingham: the [[dockyard]] started in Gillingham and, until the day it was closed in 1984, two-thirds of the then modern-day dockyard lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. The dockyard was founded by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] on the site of the present gun wharf, the establishment being transferred to the present site about 1622. In 1667 a Dutch fleet sailed up the [[River Medway]] and, having landed at [[Queenborough]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and laying siege to the fort at [[Sheerness]], invaded Gillingham in what became known as the [[raid on the Medway]]. The Dutch eventually retreated, but the incident caused great humiliation to the [[Royal Navy]].\n\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] began in 1756 and the government immediately gave orders for the defence of the dockyard; by 1758 the Chatham Lines of Defence were built. Over a mile long, they stretched across the neck of the dockyard [[peninsula]], from Chatham Reach, south of the dockyard, across to Gillingham Reach on the opposite side. One of the [[redoubt]]s on the Lines was at [[Fort Amherst|Amherst]]. The batteries faced away from the dockyard itself to forestall an attack from the landward side; the ships and shore-mounted guns on the river were considered sufficient to protect from that side. The lines of defence are now part of the [[Great Lines Heritage Park]] and also the Lower Lines Park (near [[MidKent College]], Gillingham Campus).\n[[File:GillinghamNavalWarMem2707.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chatham Naval Memorial]] on the Gillingham Great Lines]]\nWar with France began again in 1778, and once more it was necessary to strengthen the defences. Fort Amherst was the first to be improved; it was followed by work beginning in 1800 to add others at [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], Chatham, plus Fort Delce and [[Fort Clarence]] (both in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]); later in the 19th century others were added, including one at [[Fort Darland]] in Gillingham. Within all these buildings a barracks was built to house the soldiers. All this work, and the expansion of the dockyard, meant that more homes were needed for the workers. The position of the Lines meant that this building could only happen beyond, and so New Brompton came into being. The population rose to 9,000 people by 1851.\n\nGillingham was still only a small village; eventually it, too, was swallowed up, and the name of the whole settlement changed to Gillingham. In the 1891 census its population was 27,809, and in 1901, it was 42,530.\n\nIn 1919, after World War I, a [[Chatham Naval Memorial|naval war memorial]] in the shape of a white stone obelisk was set up on the Great Lines, from where it can be seen for many miles.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nigel Yates, ''Kent in the Twentieth Century''.</ref> Additional structures were added in 1945 to commemorate the dead of World War II.

Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance.\n\nIn addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth.

Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance.\n\nIn addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children's hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.\n\n==International==\n* [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]], North America\n\n==Argentina==\n\n===Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires===\n* Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires\n* [[Hospital Garrahan|Garrahan Pediatric Hospital]]\n* Hospital de Ni\u00f1os R.

The game is televised nationally on the [[ESPN]] family of networks. [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] defeated [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] in the inaugural game in [[1997 Humanitarian Bowl|1997]].\n\n==History==\n===Conference tie-ins===\nThe Humanitarian Bowl was launched in part to give the [[Big West Conference]] a bowl to send its champion to.<ref name=bptpbg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=frReAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BTAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6184%2C980674 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|title=Boise planning to push bowl game to NCAA |date=April 19, 1997 |page=2B}}</ref> From 1982 until the end of the 1996 season, the Big West champion faced the winner of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) championship in a bowl; this was the [[California Bowl]] until 1991 and the [[Las Vegas Bowl]] afterward. After the 1996 game the Las Vegas Bowl renegotiated its contract, forcing both conferences to look for other options. This led to the creation of the Humanitarian Bowl as well as the creation of the [[Detroit]]-based [[Motor City Bowl]], where the MAC was to send its champion.\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999, the Big West champion was matched with a team from [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), while in 2000 the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) sent a representative. The Big West stopped sponsoring football after the 2000 season, and bowl organizers extended a permanent invite to the WAC to replace the Big West as host of the game, and struck an agreement with the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) to provide a [[Bowl eligibility|bowl-eligible]] team if it had yet to fill its bowl allotment. The WAC champion would receive the automatic bid to the game unless that team received a better offer from another bowl game or qualified for the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).\n\nThe WAC and ACC met in the 2001 through 2008 editions of the bowl, except for 2002 when the ACC's slot was filled by [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. In 2009, the [[Mountain West Conference]] was to provide a team, but Mountain West champion [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] was selected for the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] and the conference did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to send a replacement; as a result, [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green]] of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) was invited. In 2010, the bowl inherited the MAC's [[International Bowl]] tie-in after that [[Toronto]]-based bowl folded; the bowl featured a MAC vs. WAC matchup through 2012.\n\nAfter the WAC stopped sponsoring football in 2012, Mountain West inherited its spot as host, reaching agreement with the bowl to provide a team, starting with the December 2013 edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denver.sbnation.com/2012/12/15/3769946/famous-idaho-potato-bowl-2013-mountain-west |title=Famous Idaho Potato Bowl will be Mountain West partner in 2013 - SB Nation Denver |publisher=Denver.sbnation.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref> The bowl featured MAC vs. Mountain West matchups in the 2013 through 2015 games. In 2016, the bowl invited in-state [[Idaho Vandals football|Idaho]] of the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in place of a MAC team. The 2017 edition returned to MAC vs. Mountain West, while in the 2018 edition, [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]] was invited in place of a Mountain West team. In late July 2019, it was announced that the Mountain West and Mid-American Conferences would maintain their tie-ins to the bowl through the 2025\u201326 football season.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Season(s) || colspan=2 | Conferences\n|-\n!

After the 1996 game the Las Vegas Bowl renegotiated its contract, forcing both conferences to look for other options. This led to the creation of the Humanitarian Bowl as well as the creation of the [[Detroit]]-based [[Motor City Bowl]], where the MAC was to send its champion.\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999, the Big West champion was matched with a team from [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), while in 2000 the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) sent a representative. The Big West stopped sponsoring football after the 2000 season, and bowl organizers extended a permanent invite to the WAC to replace the Big West as host of the game, and struck an agreement with the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) to provide a [[Bowl eligibility|bowl-eligible]] team if it had yet to fill its bowl allotment. The WAC champion would receive the automatic bid to the game unless that team received a better offer from another bowl game or qualified for the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).\n\nThe WAC and ACC met in the 2001 through 2008 editions of the bowl, except for 2002 when the ACC's slot was filled by [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. In 2009, the [[Mountain West Conference]] was to provide a team, but Mountain West champion [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] was selected for the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] and the conference did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to send a replacement; as a result, [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green]] of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) was invited. In 2010, the bowl inherited the MAC's [[International Bowl]] tie-in after that [[Toronto]]-based bowl folded; the bowl featured a MAC vs. WAC matchup through 2012.\n\nAfter the WAC stopped sponsoring football in 2012, Mountain West inherited its spot as host, reaching agreement with the bowl to provide a team, starting with the December 2013 edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denver.sbnation.com/2012/12/15/3769946/famous-idaho-potato-bowl-2013-mountain-west |title=Famous Idaho Potato Bowl will be Mountain West partner in 2013 - SB Nation Denver |publisher=Denver.sbnation.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref> The bowl featured MAC vs. Mountain West matchups in the 2013 through 2015 games.

At the same time, however, I could not accept at face value the claim by some that the violence the Slavs suffered under fascism justified subsequent events in Istria or that all those who left Istria were compromised by fascism.

A major concern was the growing influence of American radio broadcasting as U.S.-based networks began to expand into Canada.\nMeanwhile, [[Canadian National Railways]] was making a radio network to keep its passengers entertained and give it an advantage over its rival, CP. This, the CNR Radio, is the forerunner of the CBC. [[Graham Spry]] and [[Alan Plaunt]] lobbied intensely for the project on behalf of the [[Canadian Radio League]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Babe |first1=Robert |title=Graham Spry |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/graham-spry |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 5, 2019}}</ref> In 1932 the government of [[R. B. Bennett]] established the CBC's predecessor, the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC).\n\nThe CRBC took over a network of [[radio station]]s formerly set up by a federal Crown corporation, the [[Canadian National Railway]]. The network was used to broadcast programming to riders aboard its passenger trains, with coverage primarily in central and eastern Canada. On November 2, 1936, the CRBC was reorganized under its present name. While the CRBC was a state-owned company, the CBC was a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] on the model of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], which had been reformed from a private company into a statutory corporation in 1927.  [[Leonard Brockington]] was the CBC's first chairman.\n\nFor the next few decades, the CBC was responsible for all broadcasting innovation in Canada.  This was in part because, until 1958, it was not only a broadcaster, but the chief regulator of Canadian broadcasting.  It used this dual role to snap up most of the [[clear-channel station|clear-channel licences]] in Canada.  It began a separate French-language radio network in 1937.  It introduced [[FM radio]] to Canada in 1946, though a distinct FM service wasn't launched until 1960.\n\nTelevision broadcasts from the CBC began on September 6, 1952, with the opening of a station in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] ([[CBFT]]), and a station in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] ([[CBLT]]) opening two days later. The CBC's first privately owned [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] television station, [[CICI-TV|CKSO]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, launched in October 1953. (At the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that relaxed in 1960\u201361 with the launch of [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].)\n\nFrom 1944 to 1962, the CBC split its English-language radio network into two services known as the [[Trans-Canada Network]] and the [[Dominion Network]]. The latter, carrying lighter programs including American radio shows, was dissolved in 1962, while the former became known as CBC Radio. (In the late 1990s, CBC Radio was rebranded as [[CBC Radio One]] and CBC Stereo as CBC Radio Two. The latter was re-branded slightly in 2007 as [[CBC Radio 2]].)\n\nOn July 1, 1958, CBC's television signal was extended from coast to coast. The first Canadian television show shot in colour was the CBC's own ''[[The Forest Rangers]]'' in 1963. Colour television broadcasts began on July 1, 1966, and full-colour service began in 1974. In 1978, CBC became the first broadcaster in the world to use an orbiting satellite for television service, linking Canada \"from east to west to north\". The mission of CBC is contribution to the \"moral economy of the nation\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mosaic|first=Taras|title=The ever-shrinking world of public broadcasting|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Frontier Coverage Package===\nStarting in 1967 and continuing until the mid-1970s, the CBC provided limited television service to remote and northern communities. Transmitters were built in a few locations and carried a four-hour selection of black-and-white videotaped programs each day. The tapes were flown into communities to be shown, then transported to other communities, often by the \"bicycle\" method used in [[television syndication]]. Transportation delays ranged from one week for larger centres to almost a month for small communities.\n\nThe first FCP station was started in [[Yellowknife]] in May 1967, the second in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] in November 1968. Additional stations were added from 1969 to 1972.\n\nMost of the FCP stations were fitted for the Anik satellite signal during 1973, carrying 12 hours of colour programming. Those serving the largest centres signed on with colour broadcasts on February 5, 1973, and most of the others were added before spring.  Broadcasts were geared to either the Atlantic time zone (UTC\u22124 or \u22123) or the Pacific time zone (UTC\u22128 or \u22127) even though the audience resided in communities in time zones varying from UTC\u22125 to UTC\u22128; the reason for this was that the CBC originated its programs for the Atlantic time zone, and a key station in each time zone would record the broadcast for the appropriate delay of one, two or three hours; the programs were originated again for the Pacific zone.  The northern stations simply picked up one of these two feeds, with the western NWT stations picking up the Pacific feed.  Some in northern areas of the provinces were connected by microwave to their own provincial broadcast centre.\n\nSome of these stations used non-CBC [[callsign]]s such as [[CFWH-TV]] in Whitehorse, CFYK in Yellowknife, CFFB in Frobisher Bay and CHAK in Inuvik, while some others used the standard CB_T call-sign but with five letters (e.g. CBDHT).\n\nUplinks in the North were usually a temporary unit brought in from the south.  A permanent uplink was established in Yellowknife, and later in Whitehorse and Iqaluit.\n\nTelevision programs originating in the north without the help of the south began with one half-hour per week in the 1980s with ''Focus North'' and graduating to a daily half-hour newscast, ''Northbeat'', in the late 1990s.  Until then, there were occasional temporary uplinks for such things as territorial election returns coverage; Yukon had the first such coverage in 1985, though because it happened during the Stanley Cup playoffs, equipment was already spoken for, so CBC rented the equipment of [[CITV-TV]] Edmonton to use in Whitehorse that evening.\n\n===CBC Television slogans===\n* 1966: \"Television is CBC\"\n* 1970: \"When you watch, watch the best\"\n* 1977: \"Bringing Canadians Together\"\n* 1980: \"We Are the CBC\"\n* 1984: \"Look to us for good things\" (general) / \"Good to Know\" (news and public affairs)\n* 1986\u20131989: \"The Best on the Box\"\n* 1989\u20131992: \"CBC and You\"\n* 1992\u20131994: \"Go Public\" / \"CBC: Public Broadcasting\" (to emphasize that CBC is a public broadcaster)\n* 1995\u20132001: \"Television to Call Our Own\" and \"Radio to Call Our Own\"\n* 2001\u20132007: \"Canada\u2019s Own\"\n* 2007\u20132014: \"Canada Lives Here\"\n* 2009\u2013present: \"Mon monde est \u00e0 Radio-Canada, SRC\" (English translation: My world is on Radio-Canada)\n* 2011 and 2016: \"Yours to Celebrate\" (French: \"Un monde \u00e0 c\u00e9l\u00e9brer\") (for the CBC's 75th and 80th anniversaries)\n* 2014\u2013present: \"Love CBC\" / \"Fall for CBC\"\n\n=== Logos ===\n<gallery heights=\"100\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:CBC logo 1940\u20131958.png|1940\u20131958\nFile:CBC Logo 1974-1986.svg|1974\u20131986\nFile:CBC Logo 1986-1992.svg|1986\u20131992\nFile:CBC Logo 1992-Present.svg|1992\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\nThe original logo of the CBC, designed by [[\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts (Montreal)|\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts]] student Hortense Binette<ref name=\"cbclogo\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/cbc-logo/ | publisher=CBC News | title=Retro revival: CBC's changing logo through the years}}</ref> and used between 1940 and 1958, featured a map of Canada (and from 1940 to 1949, [[Newfoundland (Dominion)|Newfoundland]]) and a thunderbolt design used to symbolize broadcasting.\n\nIn 1958, the CBC adopted a new logo for use at the end of network programs. Designed by scale model artist Jean-Paul Boileau, it consisted of the legends \"CBC\" and \"Radio-Canada\" overlaid on a map of Canada.  For French programming, the \"Radio-Canada\" was placed on top.\n\nThe \"Butterfly\" logo was designed for the CBC by Hubert Tison in 1966 to mark the network's progressing transition from black-and-white to colour television, much in the manner of the [[NBC logos|NBC peacock logo]]. It was used at the beginning of programs broadcast in colour, and was used until all CBC television programs had switched to colour. A sketch on the CBC Television program ''[[Wayne & Shuster]]'' once referred to this as the logo of the \"Cosmic Butterfly Corporation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVGJXuBY88 |title=YouTube \u2013 CBC Butterfly |via=YouTube |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth logo, known internally as \"the gem\", was designed for the CBC by graphic artist [[Burton Kramer]] in December 1974, and it is the most widely recognised symbol of the corporation. The main on-air [[Station identification|identification]] featured the logo kaleidoscopically morphing into its form while radiating outward from the centre of the screen on a blue background. This animated version, which went to air in December 1974, is also known colloquially as \"The Exploding Pizza\". The appearance of this logo marked the arrival of full-colour network television service. The large shape in the middle is the letter C, which stands for Canada, and the radiating parts of the C symbolize broadcasting. The original theme music for the 1974 CBC ident was a three-note woodwind orchestral fanfare accompanied by the voiceover \"This is CBC\" or \"Ici Radio-Canada\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bli95IO1izs |title=YouTube \u2013 RARE \u2013 Ici Radio-Canada \u2013 Musique diff\u00e9rente |via=YouTube |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> This was later replaced by a different, and more familiar 11-note woodwind orchestral jingle, which was used until December 31, 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_NEnBjYpI |title=YouTube \u2013 This is CBC 1982 |via=YouTube |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccca.concordia.ca/artists/image.html?languagePref=en&url=/c/images/big/k/kramerdesign/krad016.jpg&cright=Burton+Kramer+Design&mkey=52606&link_id=5490 |title=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation logo and television identification storyboard |publisher=Ccca.ca |date=March 15, 2001 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe updated one-colour version of the gem/pizza logo, created by Hubert Tison and Robert Innes,<ref name=\"cbclogo\" /> was introduced on January 1, 1986, and with it was introduced a new series of computer graphic-generated television idents for CBC and Radio-Canada. These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo, accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC's new, synthesized five-note jingle. The logo was changed to one colour, generally dark blue on white, or white on dark blue, in 1986. Print ads and most television promos, however, have always used a single-colour version of this logo since 1974.\n\nIn 1992, CBC updated its logo design to make it simpler and more red (or white on a red background). The new logo design, created by Swiss-Canadian design firm Gottschalk + Ash,<ref name=\"cbclogo\" /> reduces the number of geometric sections in the logo to 13 instead of the previous logo's 25, and the \"C\" in the centre of the logo became a simple red circle. According to graphic designer Todd Falkowsky, the logo's red colour also represents Canada in a symbolic way. With the launch of the current design, new television idents were introduced in November that year, also using CGI. Since the early 2000s, it has also appeared in white (sometimes red) on a textured or coloured background. It is now CBC/Radio-Canada's longest-used logo, surpassing the original incarnation of the Gem logo and the CBC's 1940 logo.\n\n==Corporation==\n{{Main|List of assets owned by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}\n[[File:CBC Radio-Canada - Ottawa.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre]] in [[Ottawa]], seen from Sparks Street.]]\n\n===Mandate===\nThe 1991 Broadcasting Act<ref name=\"justice1\">{{cite web|url=https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-9.01/ |title=Broadcasting Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=January 3, 2020}}</ref> states that...\n\n<blockquote>...the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as the national public broadcaster, should provide radio and television services incorporating a wide range of programming that informs, enlightens and entertains;\n\n...the programming provided by the Corporation should:\n* be predominantly and distinctively Canadian,\n* reflect Canada and its regions to national and regional audiences, while serving the special needs of those regions,\n* actively contribute to the flow and exchange of cultural expression,\n* be in English and in French, reflecting the different needs and circumstances of each official language community, including the particular needs and circumstances of English and French linguistic minorities,\n* strive to be of equivalent quality in English and French,\n* contribute to shared national consciousness and identity,\n* be made available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means and as resources become available for the purpose, and\n* reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Management===\nAs a [[crown corporation]], the CBC operates at arm's length (autonomously) from the government in its day-to-day business.

Expenditures for the year included $616&nbsp;million for English television, $402&nbsp;million for French television, $126&nbsp;million for specialty channels, a total of $348&nbsp;million for radio services in both languages, $88&nbsp;million for management and technical costs, and $124&nbsp;million for \"[[amortization (business)|amortization]] of property and equipment.\" Some of this spending was derived from amortization of funding from previous years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/annualreports/2005-2006/pdf/financials-e.pdf |title=CBC Annual Report 2005-2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009124451/http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/annualreports/2005-2006/pdf/financials-e.pdf |archivedate=October 9, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAmong its revenue sources for the [[Canadian federal budget, 2005|year ending March 31, 2006]], the CBC received $946&nbsp;million in its annual funding from the federal government, as well as $60&nbsp;million in \"one-time\" supplementary funding for programming. However, this supplementary funding has been repeated annually for a number of years. This combined total is just over a billion dollars annually and is a source of heated debate. To supplement this funding, the CBC's television networks and websites sell advertising, while cable/satellite-only services such as CBC News Network additionally collect subscriber fees, in line with their privately owned counterparts. CBC's radio services do not sell advertising except when required by law (for example, to political parties during federal elections).\n\nCBC's funding differs from that of the public broadcasters of many European nations, which collect a [[television licence|licence fee]], or those in the United States, such as [[PBS]] and [[NPR]], which receive some public funding but rely to a large extent on voluntary contributions from individual viewers and listeners. A Nanos Research poll from August 2014 conducted for Asper Media (National Post, Financial Post) showed 41% of Canadians wanted funding increased, 46% wanted it maintained at current levels, and only 10% wanted to see it cut.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Csanady  | first = Ashley  | title = Majority of Conservative voters like the CBC: poll  | website = Canada.com  | date = September 5, 2014  | url = http://o.canada.com/news/politics-and-the-nation/majority-of-conservative-voters-like-the-cbc-poll  | accessdate = May 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe network's defenders note that the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; that much of the public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks can fill up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost. CBC supporters also point out that additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canadian Media Guild]], the  $115-million deficit reduction action plan cuts to CBC which started with the 2012 budget and were fully realized in 2014, amounted to \"one of the biggest layoffs of content creators and journalists in Canadian history.\" The 2014 cuts combined with earlier ones totalled \"3,600 jobs lost at CBC since 2008.

CBC Radio One and Premi\u00e8re focus on [[news]] and information programming, but they air some music programs, variety shows and comedy; in the past, they also aired some sports programming. CBC Radio One and Premi\u00e8re used to broadcast primarily on the [[AM radio|AM band]], but many stations have moved over to [[FM radio|FM]]. Over the years, a number of CBC radio transmitters with a majority of them on the AM band have either moved to FM or had shut down completely. \n{{further|List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada}}\n\nThe CBC plans to phase out more CBC AM transmitters across Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/_files/cbcrc/documents/submissions/long-range-radio-plan.pdf|title=CBC/Radio-Canada - Long Range Radio Plan|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> This goal however remains to be seen in light of the CBC budget cutbacks.\n\n===''Radio Guide''===\n\nBeginning in 1981, CBC radio launched the monthly magazine ''Radio Guide'', which included CBC Radio program listings alongside feature content, such as profiles of musicians and writers and behind the scenes looks at CBC programs.<ref>\"Ideas' producer has to be open to anything\".

The CBC is not subject to any conditions or expectations concerning its LRRP. The CBC noted that Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene (now Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re) and CBC Radio One were available to about 99 percent of the Canadian population. The CBC stated that it plans to maintain its radio service but has no plans to grow the coverage area. It described the LRRP as a planning vehicle and indicated that it would no longer use it. Given reductions in public funding to the CBC and given that Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene and Radio One are available to the vast majority of Canadians, the commission considers that the CBC's plan to maintain current coverage and discontinue the LRRP is reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission accepts the CBC's proposal to discontinue the LRRP.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-263.htm#bm275 Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-263], Availability of radio service, ''CRTC'', May 28, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other CBC Radio services===\nCBC Music and ''Ici musique'', found exclusively on FM, air arts and cultural programming, with a focus on music. CBC Radio 3, found only online and on satellite radio, airs exclusively independent Canadian music.\n\nCBC Radio also operated two [[shortwave]] services. One, [[Radio Nord Qu\u00e9bec#Shortwave service|Radio Nord Qu\u00e9bec]], broadcast domestically to Northern Quebec on a static frequency of 9625 [[Kilohertz|kHz]], and the other, [[Radio Canada International]], provided broadcasts to the United States and around the world in eight languages.

The CRTC approved the subscription radio application, as well as two others for satellite radio service, on June 16, 2005. [[Sirius Canada]] launched on December 1, 2005, with a number of CBC Radio channels, including the new services [[CBC Radio 3]] and ''[[Bande \u00e0 part (radio)|Bande \u00e0 part]]''.\n\nIn some areas, especially national or provincial parks, the CBC also operates an [[AM radio|AM]] or [[FM radio|FM]] transmitter rebroadcasting weather alerts from the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]]'s [[Weatheradio Canada]] service.\n\n===Television===\n{{further|CBC Television|Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9}}\nThe CBC operates two national broadcast television networks; [[CBC Television]] in English, and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]] in French. Like private broadcasters, both those networks sell advertising, but offer more Canadian-produced programming. All CBC television stations are owned and operated by the CBC itself and carry a common schedule, aside from local programming and other [[regional variation]] (such as the [[CBC North]] stations in [[Nunavut]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and the [[Yukon]] carrying an additional newscast in the [[Inuktitut]] language and a weekly [[Cree language|Cree]] program), and [[CBET-DT]] in Windsor amending its non-primetime schedule at various points due to program rights conflicts with [[Detroit]] stations). \n\nBoth CBC's English and French networks previously had a number of private [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s owned by third-party owners. However, the majority of them have either been bought by the CBC and subsequently shut down during the transition to digital television, or have switched to other networks and program services. The only remaining privately-owned affiliate of any CBC-owned network is Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 affiliate [[CKRT-DT]] in [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]] (which is part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|triplestick]] also containing private affiliates for Quebec's two private networks).\n\nOne of the most popular shows is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] games. In English, the program is known as ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', and in French, it was called ''[[La Soir\u00e9e du hockey]]''. Both shows began in 1952. The French edition was discontinued in 2004, though Radio-Canada stations outside of Quebec simulcast some Saturday night games produced by [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]] until 2006. The network suffered considerable public embarrassment when it lost the rights to the show's [[The Hockey Theme|theme music]] following a protracted lawsuit launched by the song's composer and publishers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Campbell |first=Charles |title=Mediacheck: How CBC Lost Its Hockey Theme |magazine=The Tyee |date= June 13, 2008 |url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/06/13/HockeyAnthem/ |access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref>  In 2013, the exclusive national media rights to the NHL were acquired by [[Rogers Media]], although Rogers would reach an agreement with the CBC to license the ''Hockey Night in Canada'' brand for use in its [[NHL on Sportsnet|coverage]] of Saturday-night games, and [[Brokered programming|broker]] a version of the broadcasts to CBC at no charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2013/11/26/nhl_deal_with_rogers_a_huge_blow_to_tsn_and_cbc_mudhar.html|title=NHL deal with Rogers huge blow to CBC: Mudhar|work=Toronto Star|date=November 26, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/rogers-cbc-sign-new-7-year-deal-hockey-night-canada/|title=Rogers and CBC sign new 7-year deal for Hockey Night in Canada|website= Sportsnet.ca|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe CBC also wholly owns and operates three specialty television channels \u2014 the news channels [[CBC News Network]] and [[Ici RDI]], and the French-language network [[Ici Explora]].

Local newscasts were cut back to the bare minimum. This had the effect of delaying the debut of ''[[The Journal (Canadian TV show)|The Journal]]'', which had to wait until January 1982.\n\nOn August 15, 2005, 5,500 employees of the CBC (about 90%) were [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] by CBC CEO [[Robert Rabinovitch]] in a dispute over future hiring practices. At issue were the rules governing the hiring of contract workers in preference to full-time hires. The locked-out employees were members of the [[Canadian Media Guild]], representing all production, journalistic and on-air personnel outside [[Quebec]] and [[Moncton]], including several foreign correspondents. While CBC services continued during the lock-out, they were primarily made up of repeats, with news programming from the [[BBC]] and newswires. Major CBC programs such as ''The National'' and ''Royal Canadian Air Farce'' were not produced during the lock-out; some non-CBC-owned programs seen on the network, such as ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', shifted to other studios. Meanwhile, the locked-out employees produced podcasts and websites such as CBCunplugged.com.\n\nAfter a hiatus, talks re-opened. On September 23, [[Joe Fontana]], the federal minister of labour, called Robert Rabinovitch and Arnold Amber (the president of the CBC branch of the [[Canadian Media Guild]]) to his office for talks aimed at ending the dispute.\n\nLate in the evening of October 2, 2005, it was announced that the CBC management and staff had reached a tentative deal which resulted in the CBC returning to normal operations on October 11. Some speculated that the looming October 8 start date for the network's most important television property, ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', had acted as an additional incentive to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe CBC has been affected by a number of other labour disputes since the late 1990s:\n* In early 1999, CBC English- and French-network technicians in all locations outside Quebec and [[Moncton]], members of the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada]], went on strike.<ref>[http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/newsreleases/19990217.shtml CBC Position on CEP Strike Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304233622/http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/newsreleases/19990217.shtml |date=March 4, 2012 }}</ref> The [[Canadian Media Guild]] was set to strike as well, but the CBC settled with both unions.<ref>[http://www.playbackmag.com/articles/magazine/19990405/25116.html CEP, CMG ink deal with CBC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083757/http://www.playbackmag.com/articles/magazine/19990405/25116.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n* A similar dispute, again involving all technicians outside Quebec and Moncton, occurred in late 2001 and concluded by the end of the year.<ref>[http://www.cep.ca/press/cepnews_e.php?id=102 CBC Technicians' Lockout Ends &mdash; Collective agreement ratified by CEP membership] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005722/http://www.cep.ca/press/cepnews_e.php?id=102 |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n* In spring 2002, on-air staff in Quebec and Moncton (again, on both English and French networks) were locked out by local management, leaving, among other things, NHL playoff games without commentary on French television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-020603.html |title=North East RadioWatch: June 3, 2002 |publisher=Bostonradio.org |date=June 3, 2002 |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile all labour disputes resulted in cut-back programming and numerous repeat airings, the 2005 lock-out may have been the most damaging to CBC. All local programming in the affected regions was cancelled and replaced by abbreviated national newscasts and national radio morning shows. [[BBC World]] (television) and [[BBC World Service|World Service]] (radio) and [[The Canadian Press|Broadcast News]] feeds were used to provide the remainder of original news content, and the CBC website consisted mainly of rewritten wire copy. Some BBC staff protested against their material being used during the CBC lock-out. \"The [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] and [[Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union|BECTU]] will not tolerate their members' work being used against colleagues in Canada\", said a joint statement by BBC unions. The CMG questioned<ref>[http://www.cmg.ca/cbcnegsmediaEN.html#BBC BBC benefits on the backs of CBC employees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211002604/http://www.cmg.ca/cbcnegsmediaEN.html#BBC |date=December 11, 2005 }}</ref> whether, with its limited Canadian news content, the CBC was meeting its legal requirements under the [[Broadcasting Act (1968)|Broadcasting Act]] and its CRTC licences.\n\n[[Galaxie (radio)|Galaxie]] (which CBC owned at the time) supplied some music content for the radio networks. Tapes of aired or produced documentaries, interviews and entertainment programs were also aired widely. Selected television sports coverage, including that of the [[Canadian Football League]], continued, but without commentary.\n\nAs before, French-language staff outside of Quebec were also affected by the 2005 lock-out, although with Quebec producing the bulk of the French networks' programming, those networks were not as visibly affected by the dispute apart from local programs.\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n===Newsworld International and Trio===\nFrom 1994 to 2000, the CBC, in a venture with [[Power Corporation of Canada|Power Broadcasting]] (former owner of [[CKWS-TV|CKWS]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]), jointly owned two networks:\n\n# [[Newsworld International]] (NWI), an American cable channel that rebroadcast much of the programming of CBC Newsworld (now known as CBC News Network).\n# [[Trio channel|Trio]], an arts and entertainment channel.\n\nIn 2000, CBC and Power Broadcasting sold these channels to [[Barry Diller]]'s [[USA Networks]]. Diller's company was later acquired by [[Vivendi Universal]], which in turn was partially acquired by [[NBC]] to form [[NBC Universal]]. NBC Universal still owns the Trio brand, which no longer has any association with the CBC (and became an Internet-only broadband channel which was later folded into [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]].) The channel was shut down and was replaced with the NBC Universal channel Sleuth, which later became [[Cloo]].\n\nHowever, the CBC continued to program NWI, with much of its programming simulcast on the domestic Newsworld service. In late 2004, as a result of a further change in NWI's ownership to the [[INdTV]] consortium (including [[Joel Hyatt]] and former [[Vice-President of the United States]] [[Al Gore]]), NWI ceased airing CBC programming on August 1, 2005, when it became [[Current TV]]. Current later folded and became [[Al Jazeera America]] on August 20, 2013.\n\n===U.S. border audiences===\nIn U.S. border communities such as [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] and [[Seattle]], Washington; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York; [[Detroit]], Michigan and [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Vermont, CBC radio and television stations can be received [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and have a significant audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/sports/olympics/21cbc.html|title=Canadian TV switch displeases Americans|first=Joanne|last=Gerstner|work=The New York Times|date=February 20, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Farther from the border, some American fans of the network have acquired Canadian IP addresses to stream its sports broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/some-us-viewers-turn-to-cbc-amid-complaints-about-nbcs-olympic-coverage/article16790846/|title=Some U.S. viewers turn to CBC amid complaints about NBC's Olympic coverage|first=Cassandra|last=Szklarski|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Some CBC programming is also rebroadcast on local public radio, such as [[New Hampshire Public Radio]], [[Vermont Public Radio]] and the [[Maine Public Broadcasting Network]]. CBC television channels are available on cable systems located near the Canada\u2013U.S. border. For example, [[CBET-DT|CBET]] [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] is available on cable systems in the [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and [[Toledo, Ohio]], areas; much of the rest of the state of Michigan receives [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] [[Montreal]] on cable. [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] [[Vancouver]] is broadcast on [[Comcast]] in the [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], area. At night, the AM radio transmissions of both CBC and Radio-Canada services can be received over much of the northern portion of the United States, from stations such as [[CBW (AM)|CBW]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[CBK (AM)|CBK]] in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]] in [[Toronto]].\n\n===Carriage of CBC News===\nOn September 11, 2001, several American broadcasters without their own news operations, including [[C-SPAN]], carried the CBC's coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the days after September 11, C-SPAN carried CBC's nightly newscast, ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]]'', anchored by [[Peter Mansbridge]]. The quality of this coverage was recognised specifically by the [[Canadian Journalism Foundation]]; editor-in-chief [[Tony Burman]] later accepted the Excellence in Journalism Award (2004), for \"rigorous professional practice, accuracy, originality and public accountability\", on behalf of the service.\n\nC-SPAN has also carried CBC's coverage of major events affecting Canadians, including: [[Canadian federal election]]s, key proceedings in [[Parliament of Canada]], Six days in September 2000 that marked the [[death and state funeral of Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], the [[2003 North America blackout|power outage crisis]] in summer 2003, [[U.S. presidential election]]s (e.g. in [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004]], C-SPAN picked up ''The National'' the day after the election for the view from Canadians), state visits and official visits of [[President of United States|American presidents]] to Canada, and [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Barack Obama inauguration]] in 2009.\n\nSeveral [[PBS]] stations also air some CBC programming. However, these programs are syndicated by independent distributors, and are not governed by the PBS \"common carriage\" policy.\n\nOther American broadcast networks sometimes air CBC reports, especially for Canadian events of international significance. For example, in the early hours after the [[Swissair Flight 111]] disaster, [[CNN]] aired CBC's live coverage of the event. Also in the late 1990s, [[CNN Headline News]] aired a few CBC reports of events that were not significant outside Canada.\n\n===CBC Radio===\nSome CBC Radio One programs, such as ''[[Definitely Not the Opera]]'', ''[[WireTap]]'', ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', and ''[[As It Happens]]'', also air on some stations associated with [[American Public Media]] or [[Public Radio International]]. Some of the CBC's radio networks are available to [[Sirius XM Holdings|SiriusXM]] subscribers in the United States, including CBC Radio One (a special feed that exclusively contains CBC-produced content and no regional programs) and Premi\u00e8re (a simulcast of its Montreal flagship [[CBF-FM]]), CBC Radio 3, and music-oriented services exclusive to SiriusXM.\n\n===Caribbean and Bermuda===\nSeveral Caribbean nations carry feeds of CBC TV:\n* [[Bahamas]], on the coral wave (Cable Bahamas) television system in the Northern Bahamas (Channel 8).\n* [[Barbados]],\n**on the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation]] [[Multi-Choice TV (Barbados)|Multi-Choice TV]] Cable system (Channel 703), and\n**on the [[Columbus Communications]] owned cable system \"Flow Barbados\" (channel 132).\n* [[Bermuda]], on the CableVision digital cable service.\n* [[Grenada]], carried on [[Columbus Communications]] owned cable system ''Flow Grenada''.\n* [[Jamaica]], distributed in areas served by ''Flow Jamaica''.\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on the [[Columbus Communications]] Trinidad Ltd. (CCTL) television system.\n\n===Availability of CBC channels and programming===\nCBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, CBC News Network and all other CBC channels can be received through cable and satellite TV channel providers across Canada, like through [[Bell TV]], [[Rogers Cable]], [[Videotron]], [[Cogeco]], and other smaller TV providers. The CBC and Radio-Canada channel signals can also be obtained free of charge, over-the-air, through antenna receivers in Canada's largest markets or in some border states along the Canada-U.S. border; however, CBC is not obtainable as a \"[[free-to-air]]\" (FTA) channel on FTA satellites (signals are encrypted on the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] space satellites and require a dedicated satellite receiver).\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Closed captioning===\nCBC Television was an early leader in broadcasting programming with [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired, airing its first captioned programming in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1980s.shtml |title=CBC/RadioCanada\u2013History\u20131980s |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628204745/http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1980s.shtml |archivedate=June 28, 2010 }}</ref> Captioned programming in Canada began with the airing of ''[[Clown White]]'' in English-language and French-language versions on CBC Television and Radio-Canada, respectively.

Broadcasters could either continue serving those markets by transitioning analogue transmitters to digital or cease broadcasting over-the-air. Cable, IPTV, and satellite services are not involved or affected by this digital transition deadline.\n\nWhile its fellow Canadian broadcasters converted most of their transmitters to digital by the [[Digital television in Canada|Canadian digital television transition]] deadline of August 31, 2011, CBC converted only about half of the analogue transmitters in mandatory to digital (15 of 28 markets with CBC TV, and 14 of 28 markets with SRC). Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published a plan whereby communities that receive analogue signals by re-broadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air (OTA) signals as of the deadline.  Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and SRC transmitters in mandatory markets.  Mandatory markets losing both CBC and SRC over-the-air signals include [[London, Ontario]] (metropolitan area population 457,000) and [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] (metro area 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not converted to digital.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, CBC shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters, following an announcement of these plans on April 4, 2012.  This reduced the total number of the corporation's television transmitters across the country to 27. According to the CBC, this would reduce the corporation's yearly costs by $10&nbsp;million. No plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both CBC and SRC in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter.

A major concern was the growing influence of American radio broadcasting as U.S.-based networks began to expand into Canada.\nMeanwhile, [[Canadian National Railways]] was making a radio network to keep its passengers entertained and give it an advantage over its rival, CP. This, the CNR Radio, is the forerunner of the CBC. [[Graham Spry]] and [[Alan Plaunt]] lobbied intensely for the project on behalf of the [[Canadian Radio League]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Babe |first1=Robert |title=Graham Spry |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/graham-spry |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 5, 2019}}</ref> In 1932 the government of [[R. B. Bennett]] established the CBC's predecessor, the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC).\n\nThe CRBC took over a network of [[radio station]]s formerly set up by a federal Crown corporation, the [[Canadian National Railway]]. The network was used to broadcast programming to riders aboard its passenger trains, with coverage primarily in central and eastern Canada. On November 2, 1936, the CRBC was reorganized under its present name. While the CRBC was a state-owned company, the CBC was a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] on the model of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], which had been reformed from a private company into a statutory corporation in 1927.  [[Leonard Brockington]] was the CBC's first chairman.\n\nFor the next few decades, the CBC was responsible for all broadcasting innovation in Canada.  This was in part because, until 1958, it was not only a broadcaster, but the chief regulator of Canadian broadcasting.  It used this dual role to snap up most of the [[clear-channel station|clear-channel licences]] in Canada.  It began a separate French-language radio network in 1937.  It introduced [[FM radio]] to Canada in 1946, though a distinct FM service wasn't launched until 1960.\n\nTelevision broadcasts from the CBC began on September 6, 1952, with the opening of a station in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] ([[CBFT]]), and a station in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] ([[CBLT]]) opening two days later. The CBC's first privately owned [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] television station, [[CICI-TV|CKSO]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, launched in October 1953. (At the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that relaxed in 1960\u201361 with the launch of [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].)\n\nFrom 1944 to 1962, the CBC split its English-language radio network into two services known as the [[Trans-Canada Network]] and the [[Dominion Network]]. The latter, carrying lighter programs including American radio shows, was dissolved in 1962, while the former became known as CBC Radio. (In the late 1990s, CBC Radio was rebranded as [[CBC Radio One]] and CBC Stereo as CBC Radio Two. The latter was re-branded slightly in 2007 as [[CBC Radio 2]].)\n\nOn July 1, 1958, CBC's television signal was extended from coast to coast. The first Canadian television show shot in colour was the CBC's own ''[[The Forest Rangers]]'' in 1963. Colour television broadcasts began on July 1, 1966, and full-colour service began in 1974. In 1978, CBC became the first broadcaster in the world to use an orbiting satellite for television service, linking Canada \"from east to west to north\". The mission of CBC is contribution to the \"moral economy of the nation\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mosaic|first=Taras|title=The ever-shrinking world of public broadcasting|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Frontier Coverage Package===\nStarting in 1967 and continuing until the mid-1970s, the CBC provided limited television service to remote and northern communities. Transmitters were built in a few locations and carried a four-hour selection of black-and-white videotaped programs each day. The tapes were flown into communities to be shown, then transported to other communities, often by the \"bicycle\" method used in [[television syndication]]. Transportation delays ranged from one week for larger centres to almost a month for small communities.\n\nThe first FCP station was started in [[Yellowknife]] in May 1967, the second in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] in November 1968. Additional stations were added from 1969 to 1972.\n\nMost of the FCP stations were fitted for the Anik satellite signal during 1973, carrying 12 hours of colour programming. Those serving the largest centres signed on with colour broadcasts on February 5, 1973, and most of the others were added before spring.  Broadcasts were geared to either the Atlantic time zone (UTC\u22124 or \u22123) or the Pacific time zone (UTC\u22128 or \u22127) even though the audience resided in communities in time zones varying from UTC\u22125 to UTC\u22128; the reason for this was that the CBC originated its programs for the Atlantic time zone, and a key station in each time zone would record the broadcast for the appropriate delay of one, two or three hours; the programs were originated again for the Pacific zone.  The northern stations simply picked up one of these two feeds, with the western NWT stations picking up the Pacific feed.  Some in northern areas of the provinces were connected by microwave to their own provincial broadcast centre.\n\nSome of these stations used non-CBC [[callsign]]s such as [[CFWH-TV]] in Whitehorse, CFYK in Yellowknife, CFFB in Frobisher Bay and CHAK in Inuvik, while some others used the standard CB_T call-sign but with five letters (e.g. CBDHT).\n\nUplinks in the North were usually a temporary unit brought in from the south.  A permanent uplink was established in Yellowknife, and later in Whitehorse and Iqaluit.\n\nTelevision programs originating in the north without the help of the south began with one half-hour per week in the 1980s with ''Focus North'' and graduating to a daily half-hour newscast, ''Northbeat'', in the late 1990s.  Until then, there were occasional temporary uplinks for such things as territorial election returns coverage; Yukon had the first such coverage in 1985, though because it happened during the Stanley Cup playoffs, equipment was already spoken for, so CBC rented the equipment of [[CITV-TV]] Edmonton to use in Whitehorse that evening.\n\n===CBC Television slogans===\n* 1966: \"Television is CBC\"\n* 1970: \"When you watch, watch the best\"\n* 1977: \"Bringing Canadians Together\"\n* 1980: \"We Are the CBC\"\n* 1984: \"Look to us for good things\" (general) / \"Good to Know\" (news and public affairs)\n* 1986\u20131989: \"The Best on the Box\"\n* 1989\u20131992: \"CBC and You\"\n* 1992\u20131994: \"Go Public\" / \"CBC: Public Broadcasting\" (to emphasize that CBC is a public broadcaster)\n* 1995\u20132001: \"Television to Call Our Own\" and \"Radio to Call Our Own\"\n* 2001\u20132007: \"Canada\u2019s Own\"\n* 2007\u20132014: \"Canada Lives Here\"\n* 2009\u2013present: \"Mon monde est \u00e0 Radio-Canada, SRC\" (English translation: My world is on Radio-Canada)\n* 2011 and 2016: \"Yours to Celebrate\" (French: \"Un monde \u00e0 c\u00e9l\u00e9brer\") (for the CBC's 75th and 80th anniversaries)\n* 2014\u2013present: \"Love CBC\" / \"Fall for CBC\"\n\n=== Logos ===\n<gallery heights=\"100\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:CBC logo 1940\u20131958.png|1940\u20131958\nFile:CBC Logo 1974-1986.svg|1974\u20131986\nFile:CBC Logo 1986-1992.svg|1986\u20131992\nFile:CBC Logo 1992-Present.svg|1992\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\nThe original logo of the CBC, designed by [[\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts (Montreal)|\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts]] student Hortense Binette<ref name=\"cbclogo\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/cbc-logo/ | publisher=CBC News | title=Retro revival: CBC's changing logo through the years}}</ref> and used between 1940 and 1958, featured a map of Canada (and from 1940 to 1949, [[Newfoundland (Dominion)|Newfoundland]]) and a thunderbolt design used to symbolize broadcasting.\n\nIn 1958, the CBC adopted a new logo for use at the end of network programs. Designed by scale model artist Jean-Paul Boileau, it consisted of the legends \"CBC\" and \"Radio-Canada\" overlaid on a map of Canada.  For French programming, the \"Radio-Canada\" was placed on top.\n\nThe \"Butterfly\" logo was designed for the CBC by Hubert Tison in 1966 to mark the network's progressing transition from black-and-white to colour television, much in the manner of the [[NBC logos|NBC peacock logo]]. It was used at the beginning of programs broadcast in colour, and was used until all CBC television programs had switched to colour. A sketch on the CBC Television program ''[[Wayne & Shuster]]'' once referred to this as the logo of the \"Cosmic Butterfly Corporation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVGJXuBY88 |title=YouTube \u2013 CBC Butterfly |via=YouTube |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth logo, known internally as \"the gem\", was designed for the CBC by graphic artist [[Burton Kramer]] in December 1974, and it is the most widely recognised symbol of the corporation. The main on-air [[Station identification|identification]] featured the logo kaleidoscopically morphing into its form while radiating outward from the centre of the screen on a blue background. This animated version, which went to air in December 1974, is also known colloquially as \"The Exploding Pizza\". The appearance of this logo marked the arrival of full-colour network television service. The large shape in the middle is the letter C, which stands for Canada, and the radiating parts of the C symbolize broadcasting. The original theme music for the 1974 CBC ident was a three-note woodwind orchestral fanfare accompanied by the voiceover \"This is CBC\" or \"Ici Radio-Canada\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bli95IO1izs |title=YouTube \u2013 RARE \u2013 Ici Radio-Canada \u2013 Musique diff\u00e9rente |via=YouTube |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> This was later replaced by a different, and more familiar 11-note woodwind orchestral jingle, which was used until December 31, 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_NEnBjYpI |title=YouTube \u2013 This is CBC 1982 |via=YouTube |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccca.concordia.ca/artists/image.html?languagePref=en&url=/c/images/big/k/kramerdesign/krad016.jpg&cright=Burton+Kramer+Design&mkey=52606&link_id=5490 |title=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation logo and television identification storyboard |publisher=Ccca.ca |date=March 15, 2001 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe updated one-colour version of the gem/pizza logo, created by Hubert Tison and Robert Innes,<ref name=\"cbclogo\" /> was introduced on January 1, 1986, and with it was introduced a new series of computer graphic-generated television idents for CBC and Radio-Canada. These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo, accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC's new, synthesized five-note jingle. The logo was changed to one colour, generally dark blue on white, or white on dark blue, in 1986. Print ads and most television promos, however, have always used a single-colour version of this logo since 1974.\n\nIn 1992, CBC updated its logo design to make it simpler and more red (or white on a red background). The new logo design, created by Swiss-Canadian design firm Gottschalk + Ash,<ref name=\"cbclogo\" /> reduces the number of geometric sections in the logo to 13 instead of the previous logo's 25, and the \"C\" in the centre of the logo became a simple red circle. According to graphic designer Todd Falkowsky, the logo's red colour also represents Canada in a symbolic way. With the launch of the current design, new television idents were introduced in November that year, also using CGI. Since the early 2000s, it has also appeared in white (sometimes red) on a textured or coloured background.

However, this supplementary funding has been repeated annually for a number of years. This combined total is just over a billion dollars annually and is a source of heated debate. To supplement this funding, the CBC's television networks and websites sell advertising, while cable/satellite-only services such as CBC News Network additionally collect subscriber fees, in line with their privately owned counterparts. CBC's radio services do not sell advertising except when required by law (for example, to political parties during federal elections).\n\nCBC's funding differs from that of the public broadcasters of many European nations, which collect a [[television licence|licence fee]], or those in the United States, such as [[PBS]] and [[NPR]], which receive some public funding but rely to a large extent on voluntary contributions from individual viewers and listeners. A Nanos Research poll from August 2014 conducted for Asper Media (National Post, Financial Post) showed 41% of Canadians wanted funding increased, 46% wanted it maintained at current levels, and only 10% wanted to see it cut.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Csanady  | first = Ashley  | title = Majority of Conservative voters like the CBC: poll  | website = Canada.com  | date = September 5, 2014  | url = http://o.canada.com/news/politics-and-the-nation/majority-of-conservative-voters-like-the-cbc-poll  | accessdate = May 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe network's defenders note that the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; that much of the public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks can fill up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost. CBC supporters also point out that additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canadian Media Guild]], the  $115-million deficit reduction action plan cuts to CBC which started with the 2012 budget and were fully realized in 2014, amounted to \"one of the biggest layoffs of content creators and journalists in Canadian history.\" The 2014 cuts combined with earlier ones totalled \"3,600 jobs lost at CBC since 2008.

CBC Radio One and Premi\u00e8re used to broadcast primarily on the [[AM radio|AM band]], but many stations have moved over to [[FM radio|FM]]. Over the years, a number of CBC radio transmitters with a majority of them on the AM band have either moved to FM or had shut down completely. \n{{further|List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada}}\n\nThe CBC plans to phase out more CBC AM transmitters across Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/_files/cbcrc/documents/submissions/long-range-radio-plan.pdf|title=CBC/Radio-Canada - Long Range Radio Plan|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> This goal however remains to be seen in light of the CBC budget cutbacks.\n\n===''Radio Guide''===\n\nBeginning in 1981, CBC radio launched the monthly magazine ''Radio Guide'', which included CBC Radio program listings alongside feature content, such as profiles of musicians and writers and behind the scenes looks at CBC programs.<ref>\"Ideas' producer has to be open to anything\".

The CBC is not subject to any conditions or expectations concerning its LRRP. The CBC noted that Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene (now Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re) and CBC Radio One were available to about 99 percent of the Canadian population. The CBC stated that it plans to maintain its radio service but has no plans to grow the coverage area. It described the LRRP as a planning vehicle and indicated that it would no longer use it. Given reductions in public funding to the CBC and given that Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene and Radio One are available to the vast majority of Canadians, the commission considers that the CBC's plan to maintain current coverage and discontinue the LRRP is reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission accepts the CBC's proposal to discontinue the LRRP.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-263.htm#bm275 Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-263], Availability of radio service, ''CRTC'', May 28, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other CBC Radio services===\nCBC Music and ''Ici musique'', found exclusively on FM, air arts and cultural programming, with a focus on music.

One, [[Radio Nord Qu\u00e9bec#Shortwave service|Radio Nord Qu\u00e9bec]], broadcast domestically to Northern Quebec on a static frequency of 9625 [[Kilohertz|kHz]], and the other, [[Radio Canada International]], provided broadcasts to the United States and around the world in eight languages.

The CRTC approved the subscription radio application, as well as two others for satellite radio service, on June 16, 2005. [[Sirius Canada]] launched on December 1, 2005, with a number of CBC Radio channels, including the new services [[CBC Radio 3]] and ''[[Bande \u00e0 part (radio)|Bande \u00e0 part]]''.\n\nIn some areas, especially national or provincial parks, the CBC also operates an [[AM radio|AM]] or [[FM radio|FM]] transmitter rebroadcasting weather alerts from the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]]'s [[Weatheradio Canada]] service.\n\n===Television===\n{{further|CBC Television|Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9}}\nThe CBC operates two national broadcast television networks; [[CBC Television]] in English, and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]] in French. Like private broadcasters, both those networks sell advertising, but offer more Canadian-produced programming. All CBC television stations are owned and operated by the CBC itself and carry a common schedule, aside from local programming and other [[regional variation]] (such as the [[CBC North]] stations in [[Nunavut]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and the [[Yukon]] carrying an additional newscast in the [[Inuktitut]] language and a weekly [[Cree language|Cree]] program), and [[CBET-DT]] in Windsor amending its non-primetime schedule at various points due to program rights conflicts with [[Detroit]] stations). \n\nBoth CBC's English and French networks previously had a number of private [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s owned by third-party owners. However, the majority of them have either been bought by the CBC and subsequently shut down during the transition to digital television, or have switched to other networks and program services. The only remaining privately-owned affiliate of any CBC-owned network is Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 affiliate [[CKRT-DT]] in [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]] (which is part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|triplestick]] also containing private affiliates for Quebec's two private networks).\n\nOne of the most popular shows is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] games. In English, the program is known as ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', and in French, it was called ''[[La Soir\u00e9e du hockey]]''. Both shows began in 1952. The French edition was discontinued in 2004, though Radio-Canada stations outside of Quebec simulcast some Saturday night games produced by [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]] until 2006.

Local newscasts were cut back to the bare minimum. This had the effect of delaying the debut of ''[[The Journal (Canadian TV show)|The Journal]]'', which had to wait until January 1982.\n\nOn August 15, 2005, 5,500 employees of the CBC (about 90%) were [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] by CBC CEO [[Robert Rabinovitch]] in a dispute over future hiring practices. At issue were the rules governing the hiring of contract workers in preference to full-time hires. The locked-out employees were members of the [[Canadian Media Guild]], representing all production, journalistic and on-air personnel outside [[Quebec]] and [[Moncton]], including several foreign correspondents. While CBC services continued during the lock-out, they were primarily made up of repeats, with news programming from the [[BBC]] and newswires. Major CBC programs such as ''The National'' and ''Royal Canadian Air Farce'' were not produced during the lock-out; some non-CBC-owned programs seen on the network, such as ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', shifted to other studios. Meanwhile, the locked-out employees produced podcasts and websites such as CBCunplugged.com.\n\nAfter a hiatus, talks re-opened. On September 23, [[Joe Fontana]], the federal minister of labour, called Robert Rabinovitch and Arnold Amber (the president of the CBC branch of the [[Canadian Media Guild]]) to his office for talks aimed at ending the dispute.\n\nLate in the evening of October 2, 2005, it was announced that the CBC management and staff had reached a tentative deal which resulted in the CBC returning to normal operations on October 11. Some speculated that the looming October 8 start date for the network's most important television property, ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', had acted as an additional incentive to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe CBC has been affected by a number of other labour disputes since the late 1990s:\n* In early 1999, CBC English- and French-network technicians in all locations outside Quebec and [[Moncton]], members of the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada]], went on strike.<ref>[http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/newsreleases/19990217.shtml CBC Position on CEP Strike Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304233622/http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/newsreleases/19990217.shtml |date=March 4, 2012 }}</ref> The [[Canadian Media Guild]] was set to strike as well, but the CBC settled with both unions.<ref>[http://www.playbackmag.com/articles/magazine/19990405/25116.html CEP, CMG ink deal with CBC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083757/http://www.playbackmag.com/articles/magazine/19990405/25116.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n* A similar dispute, again involving all technicians outside Quebec and Moncton, occurred in late 2001 and concluded by the end of the year.<ref>[http://www.cep.ca/press/cepnews_e.php?id=102 CBC Technicians' Lockout Ends &mdash; Collective agreement ratified by CEP membership] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005722/http://www.cep.ca/press/cepnews_e.php?id=102 |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n* In spring 2002, on-air staff in Quebec and Moncton (again, on both English and French networks) were locked out by local management, leaving, among other things, NHL playoff games without commentary on French television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-020603.html |title=North East RadioWatch: June 3, 2002 |publisher=Bostonradio.org |date=June 3, 2002 |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile all labour disputes resulted in cut-back programming and numerous repeat airings, the 2005 lock-out may have been the most damaging to CBC. All local programming in the affected regions was cancelled and replaced by abbreviated national newscasts and national radio morning shows. [[BBC World]] (television) and [[BBC World Service|World Service]] (radio) and [[The Canadian Press|Broadcast News]] feeds were used to provide the remainder of original news content, and the CBC website consisted mainly of rewritten wire copy. Some BBC staff protested against their material being used during the CBC lock-out. \"The [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] and [[Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union|BECTU]] will not tolerate their members' work being used against colleagues in Canada\", said a joint statement by BBC unions. The CMG questioned<ref>[http://www.cmg.ca/cbcnegsmediaEN.html#BBC BBC benefits on the backs of CBC employees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211002604/http://www.cmg.ca/cbcnegsmediaEN.html#BBC |date=December 11, 2005 }}</ref> whether, with its limited Canadian news content, the CBC was meeting its legal requirements under the [[Broadcasting Act (1968)|Broadcasting Act]] and its CRTC licences.\n\n[[Galaxie (radio)|Galaxie]] (which CBC owned at the time) supplied some music content for the radio networks. Tapes of aired or produced documentaries, interviews and entertainment programs were also aired widely. Selected television sports coverage, including that of the [[Canadian Football League]], continued, but without commentary.\n\nAs before, French-language staff outside of Quebec were also affected by the 2005 lock-out, although with Quebec producing the bulk of the French networks' programming, those networks were not as visibly affected by the dispute apart from local programs.\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n===Newsworld International and Trio===\nFrom 1994 to 2000, the CBC, in a venture with [[Power Corporation of Canada|Power Broadcasting]] (former owner of [[CKWS-TV|CKWS]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]), jointly owned two networks:\n\n# [[Newsworld International]] (NWI), an American cable channel that rebroadcast much of the programming of CBC Newsworld (now known as CBC News Network).\n# [[Trio channel|Trio]], an arts and entertainment channel.\n\nIn 2000, CBC and Power Broadcasting sold these channels to [[Barry Diller]]'s [[USA Networks]]. Diller's company was later acquired by [[Vivendi Universal]], which in turn was partially acquired by [[NBC]] to form [[NBC Universal]]. NBC Universal still owns the Trio brand, which no longer has any association with the CBC (and became an Internet-only broadband channel which was later folded into [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]].) The channel was shut down and was replaced with the NBC Universal channel Sleuth, which later became [[Cloo]].\n\nHowever, the CBC continued to program NWI, with much of its programming simulcast on the domestic Newsworld service. In late 2004, as a result of a further change in NWI's ownership to the [[INdTV]] consortium (including [[Joel Hyatt]] and former [[Vice-President of the United States]] [[Al Gore]]), NWI ceased airing CBC programming on August 1, 2005, when it became [[Current TV]]. Current later folded and became [[Al Jazeera America]] on August 20, 2013.\n\n===U.S. border audiences===\nIn U.S. border communities such as [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] and [[Seattle]], Washington; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York; [[Detroit]], Michigan and [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Vermont, CBC radio and television stations can be received [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and have a significant audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/sports/olympics/21cbc.html|title=Canadian TV switch displeases Americans|first=Joanne|last=Gerstner|work=The New York Times|date=February 20, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Farther from the border, some American fans of the network have acquired Canadian IP addresses to stream its sports broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/some-us-viewers-turn-to-cbc-amid-complaints-about-nbcs-olympic-coverage/article16790846/|title=Some U.S. viewers turn to CBC amid complaints about NBC's Olympic coverage|first=Cassandra|last=Szklarski|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Some CBC programming is also rebroadcast on local public radio, such as [[New Hampshire Public Radio]], [[Vermont Public Radio]] and the [[Maine Public Broadcasting Network]]. CBC television channels are available on cable systems located near the Canada\u2013U.S. border. For example, [[CBET-DT|CBET]] [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] is available on cable systems in the [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and [[Toledo, Ohio]], areas; much of the rest of the state of Michigan receives [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] [[Montreal]] on cable. [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] [[Vancouver]] is broadcast on [[Comcast]] in the [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], area. At night, the AM radio transmissions of both CBC and Radio-Canada services can be received over much of the northern portion of the United States, from stations such as [[CBW (AM)|CBW]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[CBK (AM)|CBK]] in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]] in [[Toronto]].\n\n===Carriage of CBC News===\nOn September 11, 2001, several American broadcasters without their own news operations, including [[C-SPAN]], carried the CBC's coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the days after September 11, C-SPAN carried CBC's nightly newscast, ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]]'', anchored by [[Peter Mansbridge]]. The quality of this coverage was recognised specifically by the [[Canadian Journalism Foundation]]; editor-in-chief [[Tony Burman]] later accepted the Excellence in Journalism Award (2004), for \"rigorous professional practice, accuracy, originality and public accountability\", on behalf of the service.\n\nC-SPAN has also carried CBC's coverage of major events affecting Canadians, including: [[Canadian federal election]]s, key proceedings in [[Parliament of Canada]], Six days in September 2000 that marked the [[death and state funeral of Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], the [[2003 North America blackout|power outage crisis]] in summer 2003, [[U.S. presidential election]]s (e.g. in [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004]], C-SPAN picked up ''The National'' the day after the election for the view from Canadians), state visits and official visits of [[President of United States|American presidents]] to Canada, and [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Barack Obama inauguration]] in 2009.\n\nSeveral [[PBS]] stations also air some CBC programming. However, these programs are syndicated by independent distributors, and are not governed by the PBS \"common carriage\" policy.\n\nOther American broadcast networks sometimes air CBC reports, especially for Canadian events of international significance. For example, in the early hours after the [[Swissair Flight 111]] disaster, [[CNN]] aired CBC's live coverage of the event. Also in the late 1990s, [[CNN Headline News]] aired a few CBC reports of events that were not significant outside Canada.\n\n===CBC Radio===\nSome CBC Radio One programs, such as ''[[Definitely Not the Opera]]'', ''[[WireTap]]'', ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', and ''[[As It Happens]]'', also air on some stations associated with [[American Public Media]] or [[Public Radio International]]. Some of the CBC's radio networks are available to [[Sirius XM Holdings|SiriusXM]] subscribers in the United States, including CBC Radio One (a special feed that exclusively contains CBC-produced content and no regional programs) and Premi\u00e8re (a simulcast of its Montreal flagship [[CBF-FM]]), CBC Radio 3, and music-oriented services exclusive to SiriusXM.\n\n===Caribbean and Bermuda===\nSeveral Caribbean nations carry feeds of CBC TV:\n* [[Bahamas]], on the coral wave (Cable Bahamas) television system in the Northern Bahamas (Channel 8).\n* [[Barbados]],\n**on the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation]] [[Multi-Choice TV (Barbados)|Multi-Choice TV]] Cable system (Channel 703), and\n**on the [[Columbus Communications]] owned cable system \"Flow Barbados\" (channel 132).\n* [[Bermuda]], on the CableVision digital cable service.\n* [[Grenada]], carried on [[Columbus Communications]] owned cable system ''Flow Grenada''.\n* [[Jamaica]], distributed in areas served by ''Flow Jamaica''.\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on the [[Columbus Communications]] Trinidad Ltd. (CCTL) television system.\n\n===Availability of CBC channels and programming===\nCBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, CBC News Network and all other CBC channels can be received through cable and satellite TV channel providers across Canada, like through [[Bell TV]], [[Rogers Cable]], [[Videotron]], [[Cogeco]], and other smaller TV providers. The CBC and Radio-Canada channel signals can also be obtained free of charge, over-the-air, through antenna receivers in Canada's largest markets or in some border states along the Canada-U.S. border; however, CBC is not obtainable as a \"[[free-to-air]]\" (FTA) channel on FTA satellites (signals are encrypted on the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] space satellites and require a dedicated satellite receiver).\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Closed captioning===\nCBC Television was an early leader in broadcasting programming with [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired, airing its first captioned programming in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1980s.shtml |title=CBC/RadioCanada\u2013History\u20131980s |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |accessdate=February 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628204745/http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1980s.shtml |archivedate=June 28, 2010 }}</ref> Captioned programming in Canada began with the airing of ''[[Clown White]]'' in English-language and French-language versions on CBC Television and Radio-Canada, respectively.

Broadcasters could either continue serving those markets by transitioning analogue transmitters to digital or cease broadcasting over-the-air. Cable, IPTV, and satellite services are not involved or affected by this digital transition deadline.\n\nWhile its fellow Canadian broadcasters converted most of their transmitters to digital by the [[Digital television in Canada|Canadian digital television transition]] deadline of August 31, 2011, CBC converted only about half of the analogue transmitters in mandatory to digital (15 of 28 markets with CBC TV, and 14 of 28 markets with SRC). Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published a plan whereby communities that receive analogue signals by re-broadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air (OTA) signals as of the deadline.  Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and SRC transmitters in mandatory markets.  Mandatory markets losing both CBC and SRC over-the-air signals include [[London, Ontario]] (metropolitan area population 457,000) and [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] (metro area 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not converted to digital.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, CBC shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters, following an announcement of these plans on April 4, 2012.  This reduced the total number of the corporation's television transmitters across the country to 27. According to the CBC, this would reduce the corporation's yearly costs by $10&nbsp;million. No plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both CBC and SRC in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter. In fact, in its CRTC application to shut down all of its analogue television transmitters, the CBC communicated its opposition to use of subchannels, citing, amongst other reasons, costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?DMID=1733163 |title=Re: Notice of Decommissioning of CBC/Radio-Canada\u2019s Analogue Television Rebroadcasting Transmitters \u2013 Reply argument of CBC/Radio-Canada |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref> CBC/R-C claims that only 1.7 percent of Canadian viewers actually lost access to CBC and Radio-Canada programming due to the very high penetration of cable and satellite.

Recorded and released as [[triple album]] in 1970, it was Harrison's first solo work after [[Break-up of the Beatles|the break-up of the Beatles]] in April that year. It includes the hit singles \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" and \"[[What Is Life]]\", as well as songs such as \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\" and [[All Things Must Pass (song)|the title track]] that had been turned down for inclusion on releases by [[the Beatles]]. The album reflects the influence of Harrison's musical activities with artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Band]], [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]] and [[Billy Preston]] during 1968\u201370, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. ''All Things Must Pass'' introduced Harrison's signature [[slide guitar]] sound and the spiritual themes present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two [[LP record|LPs]] of songs and a third disc of informal jams titled ''Apple Jam''. Several commentators interpret [[Barry Feinstein]]'s album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\n\nProduction began at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were [[Eric Clapton]] and members of Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band \u2013 three of whom formed [[Derek and the Dominos]] with Clapton during the recording \u2013 as well as [[Ringo Starr]], [[Gary Wright]], Preston, [[Klaus Voormann]], [[John Barham]], [[Badfinger]] and [[Pete Drake]]. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.\n\n''All Things Must Pass'' was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number one on charts worldwide. Co-producer [[Phil Spector]] employed his [[Wall of Sound]] production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the sound as \"[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]], [[Anton Bruckner|Brucknerian]], the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\".<ref name=RS1971>Ben Gerson, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-things-must-pass-19710121 \"George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''\"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 5 June 2013).</ref> Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] likened the album to [[Greta Garbo]]'s first role in a [[talking picture]] and declared: \"Garbo talks! \u2013 Harrison is free!\"<ref name=\"Schaffner, p. 140\"/> According to [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]], writing in the 2011 edition of his ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]'', ''All Things Must Pass'' is \"generally rated\" as the best of all the former Beatles' solo albums.<ref>Larkin, p. 2635.</ref>\n\nDuring the final year of his life, Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album's release. After this reissue, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certified the album six-times platinum. Among its appearances on critics' best-album lists, ''All Things Must Pass'' was ranked 79th on ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} \"The 100 Best Albums of All Time\" in 1993, while ''Rolling Stone'' placed it 433rd on the magazine's \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\". In 2014, ''All Things Must Pass'' was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Background==\nMusic journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] said [[George Harrison]]'s \"journey\" to making ''All Things Must Pass'' started when he visited America in late 1968, after the acrimonious sessions for [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]].<ref name=\"Harris p 68\">Harris, p. 68.</ref> At [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] in November,<ref>George Harrison, p. 164.</ref> Harrison started a long-lasting friendship with [[Bob Dylan]]<ref name=\"Harris p 68\" /> and experienced a creative equality with [[the Band]] that contrasted with [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]'s domination in the Beatles.<ref>Leng, pp. 39, 51\u201352.</ref><ref>Tillery, p. 86.</ref> He also wrote more songs,<ref name=\"Leng p 39\">Leng, p. 39.</ref> renewing his interest in the guitar after three years studying the Indian [[sitar]].<ref>George Harrison, pp. 55, 57\u201358.</ref><ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 176, 177, 184\u201385.</ref> As well as being one of the few musicians to co-write songs with Dylan,<ref name=\"Harris p 68\" /> Harrison had recently collaborated with [[Eric Clapton]] on \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\",<ref>Leng, pp. 39, 53\u201354.</ref> which became a hit single for [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in the spring of 1969.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/cream/ \"Artist: Cream\"], [[Official Charts Company]] (retrieved 16 January 2013).</ref>\n\n[[File:Wonderwall by George Harrison.jpg|thumb|left|upright|130px|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for Harrison's ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' soundtrack (1968)]]\nOnce back in London, and with his compositions continually overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles,<ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 1, 85, 124.</ref><ref>Martin O'Gorman, \"Film on Four\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)#Special editions|Mojo Special Limited Edition]]: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years \u2013 Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970)'', Emap (London, 2003), p. 73.</ref> Harrison found creative fulfilment in extracurricular projects that, in the words of his musical biographer, Simon Leng, served as an \"emancipating force\" from the restrictions imposed on him in the band.<ref>Leng, pp. 39, 55.</ref> His activities during 1969 included producing [[Apple Records|Apple]] signings [[Billy Preston]] and [[Doris Troy]], two American singer-songwriters whose [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] roots proved as influential on ''All Things Must Pass'' as the music of the Band.<ref>Leng, pp. 60\u201362, 71\u201372, 319.</ref> He also recorded with artists such as [[Leon Russell]]<ref>O'Dell, pp. 106\u201307.</ref> and [[Jack Bruce]],<ref>Rodriguez, p. 1.</ref> and accompanied Clapton on a short tour with [[Delaney Bramlett]]'s soul revue, [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]].<ref>Miles, pp. 351, 360\u201362.</ref> In addition, Harrison identified his involvement with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]] as providing \"another piece of a jigsaw puzzle\" that represented the spiritual journey he had begun in 1966.<ref>Clayson, pp. 206\u201308, 267.</ref> As well as embracing the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavist]] branch of [[Hinduism]], Harrison produced two hit singles during 1969\u201370 by the UK-based devotees, credited as [[Radha Krsna Temple|Radha Krishna Temple (London)]].<ref>Spizer, p. 341.</ref> In January 1970,<ref>Miles, p. 367.</ref> Harrison invited American producer [[Phil Spector]] to participate in the recording of Lennon's [[Plastic Ono Band]] single \"[[Instant Karma!]]\"<ref>Rodriguez, p. 21.</ref><ref>George Harrison, in ''[[George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]'' DVD, [[Village Roadshow]], 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese;

co-producer, who was convalescing in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" /> and Spector replied by letter dated 19 August with suggestions for further overdubs and final mixing.<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter p 427\" /> Among Spector's comments were detailed suggestions regarding \"Let It Down\",<ref name=\"Leng p 91\" /> the released recording of which Madinger and Easter describe as \"the best example of Spector running rampant with the 'Wall of Sound'\", and an urging that he and Harrison carry out further work on the songs at the superior, [[16-track]] Trident Studios facility.<ref>Madinger & Easter, pp. 427, 429.</ref> Spector then returned to oversee conversion of the 8-track recordings to 16-track masters,<ref name=\"Clayson p 289\" /> a process that allowed for more freedom when overdubbing new instruments.<ref name=\"Spizer p 222\" />\n\nJohn Barham's orchestrations were recorded during the next phase of the album's production,<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter

(the latter credited to \"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\").<ref>Spizer, pp. 212, 222.</ref> Leng recognises Barham's arrangements on \"pivotal\" songs such as \"Isn't It a Pity\", \"My Sweet Lord\", \"Beware of Darkness\" and \"All Things Must Pass\" as important elements of the album's sound,<ref name=\"Leng p 78\" /> while Spector has praised Harrison's guitar and vocal work on the overdubs,

likens ''All Things Must Pass'' to \"the sound of Harrison exhaling\", noting: \"He was quite possibly the only Beatle who was completely satisfied with the Beatles being gone.\"<ref name=\"PopMatters

as well as helping bring about the [[dream pop]] phenomenon.<ref name=\"PopMatters review 135411\" /> Another ''Rolling Stone'' critic, James Hunter, commented in 2001 on how ''All Things Must Pass'' \"helped define the decade it ushered in\", in that \"the cast, the length, the long hair falling on suede-covered shoulders&nbsp;... foretold the sprawl and sleepy ambition of the Seventies.\"<ref>James Hunter, \"George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass'' 30th Anniversary reissue\", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 29 March 2001; quoted in The Super Seventies \"Classic 500\",

that the album is exceptional, but \"a tad overrated\" by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise \"a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once\".<ref>Brackett & Hoard, p. 367.</ref> Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of ''Apple Jam'' as \"a very significant flaw\", while recognising that its content \"proved to be of immense musical importance\", with the formation of Derek and the Dominos.<ref name=Allmusic/> Writing for [[Pitchfork Media]] in 2016, Jayson Green said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who \"changed the terms of what an album could be\" since, although ''All Things Must Pass'' was not the first rock triple LP, \"in the cultural imagination, it is ''the'' first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement.\"<ref name=\"Greene/Pitchfork\" />\n\nAmong Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng views ''All Things Must Pass'' as a \"paradox of an album\": as eager as Harrison was to break free from his identity as a Beatle, Leng suggests, many of the songs document the \"[[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] chain of events\" of life within the band and so added to the \"mythologized history\" he was looking to escape.<ref>Leng, pp. 76, 103.</ref> Ian Inglis notes 1970's place in an era marking \"the new supremacy of the singer-songwriter\", through such memorable albums as [[Simon &

the Canyon]]'', but that none of these \"possessed the startling impact\" of ''All Things Must Pass''.<ref name=\"Inglis p 23\" /> Harrison's triple album, Inglis writes, \"[would] elevate 'the third

Recorded and released as [[triple album]] in 1970, it was Harrison's first solo work after [[Break-up of the Beatles|the break-up of the Beatles]] in April that year. It includes the hit singles \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" and \"[[What Is Life]]\", as well as songs such as \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\" and [[All Things Must Pass (song)|the title track]] that had been turned down for inclusion on releases by [[the Beatles]]. The album reflects the influence of Harrison's musical activities with artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Band]], [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]] and [[Billy Preston]] during 1968\u201370, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. ''All Things Must Pass'' introduced Harrison's signature [[slide guitar]] sound and the spiritual themes present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two [[LP record|LPs]] of songs and a third disc of informal jams titled ''Apple Jam''. Several commentators interpret [[Barry Feinstein]]'s album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\n\nProduction began at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October.

The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.\n\n''All Things Must Pass'' was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number one on charts worldwide.
