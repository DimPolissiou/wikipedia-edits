They have long, thin legs; a pointy, downward curving bill; and a brush-like tipped tongue. Adult males are covered in brown feathers, have red crowns and under parts; a black mask around their eyes; and white throats. Females and younger chats are colored similarly, but with paler markings. The males are usually more brightly colored than females, specifically during the breeding season in order to attract a mate.\n\n==='''Similar species'''===\nA bird species similar to and often confused with the crimson chat is the male [[red-capped robin]], whose scientific name is ''Petroica goodenovii''. However, there are three main differences between their characteristics. A male crimson chat has crimson crown and underparts, white throat and a yellow eye; whereas the red-capped robin has a black body with crimson chest and cap, white wing marks and a dark eye. Also, the crimson chat's bill is thinner and longer than the robin's. When a crimson chat is seen, a saltbush, ''Spinifex'', or mulga can usually be found nearby, as they are plants often associated with this species. According to relevant Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only significant threat is being killed by predators.'''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nCrimson chats can be found in deserts, semi-arid regions, woodlands, grasslands and coastal shrublands in the central part of Australia from the west coast to the Great Dividing Range and from the tropics to the south coast. Generally, they tend to inhabit areas on the fringes of wet regions, where it is more dry. They live in various types of shrubland: saltbush, bluebush, acacia and samphire. They move to wetter areas when rainfall is insufficient, which means that there are not enough nutrients produced for the birds to consume. Flocks of crimson chats may wander over a wide area around their range in order to track rain. This nomadic movement helps them find the best flowers and nectar. However, chats do not follow routine seasonal migrations.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[Image:Crimson Chat female.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n\n===Diet===\nCrimson chats eat insects and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs, and they can use their brush-like tongue to extract nectar or take seeds from flowers close to the ground. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground.\n\n===Breeding===\nCrimson chats are found in small flocks and go in pairs throughout the breeding season and the rest of the year. Chats have a long breeding season from August to November and a shorter period after the rain season from March to April. These flocks form clusters of nests, which are defended by both the male and female chats. Most calls are soft, metallic twangs (\u2018dik it - dik it\u2019) or high pitched whistles (like \u2018see\u2019 or 'seet'). When agitated they make a chattering sound (a quick \u2018check - check\u2019), which is where their name originates.\n\nIn this species, both sexes help build a nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground. It is usually made with grass, rootlets, hair, feathers and twigs. The female lays 2 to 5 pink and white, brown-red spotted eggs, approximately 1\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd inch) in length and width. Both parents help incubate the eggs for around two weeks and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. If a predator comes near the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest. Predators include cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds like ravens.\n\n<tt>==Summary of Facts concerning the Crimson Chat==</tt><br />'''Minimum Size:''' 11&nbsp;cm<br />'''Maximum Size:''' 13&nbsp;cm<br />'''Average Size:''' 12&nbsp;cm<br />'''Minimum Weight:''' 9 g<br />'''Maximum Weight:''' 12 g<br />'''Average Weight:''' 10.5 g<br />'''Breeding Season:''' August to October (or any time after rain)<br />'''Clutch Size:''' 2 to 4<br />'''Incubation:''' 14 days<br />'''Time in Nest:''' 14 days<br />'''Egg Size:''' 17x14&nbsp;mm\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Honeyeaters and Australian Chats.\"Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. 1st ed. 2003.\n* Perrins, Christopher. \"Australian Chats.\"Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World. 3rd ed. 1979.\n* \"Australian Chats: Epthianuridae.\" 21 Dec 2003. 13 Dec 2006 [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Australian_chats.html].\n* \"Australian Chat.\" Ebsco Animals.

Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the Airline), Rafael Palacio, Crist\u00f3bal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and [[German people|Germans]] Wilhem Schnurbusch, Werner K\u00e4merer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called ''Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes A\u00e9reos'' or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight between Barranquilla and the nearby town of [[Puerto Colombia]] using a [[Junkers F.13]], transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed [[monoplane]]s, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of {{convert|850|km|0|abbr=on}} which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the [[Junkers]] aircraft to make [[water landing]]s in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on 20 October 1920, following the course of the [[Magdalena River]]; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\n\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, [[Financial capital|capital]] and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining [[concession (contract)|concessions]] from the Colombian government to operate the country's [[airmail]] transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in [[Venezuela]] and the [[United States]]. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned [[Pan American World Airways]].\n\n===National Airways of Colombia (1940\u20131994)===\n[[File:Avianca Boeing 747-259B (M); EI-CEO@MIA, June 1993 (5659668614).jpg|thumb|Avianca Boeing 747 at Miami International Airport in 1993.]]\nOn 14 June 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline [[SACO (Colombia)|SACO]] ([[acronym and initialism|acronym]] of '''''S'''ervicio '''A'''\u00e9reo '''Co'''lombiano''), forming the new '''''A'''ero'''v\u00eda'''s '''N'''acionales de '''C'''olombi'''a''' S.A.'' or '''Avianca'''. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael Mar\u00eda Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as [[Germany|German]] citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Mart\u00edn del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA's history as its own.\n\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to [[Quito]], [[Lima]], [[Panama City]], [[Miami]], New York City and [[Europe]], using [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[C-54 Skymaster]]s. In 1951, Avianca acquired [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed 749 Constellations]] and [[Lockheed Constellation|1049 Super Constellations]]. In 1961, Avianca leased two [[Boeing 707]] aircraft, to operate its international routes and on 2 November 1961, it acquired its own [[Boeing 707|Boeing 720]]s. In 1976, Avianca became the first [[Latin America]]n airline to continuously operate{{Clarify|date=December 2014}} a [[Boeing 747]]. Three years later, it started operations with another 747, this time a [[Boeing 747|747 Combi]], mixing cargo and passenger operations.\n\n===Merger and alliance (1994\u20132002)===\n[[File:Avianca Boeing 767-200ER Dallimonti.jpg|thumb|Avianca Boeing 767 in 2004.]]\n[[File:Avianca Airbus A330-243 Bogota PAOC.jpg|thumb|Avianca [[Airbus A330-200]] at [[El Dorado International Airport]] in 2009.]]\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier [[SAM Colombia|SAM]] and the helicopter operator [[Helicol]] merged, beginning Avianca's new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet, made up of [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200s]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300s]], [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200s]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-83]]s, [[Fokker 50]]s, and [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] helicopters.\n\nBy 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\n\n===Summa Alliance (2002\u201304)===\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], Avianca, the regional carrier [[SAM Colombia]], and its major rival [[ACES Colombia]] joined efforts to create Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on 20 May 2002. In November 2003, Alianza Summa was disbanded and ACES Colombia was liquidated altogether and SAM Colombia was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca's brand.\n\n===American Continent Airways (2004\u201309)===\nOn 10 December 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the [[Brazil]]ian consortium, [[OceanAir]]/[[Synergy Group]] and the [[Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia|National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]], allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\n\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and [[VIP Ecuador]]. The company's full legal name was changed from ''Aerov\u00edas Nacionales de Colombia'' (National Airways of Colombia) to ''Aerov\u00edas del Continente Americano'' (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. In 2009, OceanAir and VIP were re-branded as [[Avianca Brazil]] and [[Avianca Ecuador]], respectively.\n\n===Avianca-TACA merger (2009\u201313)===\nIn 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with [[TACA Airlines|TACA]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Avianca confirms 'strategic merger' with TACA|date= 10 July 2009|publisher= Flightglobal|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/07/333194/avianca-confirms-strategic-merger-with-taca.html|accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8296256.stm|title=Latin American airlines to merge|date = 8 October 2009|accessdate = 12 December 2014|website = BBC|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> This created AviancaTaca Holdings, which instantly became one of the region's largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\n\nIn November 2009, the airline's Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its [[Fokker 50]] and [[Fokker 100]] aircraft with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/13018/fabio-villegas-avianca-replace-fokker-jets|title=Avianca looking to replace Fokkers 100|publisher=Eturbonews.com|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> On 1 January 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 aircraft in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318 leased from [[GE Capital Aviation Services|GECAS]].

Colombians Ernesto Cortissoz Alvarez-Correa (the first President of the Airline), Rafael Palacio, Crist\u00f3bal Restrepo, Jacobo Correa and Aristides Noguera and [[German people|Germans]] Wilhem Schnurbusch, Werner K\u00e4merer, Stuart Hosie and Albert Tietjen founded the Colombo-German Company, called ''Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes A\u00e9reos'' or SCADTA. The company accomplished their first flight between Barranquilla and the nearby town of [[Puerto Colombia]] using a [[Junkers F.13]], transporting 57 pieces of mail. The flight was piloted by German Helmuth von Krohn. This and another aircraft of the same type were completely mechanically constructed [[monoplane]]s, the engines of which had to be modified to efficiently operate in the climate of the country. There were nine aircraft in the fleet with a total range of {{convert|850|km|0|abbr=on}} which could carry up to four passengers and two crewmen. Due to the topographic characteristics of the country and the lack of airports at the time, floats were adapted for two of the [[Junkers]] aircraft to make [[water landing]]s in the rivers near different towns. Using these floats, Helmuth von Krohn was able to perform the first inland flight over Colombia on 20 October 1920, following the course of the [[Magdalena River]]; the flight took eight hours and required four emergency landings in the water.\n\nSoon after the airline was founded, German scientist and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] Peter von Bauer became interested in the airline and contributed general knowledge, [[Financial capital|capital]] and a tenth aircraft for the company, as well as obtaining [[concession (contract)|concessions]] from the Colombian government to operate the country's [[airmail]] transportation division using the airline, which began in 1922. This new contract allowed SCADTA to thrive in a new frontier of aviation. By the mid-1920s, SCADTA started its first international routes that initially covered destinations in [[Venezuela]] and the [[United States]]. In 1924, the aircraft that both Ernesto Cortissoz and Helmuth von Krohn were flying crashed into an area currently known as Bocas de Ceniza in Barranquilla, killing them. In the early 1940s, Peter von Bauer sold his shares in the airline to the US-owned [[Pan American World Airways]].\n\n===National Airways of Colombia (1940\u20131994)===\n[[File:Avianca Boeing 747-259B (M); EI-CEO@MIA, June 1993 (5659668614).jpg|thumb|Avianca Boeing 747 at Miami International Airport in 1993.]]\nOn 14 June 1940, in the city of Barranquilla, SCADTA, under ownership by United States businessmen, merged with regional Colombian airline [[SACO (Colombia)|SACO]] ([[acronym and initialism|acronym]] of '''''S'''ervicio '''A'''\u00e9reo '''Co'''lombiano''), forming the new '''''A'''ero'''v\u00eda'''s '''N'''acionales de '''C'''olombi'''a''' S.A.'' or '''Avianca'''. Five Colombians participated in this: Rafael Mar\u00eda Palacio, Jacobo A. Corea, Cristobal Restrepo, and Aristides Noguera, as well as [[Germany|German]] citizens Albert Teitjen, Werner Kaemerer and Stuart Hosie, while the post of first President of Avianca was filled by Mart\u00edn del Corral. Avianca claims SCADTA's history as its own.\n\nIn 1946, Avianca began flights to [[Quito]], [[Lima]], [[Panama City]], [[Miami]], New York City and [[Europe]], using [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[C-54 Skymaster]]s. In 1951, Avianca acquired [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed 749 Constellations]] and [[Lockheed Constellation|1049 Super Constellations]]. In 1961, Avianca leased two [[Boeing 707]] aircraft, to operate its international routes and on 2 November 1961, it acquired its own [[Boeing 707|Boeing 720]]s. In 1976, Avianca became the first [[Latin America]]n airline to continuously operate{{Clarify|date=December 2014}} a [[Boeing 747]]. Three years later, it started operations with another 747, this time a [[Boeing 747|747 Combi]], mixing cargo and passenger operations.\n\n===Merger and alliance (1994\u20132002)===\n[[File:Avianca Boeing 767-200ER Dallimonti.jpg|thumb|Avianca Boeing 767 in 2004.]]\n[[File:Avianca Airbus A330-243 Bogota PAOC.jpg|thumb|Avianca [[Airbus A330-200]] at [[El Dorado International Airport]] in 2009.]]\nIn 1994, Avianca, the regional carrier [[SAM Colombia|SAM]] and the helicopter operator [[Helicol]] merged, beginning Avianca's new system of operations. This arrangement allowed for specialized services in cargo (Avianca Cargo) and postal services, as well as a more modern fleet, made up of [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200s]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300s]], [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200s]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-83]]s, [[Fokker 50]]s, and [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] helicopters.\n\nBy 1996, Avianca Postal Services became Deprisa, which provided various mail services.\n\n===Summa Alliance (2002\u201304)===\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], Avianca, the regional carrier [[SAM Colombia]], and its major rival [[ACES Colombia]] joined efforts to create Alianza Summa, which began merged operations on 20 May 2002. In November 2003, Alianza Summa was disbanded and ACES Colombia was liquidated altogether and SAM Colombia was acquired to be a regional carrier under Avianca's brand.\n\n===American Continent Airways (2004\u201309)===\nOn 10 December 2004, Avianca concluded a major reorganization process, undertaken after filing for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection, by obtaining confirmation of its reorganization plan, which was financially backed by the [[Brazil]]ian consortium, [[OceanAir]]/[[Synergy Group]] and the [[Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia|National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]], allowing the airline to obtain funds for US$63 million, in the 13 months following withdrawal from bankruptcy.\n\nUnder this plan, Avianca was bought by Synergy Group, and was consolidated with its subsidiaries OceanAir and [[VIP Ecuador]]. The company's full legal name was changed from ''Aerov\u00edas Nacionales de Colombia'' (National Airways of Colombia) to ''Aerov\u00edas del Continente Americano'' (Airways of the American Continent), retaining the acronym Avianca. In 2009, OceanAir and VIP were re-branded as [[Avianca Brazil]] and [[Avianca Ecuador]], respectively.\n\n===Avianca-TACA merger (2009\u201313)===\nIn 2009, it was announced that Avianca would merge with [[TACA Airlines|TACA]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Avianca confirms 'strategic merger' with TACA|date= 10 July 2009|publisher= Flightglobal|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/07/333194/avianca-confirms-strategic-merger-with-taca.html|accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8296256.stm|title=Latin American airlines to merge|date = 8 October 2009|accessdate = 12 December 2014|website = BBC|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> This created AviancaTaca Holdings, which instantly became one of the region's largest airlines, with 129 aircraft and flights to more than 100 destinations.\n\nIn November 2009, the airline's Chief Executive Fabio Villegas announced that the airline was looking to replace its [[Fokker 50]] and [[Fokker 100]] aircraft with newer aircraft of 100 seats or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/13018/fabio-villegas-avianca-replace-fokker-jets|title=Avianca looking to replace Fokkers 100|publisher=Eturbonews.com|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> On 1 January 2011, the airline decided to retire the Fokker 100 aircraft in 2011 and replace them with 10 Airbus A318 leased from [[GE Capital Aviation Services|GECAS]].

As of 2017 Avianca operates the second-most daily international flights from Miami with 16, second only to American Airlines.\n\nIn August 2018, Avianca had some operational difficulties due to problems with the platform it used to assign crew schedules.
