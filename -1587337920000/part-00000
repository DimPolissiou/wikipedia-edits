After two failed attempts in the early 1910s, the city decided to take matters into its own hands and in 1916 chartered a railroad. The line opened in 1918. After struggling early on, the railroad eventually was able to gain new customers in the sawmills that opened up near Prineville to take advantage of the recently opened timber of the [[Ochoco Mountains]] east of the city.  In 1939, two significant events took place on the COP. First, the railroad was able to finally turn its first profit and second, the railroad terminated its passenger service, which had been declining since the early 1920s. The railroad joined the diesel age in 1950 when it purchased its first diesel locomotive, and in 1955 it scrapped the last of its steam locomotives. \n\nThe railroad stabilized in the 1960s and 1970s with four sawmills as customers, but by the 1990s and 2000s, the railroad lost revenue when the final two mills being served shut down, leaving the COP with only inbound lumber loads for the Woodgrain Millworks facility. In 2004, business picked back up when the railroad built a [[transload facility]] out of an abandoned sawmill. This facility had garnered the attention of [[Louisiana Pacific]] (LP) who used it to receive wood for laminated beams and ship out completed beams. Both the raw goods received and the finished product would be shipped by truck either to or from an LP facility in [[Hines, Oregon|Hines]]. While this did help the COP, it would turn out to be short lived as LP eventually had to close the Hines plant.

After two failed attempts in the early 1910s, the city decided to take matters into its own hands and in 1916 chartered a railroad. The line opened in 1918. After struggling early on, the railroad eventually was able to gain new customers in the sawmills that opened up near Prineville to take advantage of the recently opened timber of the [[Ochoco Mountains]] east of the city.  In 1939, two significant events took place on the COP. First, the railroad was able to finally turn its first profit and second, the railroad terminated its passenger service, which had been declining since the early 1920s.

Originally, the name ''Jyllandsposten'' (in one word) was used, the hyphen being adopted in 1945. The current name was introduced in 1969. It also refers to itself as \"Denmark's joke newspaper\".\n\n''Jyllandsposten'' quickly became one of [[Jutland]]'s most modern newspapers and secured an exclusive access to government [[telegraph]] wires between 21:00 and midnight every day. This enabled ''Jyllandsposten'' to publish news one day earlier than most of its competitors. Gradually the paper expanded, enlarging its format and adding more and more pages. The first issues had only contained four pages. In 1889 it abandoned the traditional [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script in favour of the [[Latin script]] used today. Gothic script had been abolished by the Danish spelling reform of 1875, but was still in wide use.\n\nPolitically the paper supported the ''[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|H\u00f8jre]]'' (\"Right\") party &ndash; which became the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] in 1915. The paper advocated business interests and strongly opposed [[socialism]]. It was also critical of business monopolies.<ref name=\"history1871\">{{cite web|title=JP historie 1871 - 1917 |author=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/jps-historie/1871-1917/ |language=da |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125557/http://jyllands-posten.dk/jps-historie/1871-1917/ |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn international affairs, it was generally supportive of Britain and critical of Germany, which it considered the only country that \"wished to attack Denmark,\" to quote an 1872 edition. This nationalist sentiment was a reaction to Germany's annexation of large portions of southern Jutland following the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Editorially the newspaper supported the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority in Germany]] and advocated for a new border located at the [[Danevirke]]. Throughout [[World War I]] ''Jyllands-Posten'' continued its verbal attacks on Germany despite the government's policy of neutrality in the conflict. In 1918, the newspaper was outlawed in Germany.<ref name=\"history1871\" />\n\n===1920s\u20131930s===\nIn 1929, the paper established an office in Copenhagen, and established a corporation with ''[[The Times]]''. In 1931, the paper was acquired by a joint stock company whose main investor became editor-in-chief. In 1934 the newspaper began to use photographs in its layouts. Foreign news stories were supplied by [[Ritzau]], ''The Times'', and the ''Daily Telegraph''.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the editorial line of the paper was right-wing Conservative. The paper expressed its sympathy for a number of conservative issues, most notably increasing the size of the Danish military, which had experienced a massive cut in funds by the Social Democratic government. Another issue was support of the Danish minority in Germany. The paper expressed its admiration for the authoritarian regimes of Italy and Germany on several occasions, a line assumed by many European newspapers.\n\nIn 1922, the newspaper expressed its admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]], who had just assumed office: ''The very strong man, that Mussolini undoubtedly is, is exactly what the misruled Italian people need''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bj\u00f8rn Pedersen|year=2005|title=Kampen om demokratiet 1930-45|url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/temaer/angrebdemokrati/demokratiopfattelse/|language=da|access-date=29 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220020232/http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/temaer/angrebdemokrati/demokratiopfattelse/|archive-date=20 February 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1933, the newspaper advocated that Denmark follow Germany's example and replace petty party politics with the stability of an authoritarian regime. The paper considered the German Weimar republic to be a failure because of its lack of stability, and was sympathetic to [[Adolf Hitler]]s coming to power and the shutting down of democratic institutions. In March 1933, the paper wrote: ''Only dry tears will be cried at the grave of the Weimar Republic ... As odd as it may sound, the only 12-year-old German constitution with its one-chamber-system, its low electoral age\u201420 years\u2014and proportional representation is already antiquated.'' The editorial of 17 May 1933, stated that ''... democratic rule by the people, as we know it, is a luxury which can be afforded in good times when the economy is favorable.

But still, it can not be denied, that the experiences which the Germans\u2014as many other continental peoples\u2014have had with regards to the Jews, form a certain basis for their persecution.

The paper states: ''JP in this period turned itself firmly against [[the Soviet Union]] and [[world communism]], while still maintaining a distance towards Germany, especially with its demands for a strengthened Danish military, and its support for the Danish minority in [[Southern Schleswig]].

In 1971, the paper bought out the joint stock company controlling it, and it has since been owned by a foundation. In the 1980s, the newspaper gradually increased its number of foreign correspondents, until finally stationing more than 20 journalists around the world.\n\nIn 1982, ''Jyllands-Posten'''s Sunday edition became the largest Sunday paper in Denmark.

However, it has been criticized as being anti-migrant after a few controversial incidents.\n\nIn 2002 the Danish Council of the Press, criticised the newspaper for breaching its regulations on race while reporting on three Somalis charged with a crime.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Retsinfo.dk, [http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOC_/ACCN/W20020910125-afgrTARGET= Kendelse fra Pressen\u00e6vnet i sag nr. 23/2002], 20 March 2002.</ref> The relevant regulation was: \"Any mention of family relations, occupation, race, nationality, faith or relationship to an organisation ought to be avoided, unless this has a direct relevance to the case,\"\n\n''Jyllands-Posten'' published a story alleging asylum fraud by resident [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] refugees in Denmark. This contributed to the electoral success of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 20 November 2001, whose political party campaigned for reduced immigration. The story was found to be unsupported and resulted in the sacking of the editor-in-chief Ulrik Haagerup on 12 December 2001 (''[[Politiken]]'', ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', [[Dagbladet Information|Information]], [[BT (tabloid)|''B.T.'']], 13 December 2001). However, ''Jyllands-Posten'' maintained that the dismissal of Haagerup had nothing to do with his responsibility for the articles in question (editorial on 16 December 2001). According to ''[[Weekendavisen]]'', a newspaper that pretty much shares the political line of ''Jyllands-Posten'', the real reason for Haagerup's dismissal was a disagreement about the employment strategy (21 December 2001).\n\nThe 2004 report on Denmark by the [[European Network Against Racism]] (ENAR), an organisation of [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] funded partly by the [[European Commission]], concluded that the Danish media devoted an excessive proportion of their time to the problems posed by immigrants, and most often Islamic immigrants, while often ignoring the problems that these immigrants face. According to the ENAR report, out of 382 JP articles on immigrants, 212 were negative, a share similar to other Danish newspapers. The ENAR report holds newspapers such as ''Jyllands-Posten'' to blame for the rise of the anti-immigrant right-wing in Danish politics.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Bashy Ouraishy|authorlink1=Bashy Quraishy|author2=Jean O'Connor|url=http://www.enar-eu.org/en/national/Denmark2004_enOK.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325023310/http://www.enar-eu.org/en/national/Denmark2004_enOK.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2006|title=Enar Shadow Report 2004 Denmark|work=Enar|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nA journalist employed at ''Jyllands-Posten'' won a second prize in 2005 in an EU wide competition for journalists for diversity and against discrimination.

Originally, the name ''Jyllandsposten'' (in one word) was used, the hyphen being adopted in 1945. The current name was introduced in 1969. It also refers to itself as \"Denmark's joke newspaper\".\n\n''Jyllandsposten'' quickly became one of [[Jutland]]'s most modern newspapers and secured an exclusive access to government [[telegraph]] wires between 21:00 and midnight every day. This enabled ''Jyllandsposten'' to publish news one day earlier than most of its competitors. Gradually the paper expanded, enlarging its format and adding more and more pages. The first issues had only contained four pages. In 1889 it abandoned the traditional [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script in favour of the [[Latin script]] used today. Gothic script had been abolished by the Danish spelling reform of 1875, but was still in wide use.\n\nPolitically the paper supported the ''[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|H\u00f8jre]]'' (\"Right\") party &ndash; which became the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] in 1915. The paper advocated business interests and strongly opposed [[socialism]]. It was also critical of business monopolies.<ref name=\"history1871\">{{cite web|title=JP historie 1871 - 1917 |author=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/jps-historie/1871-1917/ |language=da |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125557/http://jyllands-posten.dk/jps-historie/1871-1917/ |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn international affairs, it was generally supportive of Britain and critical of Germany, which it considered the only country that \"wished to attack Denmark,\" to quote an 1872 edition. This nationalist sentiment was a reaction to Germany's annexation of large portions of southern Jutland following the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Editorially the newspaper supported the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority in Germany]] and advocated for a new border located at the [[Danevirke]]. Throughout [[World War I]] ''Jyllands-Posten'' continued its verbal attacks on Germany despite the government's policy of neutrality in the conflict. In 1918, the newspaper was outlawed in Germany.<ref name=\"history1871\" />\n\n===1920s\u20131930s===\nIn 1929, the paper established an office in Copenhagen, and established a corporation with ''[[The Times]]''. In 1931, the paper was acquired by a joint stock company whose main investor became editor-in-chief. In 1934 the newspaper began to use photographs in its layouts. Foreign news stories were supplied by [[Ritzau]], ''The Times'', and the ''Daily Telegraph''.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the editorial line of the paper was right-wing Conservative. The paper expressed its sympathy for a number of conservative issues, most notably increasing the size of the Danish military, which had experienced a massive cut in funds by the Social Democratic government. Another issue was support of the Danish minority in Germany. The paper expressed its admiration for the authoritarian regimes of Italy and Germany on several occasions, a line assumed by many European newspapers.\n\nIn 1922, the newspaper expressed its admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]], who had just assumed office: ''The very strong man, that Mussolini undoubtedly is, is exactly what the misruled Italian people need''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bj\u00f8rn Pedersen|year=2005|title=Kampen om demokratiet 1930-45|url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/temaer/angrebdemokrati/demokratiopfattelse/|language=da|access-date=29 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220020232/http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/temaer/angrebdemokrati/demokratiopfattelse/|archive-date=20 February 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1933, the newspaper advocated that Denmark follow Germany's example and replace petty party politics with the stability of an authoritarian regime. The paper considered the German Weimar republic to be a failure because of its lack of stability, and was sympathetic to [[Adolf Hitler]]s coming to power and the shutting down of democratic institutions. In March 1933, the paper wrote: ''Only dry tears will be cried at the grave of the Weimar Republic ... As odd as it may sound, the only 12-year-old German constitution with its one-chamber-system, its low electoral age\u201420 years\u2014and proportional representation is already antiquated.''

But still, it can not be denied, that the experiences which the Germans\u2014as many other continental peoples\u2014have had with regards to the Jews, form a certain basis for their persecution.

The paper states: ''JP in this period turned itself firmly against [[the Soviet Union]] and [[world communism]], while still maintaining a distance towards Germany, especially with its demands for a strengthened Danish military, and its support for the Danish minority in [[Southern Schleswig]].

In the 1980s, the newspaper gradually increased its number of foreign correspondents, until finally stationing more than 20 journalists around the world.\n\nIn 1982, ''Jyllands-Posten'''s Sunday edition became the largest Sunday paper in Denmark.

This contributed to the electoral success of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 20 November 2001, whose political party campaigned for reduced immigration. The story was found to be unsupported and resulted in the sacking of the editor-in-chief Ulrik Haagerup on 12 December 2001 (''[[Politiken]]'', ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', [[Dagbladet Information|Information]], [[BT (tabloid)|''B.T.'']], 13 December 2001). However, ''Jyllands-Posten'' maintained that the dismissal of Haagerup had nothing to do with his responsibility for the articles in question (editorial on 16 December 2001). According to ''[[Weekendavisen]]'', a newspaper that pretty much shares the political line of ''Jyllands-Posten'', the real reason for Haagerup's dismissal was a disagreement about the employment strategy (21 December 2001).\n\nThe 2004 report on Denmark by the [[European Network Against Racism]] (ENAR), an organisation of [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] funded partly by the [[European Commission]], concluded that the Danish media devoted an excessive proportion of their time to the problems posed by immigrants, and most often Islamic immigrants, while often ignoring the problems that these immigrants face. According to the ENAR report, out of 382 JP articles on immigrants, 212 were negative, a share similar to other Danish newspapers.
