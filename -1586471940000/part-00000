It was designed to fill a gap in payload capacities between the [[Long March 3A]] and [[Long March 3B|3B]].\n\n==Launches==\nIt made its maiden flight on 25 April 2008, at 15:35 UTC. The payload for the first launch was the [[Tianlian-1]] data relay [[communications satellite]]. The second carried the [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|Compass-G2]] navigation satellite and was conducted on 14 April 2009. The third launch was made on 16 January 2010, with the [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|Compass-G1]] satellite. The fourth carrying the [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|Compass-G3]] navigation satellite was launched on 2 June 2010. On 1 October 2010, it successfully launched China's second lunar probe, [[Chang'e 2]].\n\nAn enhanced version of the Long March 3C rocket debuted during the launch of [[Chang'e 5-T1]] on 23 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barbosa|first1=Rui C.|title=China launches lunar sample return test mission|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/10/china-lunar-sample-return-test-mission/|publisher=[[NASASpaceflight.com]]|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> On 30 March 2015, the [[Yuanzheng-1]] upper stage was used on top of a Long March 3C rocket for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barbosa|first1=Rui C.|title=Long March 3C in secretive launch with new Upper Stage |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/03/long-march-3c-launch-new-upper-stage/|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==List of launches==\n{{main|List of Long March launches}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!--border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0.5em 0em 0.5em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"-->\n|----- style=\"background:#FFDEAD;\"\n!

The station is owned by the McBride family and their Fort Myers Broadcasting Company, making it one of a handful of TV stations today to have locally-based ownership. Fort Myers Broadcasting also operates three Naples-licensed stations under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA) with owner Sun Broadcasting: [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WXCW]] (channel 46), [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVF-LD]] (channel 2), and low-powered [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] affiliate [[WANA-LD]] (channel 18). The four stations share studios on Palm Beach Boulevard ([[Florida State Road 80|SR 80]]) in northeast Fort Myers; WINK-TV's transmitter is located north of [[Fort Myers Shores, Florida|Fort Myers Shores]], near the [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte]]\u2013[[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] county line. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is carried on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 5 and in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on [[digital cable|digital]] channel 433.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting on March 23, 1954, owned by the family of taxicab magnate and [[Cleveland Browns]] founder [[Arthur B. McBride|Mickey McBride]] along with WINK radio (1240 AM, now [[WAXA]] at 1200 AM; and [[WINK-FM|96.9 FM]]). WINK-TV was the first television station in [[Southwest Florida]] and is the fifth-oldest surviving station in the state. Although the call letters appear to be an outgrowth of its CBS affiliation, in fact they were simply carried over from its radio sister, which adopted them in 1944\u2014seven years before the [[CBS#Logos|CBS Eye]] made its first appearance.<ref>[http://www.winknews.com/about Station history]</ref> It carried programming from the four major networks of its era: CBS, [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] in the first two decades of its existence. However, it has always been a primary CBS affiliate.\n\nChannel 11 lost DuMont when that network ended operations in 1956. In December 1968, WINK-TV finally gained a local competitor when [[WBBH-TV]] signed on and took the NBC affiliation. The two stations continued to share ABC until WEVU-TV (now [[WZVN-TV]]) signed on in 1974. However, viewers could watch the full ABC and NBC schedules via stations from [[Miami]]\u2013[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]\u2013[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], which were and continue to be available with outdoor antennas.\n\nWINK-TV was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve [[very high frequency|VHF]] channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.\n\nAfter the FCC's ''Sixth Report and Order'' ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one noncommercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (\"1/2\") would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as \"UHF islands\" since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The \"2\" networks became CBS and NBC, \"+1\" represented [[non-commercial educational]] stations, and \"1/2\" became ABC (which was the weakest network then usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available).\n\nHowever, Fort Myers is sandwiched between Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale (channels [[WPBT|2]], [[WFOR-TV|4]], [[WTVJ|6]], [[WSVN|7]] and [[WPLG|10]]) and West Palm Beach (channels [[WPTV-TV|5]] and [[WPEC|12]]) to the east and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] (channels [[WEDU|3]], [[WFLA-TV|8]], [[WTSP|10]], and [[WTVT|13]]) to the north. This created a large doughnut in southwest Florida where there could be only ''one'' VHF license. WINK-TV was fortunate to gain that license, and as a result was the only local station that provided a clear picture to outlying portions of the market until cable television arrived in the mid-1970s. Although there was no station on channel 9 in the immediate area, it was occupied in [[WFTV|Orlando]], which was too close to Fort Myers to reallocate.\n\nThe station has identified almost exclusively with its call letters since the mid-1980s. This is due in large part to the extremely high penetration of cable and [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] in Southwest Florida\u2014one of the highest in the nation.

The station is owned by the McBride family and their Fort Myers Broadcasting Company, making it one of a handful of TV stations today to have locally-based ownership. Fort Myers Broadcasting also operates three Naples-licensed stations under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA) with owner Sun Broadcasting: [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WXCW]] (channel 46), [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVF-LD]] (channel 2), and low-powered [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] affiliate [[WANA-LD]] (channel 18). The four stations share studios on Palm Beach Boulevard ([[Florida State Road 80|SR 80]]) in northeast Fort Myers; WINK-TV's transmitter is located north of [[Fort Myers Shores, Florida|Fort Myers Shores]], near the [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte]]\u2013[[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] county line. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is carried on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 5 and in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on [[digital cable|digital]] channel 433.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting on March 23, 1954, owned by the family of taxicab magnate and [[Cleveland Browns]] founder [[Arthur B. McBride|Mickey McBride]] along with WINK radio (1240 AM, now [[WAXA]] at 1200 AM; and [[WINK-FM|96.9 FM]]). WINK-TV was the first television station in [[Southwest Florida]] and is the fifth-oldest surviving station in the state. Although the call letters appear to be an outgrowth of its CBS affiliation, in fact they were simply carried over from its radio sister, which adopted them in 1944\u2014seven years before the [[CBS#Logos|CBS Eye]] made its first appearance.<ref>[http://www.winknews.com/about Station history]</ref> It carried programming from the four major networks of its era: CBS, [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] in the first two decades of its existence. However, it has always been a primary CBS affiliate.\n\nChannel 11 lost DuMont when that network ended operations in 1956. In December 1968, WINK-TV finally gained a local competitor when [[WBBH-TV]] signed on and took the NBC affiliation. The two stations continued to share ABC until WEVU-TV (now [[WZVN-TV]]) signed on in 1974. However, viewers could watch the full ABC and NBC schedules via stations from [[Miami]]\u2013[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]\u2013[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], which were and continue to be available with outdoor antennas.\n\nWINK-TV was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve [[very high frequency|VHF]] channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.\n\nAfter the FCC's ''Sixth Report and Order'' ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one noncommercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (\"1/2\") would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as \"UHF islands\" since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The \"2\" networks became CBS and NBC, \"+1\" represented [[non-commercial educational]] stations, and \"1/2\" became ABC (which was the weakest network then usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available).\n\nHowever, Fort Myers is sandwiched between Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale (channels [[WPBT|2]], [[WFOR-TV|4]], [[WTVJ|6]], [[WSVN|7]] and [[WPLG|10]]) and West Palm Beach (channels [[WPTV-TV|5]] and [[WPEC|12]]) to the east and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] (channels [[WEDU|3]], [[WFLA-TV|8]], [[WTSP|10]], and [[WTVT|13]]) to the north. This created a large doughnut in southwest Florida where there could be only ''one'' VHF license. WINK-TV was fortunate to gain that license, and as a result was the only local station that provided a clear picture to outlying portions of the market until cable television arrived in the mid-1970s. Although there was no station on channel 9 in the immediate area, it was occupied in [[WFTV|Orlando]], which was too close to Fort Myers to reallocate.\n\nThe station has identified almost exclusively with its call letters since the mid-1980s. This is due in large part to the extremely high penetration of cable and [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] in Southwest Florida\u2014one of the highest in the nation. Cable and satellite are all but essential for acceptable television reception in much of the market, even in the digital age.\n\nOn October 20, 2007, WINK-TV became the first television station in [[Southwest Florida]] to begin broadcasting in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In January 2008, several programming changes were made on WINK-TV.

Pushkin wrote the story in autumn 1833 in [[Boldino]],<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 424.</ref> and it was first published in the literary magazine {{transl|ru|Biblioteka dlya chteniya}} in March [[1834 in literature|1834]].<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nThe story was the basis of the operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1890) by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], {{lang|fr|La dame de pique}} (1850) by [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy]] and {{lang|de|[[Pique Dame (Supp\u00e9)|Pique Dame]]}} (1864) by [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]]<ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2005/10/the_operatic_pu.php The Operatic Pushkin].</ref> (the overture to the Supp\u00e9 work is all that remains in today's repertoire). It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]], who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage |title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated) |last=Pushkin |first=Alexander |date=2013-11-17 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=9781908909688 |language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Corwell |first=Neil |date=2002-01-01 |title=\"You've heard of the Count Saint-Germain ...\" \u2014in Pushkin's 'The Queen of Spades' and Far Beyond |jstor=40922261 |journal=New Zealand Slavonic Journal |pages=49\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe card game of [[Faro (card game)|faro]] also plays an important role in Pushkin's story. The game is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, burning the first (known as \"soda\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bicyclecards.ca/game-rules/faro/9.php?page_id=32 |title=Playing Cards, Card Games and Rules, Games and Family Fun from Bicycle |website=www.bicyclecards.ca |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Reality vs. the supernatural ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f 74 \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438.JPG|thumb|240px|Graffiti in [[Kharkiv]], 2008]]\nAccording to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Pushkin\u2019s tale represents \u201cthe pinnacle of the art of the fantastic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book |title=F.\u00a0M.

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost\u2019s intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann\u2019s mistake with the last card.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann\u2019s final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosenshield |first=Gary |date=1994-01-01 |title=Choosing the Right Card: Madness, Gambling, and the Imagination in Pushkin's \"The Queen of Spades\" |jstor=462967 |journal=PMLA |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=995\u20131008 |doi=10.2307/462967}}</ref>\n\nOther critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Nathan |date=1975-01-01 |title=The Magic Cards in The Queen of Spades |jstor=306284 |journal=The Slavic and East European Journal |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=255\u2013275 |doi=10.2307/306284}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://feb-web.ru/feben/pushkin/serial/v36/v36-074-.htm |author=Vinogradov |title=Stil' \"Pikovoi damy\" |date=1936 |website=feb-web.ru |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> This explanation focuses on Pushkin\u2019s quote in the story that \u201cTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\u201d Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace.\n\nIn contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pushkiniana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200:clayton-articles1213&catid=133&Itemid=256|title=\"The Queen of Spades\": A Seriously Intended Joke / \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a|last=Douglas|first=Clayton, J.|website=The Pushkin Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> \n\nA reading of ''The Queen of Spades'' holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German Cultural Presence in Russia|last=Barabtarlo|first=Gennady|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811885|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Avarice ===\nRosenshield describes Pushkin\u2019s Queen of Spades as an \u201ceternal tale of gambling and avarice\u201d.<ref>Gregg, Richard. \u201cGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'\u201d. ''The Slavonic and East European Review'' 78.4 (2000): 612\u2013624.</ref> In the story, Hermann becomes obsessed by gambling, even before the Countess grants him her secret to the cards. According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann\u2019s fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul.<ref>Rosen, Nathan. \"The Magic Cards in the Queen of Spades\". ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 19.3 (1975): 255\u2013275.</ref> Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann\u2019s avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her \u201cinjured innocence\u201d to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann\u2019s \u201cdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene\u201d when he trespasses into the Countess\u2019 room and causes her death.<ref>Rosenshield, Gary. Pushkin and the Genres of Madness: The Masterpieces of 1833. Madison, WI: U of Wisconsin, 2003. Print.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nPushkin uses metapoetic moments throughout the story to question the reliability of the narrator and to discern the genre of the work. These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form.

Pushkin wrote the story in autumn 1833 in [[Boldino]],<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 424.</ref> and it was first published in the literary magazine {{transl|ru|Biblioteka dlya chteniya}} in March [[1834 in literature|1834]].<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nThe story was the basis of the operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1890) by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], {{lang|fr|La dame de pique}} (1850) by [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy]] and {{lang|de|[[Pique Dame (Supp\u00e9)|Pique Dame]]}} (1864) by [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]]<ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2005/10/the_operatic_pu.php The Operatic Pushkin].</ref> (the overture to the Supp\u00e9 work is all that remains in today's repertoire). It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]], who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage |title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated) |last=Pushkin |first=Alexander |date=2013-11-17 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=9781908909688 |language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Corwell |first=Neil |date=2002-01-01 |title=\"You've heard of the Count Saint-Germain ...\" \u2014in Pushkin's 'The Queen of Spades' and Far Beyond |jstor=40922261 |journal=New Zealand Slavonic Journal |pages=49\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe card game of [[Faro (card game)|faro]] also plays an important role in Pushkin's story. The game is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, burning the first (known as \"soda\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bicyclecards.ca/game-rules/faro/9.php?page_id=32 |title=Playing Cards, Card Games and Rules, Games and Family Fun from Bicycle |website=www.bicyclecards.ca |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Reality vs. the supernatural ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f 74 \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438.JPG|thumb|240px|Graffiti in [[Kharkiv]], 2008]]\nAccording to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Pushkin\u2019s tale represents \u201cthe pinnacle of the art of the fantastic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book |title=F.\u00a0M.

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost\u2019s intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann\u2019s mistake with the last card.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann\u2019s final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosenshield |first=Gary |date=1994-01-01 |title=Choosing the Right Card: Madness, Gambling, and the Imagination in Pushkin's \"The Queen of Spades\" |jstor=462967 |journal=PMLA |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=995\u20131008 |doi=10.2307/462967}}</ref>\n\nOther critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Nathan |date=1975-01-01 |title=The Magic Cards in The Queen of Spades |jstor=306284 |journal=The Slavic and East European Journal |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=255\u2013275 |doi=10.2307/306284}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://feb-web.ru/feben/pushkin/serial/v36/v36-074-.htm |author=Vinogradov |title=Stil' \"Pikovoi damy\" |date=1936 |website=feb-web.ru |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> This explanation focuses on Pushkin\u2019s quote in the story that \u201cTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\u201d Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace.\n\nIn contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pushkiniana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200:clayton-articles1213&catid=133&Itemid=256|title=\"The Queen of Spades\": A Seriously Intended Joke / \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a|last=Douglas|first=Clayton, J.|website=The Pushkin Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> \n\nA reading of ''The Queen of Spades'' holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German Cultural Presence in Russia|last=Barabtarlo|first=Gennady|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811885|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Avarice ===\nRosenshield describes Pushkin\u2019s Queen of Spades as an \u201ceternal tale of gambling and avarice.\u201d<ref>Gregg, Richard. \u201cGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'\u201d.

According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann\u2019s fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul.<ref>Rosen, Nathan. \"The Magic Cards in the Queen of Spades.\" ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 19.3 (1975): 255-75. Web.</ref> Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann\u2019s avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her \u201cinjured innocence\u201d to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann\u2019s \u201cdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene\u201d when he trespasses into the Countess\u2019 room and causes her death.<ref>Rosenshield, Gary.

Print.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nPushkin uses metapoetic moments throughout the story to question the reliability of the narrator and to discern the genre of the work. These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of ''The Queen of Spades''.<ref name=\":1\" /> A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Adaptations ==\nOne of the most notable adaptations of The Queen of Spades was a film produced by [[Anatole de Grunwald]] completed in 1949.

In the 1920s, [[Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] had movies released. Their presence in literary history led to them becoming among the most famous horror film icons. These films have had numerous sequels and remakes made, each one varying in success.\n\nIn the 1940s, sequels to [[Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] were released, and when ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) was released a new horror icon had rose to prominence, the [[werewolf]]. In the 1950s, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' led to the [[Gill-man]] becoming an icon.

[[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' went on to become a horror icon.

The same type of mask was used on [[Jason Voorhees]] in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', and on one of the killers in ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]''. In 1978, the influential [[horror film]] ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' introduced the iconic [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]].\n\n===1980\u2013present===\nOne of the earliest 1980s horror icon is [[Jason Voorhees]] from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' franchise. Jason is featured in all of the films, as the killer or the motivation for the killings. [[Freddy Krueger]] from the hugely influential ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' franchise instantly became an icon. [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] from [[Hellraiser]] and Tarman, a zombie from ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' went on to become icons due to their unique designs. [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] from ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' went on to become an icon.

(Image features, [[Bela Lugosi]], as [[Count Dracula]] from the 1931 English language film, ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' as part of what would later be known as Universals 30s horror cycle, or [[Universal Classic Monsters|Universal Monsters]].)]]\nOne of the earliest horror icons in film date back to 1913 with ''[[The Werewolf (1913 film)|The Werewolf]]'', which is one of the earliest werewolf films. In the 1920s, [[Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] had movies released. Their presence in literary history led to them becoming among the most famous horror film icons. These films have had numerous sequels and remakes made, each one varying in success.\n\nIn the 1940s, sequels to [[Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] were released, and when ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) was released a new horror icon had rose to prominence, the [[werewolf]]. In the 1950s, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' led to the [[Gill-man]] becoming an icon. Another well known horror icon is [[Norman Bates]] from the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]].\n\n===1970s===\nMany modern horror icons originate from the 1970s. [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' went on to become a horror icon. The Phantom from ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' became an influential on some [[antagonist]] in many other horror films with the sack mask he wears. The same type of mask was used on [[Jason Voorhees]] in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', and on one of the killers in ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]''. In 1978, the influential [[horror film]] ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' introduced the iconic [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]].\n\n===1980\u2013present===\nOne of the earliest 1980s horror icon is [[Jason Voorhees]] from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' franchise. Jason is featured in all of the films, as the killer or the motivation for the killings. [[Freddy Krueger]] from the hugely influential ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' franchise instantly became an icon. [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] from [[Hellraiser]] and Tarman, a zombie from ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' went on to become icons due to their unique designs. [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] from ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' went on to become an icon. Some of the more notable horror icons from the 1990s, include [[Hannibal Lecter]], [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]] and [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Real people===\n====Writers====\n* [[Stephen King]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen King's Desperation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/352027/Stephen-King-s-Desperation/overview|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>\n* [[H.

They are also referred to as the '''Original Seven''' and '''Astronaut Group 1'''. Their names were publicly announced by [[NASA]] on April 9, 1959.  These seven original American astronauts were [[Scott Carpenter]], [[Gordon Cooper]], [[John Glenn]], [[Gus Grissom]], [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]]. The Mercury Seven created a new profession in the United States, and established the image of the American astronaut for decades to come.\n\nAll of the Mercury Seven eventually flew in space. They piloted the six spaceflights of the Mercury program that had an astronaut on board from May 1961 to May 1963, and members of the group flew on all of the NASA human spaceflight programs of the 20th century \u2013 Mercury, [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], and the [[Space Shuttle]]. Shepard became the first American to enter space in 1961, and later walked on the Moon on [[Apollo 14]] in 1971. Grissom flew Mercury and Gemini missions, but died in 1967 in the [[Apollo 1]] fire; the others all survived past retirement from service. Schirra flew [[Apollo 7]], the first Apollo mission, in Grissom's place. Slayton, grounded with an [[atrial fibrillation]], ultimately flew on the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975. Glenn became the first American in orbit in 1962, and flew on the {{OV|Discovery|full=nolink}} in 1998 to become, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space. He was the last living member of the Mercury Seven when he died in 2016 at the age of 95.\n\n== Background ==\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public. The Soviets followed up with [[Sputnik 2]], which carried [[Laika]], a [[Soviet space dog]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}} American intelligence analysts assessed that the Soviets planned to put a man into orbit, which caused the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) to strengthen their efforts to achieve that goal.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=69\u201374}}{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe USAF launched a spaceflight project called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS), for which it obtained approval from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and requested $133&nbsp;million in funding.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=9\u201310}} MISS encountered technical challenges, which  in turn caused funding difficulties. This generated conflict with the two agencies that should have been supporting it, NACA and the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA).{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=91\u201393}} The core of the problem was the USAF's inability to articulate a clear military purpose for MISS.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nMeanwhile, in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], the [[President of the United States]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], decided to create a new civilian agency, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), which would absorb NACA and be responsible for the overall direction of the American space program.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=82}} In September 1958, the USAF agreed to transfer responsibility for MISS to NASA, which was established on October 1, 1958.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=11\u201312}} On November 5, the [[Space Task Group]] (STG) was established at the NASA [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], with [[Robert R. Gilruth]] as its director. On November 26, 1958, NASA Administrator [[T. Keith Glennan]] and his deputy, [[Hugh Dryden]], adopted a suggestion by [[Abe Silverstein]], the director of Space Flight Development at STG, that the human spaceflight project be called [[Project Mercury]]. The name was publicly announced by Glennan on December 17, 1958, the 55th anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' first flight.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=131\u2013132}} The objective of Project Mercury was to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]], return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}}\n\n== Selection criteria ==\nThe STG had to decide on a name for the people who would fly into space. A brainstorming session was held on December 1, 1958. By analogy with \"aeronaut\" (air traveler), someone came up with the term \"[[astronaut]]\", which meant \"star traveler\", although Project Mercury's ambitions were far more limited. They thought that they had coined a new word, but the term had been used in science fiction since the 1920s.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=29\u201330}} A three-man panel consisting of [[Charles J. Donlan]], [[Warren J. North]] and [[Allen O. Gamble]] drew up a [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] job specification for astronauts. The panel proposed that astronauts be in civil service grades 12 to 15, depending on qualifications and experience, with an annual salary of $8,330 to $12,770 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|8330|1959|fmt=c}} to ${{Inflation|US|12770|1959|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=129}} It described the duties of an astronaut:{{quote|Although the entire satellite operation will be possible, in the early phases, without the presence of man, the astronaut will play an important role during the flight. He will contribute by monitoring the cabin environment and by making necessary adjustments. He will have continuous displays of his position and attitude and other instrument readings, and will have the capability of operating the reaction controls, and of initiating the descent from orbit. He will contribute to the operation of the communications system. In addition, the astronaut will make research observations that cannot be made by instruments; these include physiological, astronomical and meteorological observations.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=130}} }}\n\nAlthough the panel considered that many people might possess the required skills&nbsp;\u2013 aircraft pilots, submariners, deep sea divers and mountain climbers were all considered likely prospects&nbsp;\u2013 it decided that they could be best met by military [[test pilot]]s.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=34}}  Accepting only military test pilots would simplify the selection process, and would also satisfy security requirements, as the role would almost certainly involve the handling of classified information.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=129}} The decision to restrict selection to military test pilots was taken by Glennan, Dryden and Gilruth in the last week of December 1958, but the irony of using military test pilots in a civilian program was not overlooked, and in view of the President's express preference for a space program outside the military, Glennan thought it best to run the decision past Eisenhower. A meeting was arranged with the President, who was convinced by the arguments.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=130}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nThe panel also drew up selection criteria. Astronauts had to be:\n# Less than  40 years old;\n# Less than {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} tall;\n# In excellent physical condition;\n# With a [[bachelor's degree]] or equivalent;\n# A graduate of test pilot school;\n# With a minimum of 1,500 hours total flying time; and\n# A qualified jet pilot.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=131}}\n\nThe height limit was a function of the design of the [[Mercury spacecraft]], which could not accommodate someone taller.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=35}} It was still uncertain as to whether piloting in the conventional sense would ever be possible in a spacecraft,{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=131}} but from the beginning the spacecraft design provided for some degree of manual control.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=38}}\n\n== Selection process ==\n[[File:Mercury Seven astronauts with aircraft.jpg|thumb|The Mercury Seven in front of an [[F-106 Delta Dart]]]]\nThe first step in the selection process was to obtain the service records of test pilot school graduates from the [[United States Department of Defense]]. All services agreed to cooperate fully, and handed over their records. There were 508 military test pilots in total, of whom 225 were Air Force, 225 [[United States Navy|Navy]], 23 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and 35 [[United States Army|Army]]. Donlan, North, Gamble and psychologist Robert B. Voas then went through the records in January 1959, and identified 110 pilots&nbsp;\u2013 five Marines, 47 from the Navy, and 58 from the Air Force&nbsp;\u2013 who met the rest of the minimum standards.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201339}} The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=38}}\n\nSixty-nine candidates were brought to [[the Pentagon]] in Washington, DC, in two groups.<ref name=\"time19590420\" /> The first group of 35 assembled there on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], while the Air Force officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the space program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed the candidates on Project Mercury. The officials conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe candidates were given three briefings by NASA officials. The first was about NASA and Project Mercury; the second concerned the role of the pilot in the project; and the third was about the proposed astronaut training syllabus. In the afternoon candidates had short individual meetings with the NASA selection committee. It was emphasized that participation was entirely voluntary, that candidates were free to decline, and that there would be no career repercussions if they did so. Several candidates declined at this point.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe rest reported to NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, the following day for further screening. Voas gave them a series of [[standardized test]]s: the [[Miller Analogies Test]] to measure [[IQ]]; the Minnesota Engineering Analogies Test to measure engineering aptitude; and the Doppelt Mathematical Reasoning Test to measure mathematical aptitude. Donlan, North and Gamble conducted interviews in which they asked technical questions, and queried candidates about their motivations for applying to the program. Candidates were evaluated by two USAF psychiatrists, George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy. A USAF [[flight surgeon]], William S. Augerson, went over the candidates' medical records. Some were found to be over the height limit, and were eliminated at this juncture.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates: 15 from the Navy, 15 from the Air Force and two from the Marine Corps.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=57\u201358}} Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}}{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThen came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]] from January to March, under the direction of Albert H. Schwichtenberg, a retired USAF [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=43\u201347}} The tests included spending hours on [[treadmill]]s and [[tilt table]]s, submerging their feet in ice water, three doses of [[castor oil]], and five [[enema]]s.<ref name=\"time19590420\" />{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=16}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Astronaut Selection |work=Project Mercury Overview |publisher=NASA |date=November 30, 2006 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/astronaut.html#.VLKiV3vAuJw |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> Only one candidate, [[Jim Lovell]], was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, a diagnosis that was later found to be in error;{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations. Gilruth found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}}\n\nDespite their rejection from the first group of astronauts, many of the 25 finalists who were passed still had successful military careers. Three eventually became astronauts: [[Pete Conrad]] and Jim Lovell, who were selected with [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|the next group]] in 1962; and [[Edward Givens]], who was selected with the [[NASA Astronaut Group 5|fifth group]] in 1966.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=284\u2013285}} Others achieved high rank: [[Lawrence Heyworth Jr.]] became a [[rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]], [[Robert B.

The Astronaut Office, which was headed by Shepard, was one of three divisions in the Directorate of Flight Crew Operations, which was headed by Slayton. Since twenty-six of the first thirty astronauts were military personnel, the Astronaut Office had a military character, although few of the astronauts wore their uniforms even as much as once a year.{{sfn|Cunningham|2009|pp=40\u201343}} There was a bi-weekly military-style pilots' meeting at which activities planned for the upcoming two weeks would be discussed.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=168\u2013169}} A \"[[captain's mast]]\" was held afterwards to adjudicate disputes.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nShepard ran the Astronaut Office on a \"rank has its privileges\" basis.{{sfn|Cunningham|2009|pp=40\u201343}} The Mercury and 1962 astronauts had their own allocated parking spaces outside Building 4 at [[Johnson Space Center]], while astronauts from later groups had to compete for the remaining spaces allotted to astronauts.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=113\u2013114}} While Shepard prohibited junior astronauts from receiving gifts and consulting or teaching part-time, he remained vice president and part owner of the Baytown National Bank in Houston, and devoted much of his time to it.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|p=83}}\n\nTraining was always ungraded; the Mercury astronauts had nothing to gain and much to lose from being objectively compared to the newer classes, as it could threaten their privileged status, managerial control, and priority for flight assignments.

They are also referred to as the '''Original Seven''' and '''Astronaut Group 1'''. Their names were publicly announced by [[NASA]] on April 9, 1959.  These seven original American astronauts were [[Scott Carpenter]], [[Gordon Cooper]], [[John Glenn]], [[Gus Grissom]], [[Wally Schirra]], [[Alan Shepard]], and [[Deke Slayton]]. The Mercury Seven created a new profession in the United States, and established the image of the American astronaut for decades to come.\n\nAll of the Mercury Seven eventually flew in space. They piloted the six spaceflights of the Mercury program that had an astronaut on board from May 1961 to May 1963, and members of the group flew on all of the NASA human spaceflight programs of the 20th century \u2013 Mercury, [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], and the [[Space Shuttle]]. Shepard became the first American to enter space in 1961, and later walked on the Moon on [[Apollo 14]] in 1971. Grissom flew Mercury and Gemini missions, but died in 1967 in the [[Apollo 1]] fire; the others all survived past retirement from service. Schirra flew [[Apollo 7]], the first Apollo mission, in Grissom's place. Slayton, grounded with an [[atrial fibrillation]], ultimately flew on the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975. Glenn became the first American in orbit in 1962, and flew on the {{OV|Discovery|full=nolink}} in 1998 to become, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space. He was the last living member of the Mercury Seven when he died in 2016 at the age of 95.\n\n== Background ==\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public. The Soviets followed up with [[Sputnik 2]], which carried [[Laika]], a [[Soviet space dog]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}} American intelligence analysts assessed that the Soviets planned to put a man into orbit, which caused the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) to strengthen their efforts to achieve that goal.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=69\u201374}}{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe USAF launched a spaceflight project called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS), for which it obtained approval from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and requested $133&nbsp;million in funding.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=9\u201310}} MISS encountered technical challenges, which  in turn caused funding difficulties. This generated conflict with the two agencies that should have been supporting it, NACA and the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA).{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=91\u201393}} The core of the problem was the USAF's inability to articulate a clear military purpose for MISS.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nMeanwhile, in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], the [[President of the United States]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], decided to create a new civilian agency, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), which would absorb NACA and be responsible for the overall direction of the American space program.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=82}} In September 1958, the USAF agreed to transfer responsibility for MISS to NASA, which was established on October 1, 1958.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=11\u201312}} On November 5, the [[Space Task Group]] (STG) was established at the NASA [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], with [[Robert R. Gilruth]] as its director. On November 26, 1958, NASA Administrator [[T. Keith Glennan]] and his deputy, [[Hugh Dryden]], adopted a suggestion by [[Abe Silverstein]], the director of Space Flight Development at STG, that the human spaceflight project be called [[Project Mercury]]. The name was publicly announced by Glennan on December 17, 1958, the 55th anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' first flight.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=131\u2013132}} The objective of Project Mercury was to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]], return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}}\n\n== Selection criteria ==\nThe STG had to decide on a name for the people who would fly into space. A brainstorming session was held on December 1, 1958. By analogy with \"aeronaut\" (air traveler), someone came up with the term \"[[astronaut]]\", which meant \"star traveler\", although Project Mercury's ambitions were far more limited. They thought that they had coined a new word, but the term had been used in science fiction since the 1920s.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=29\u201330}} A three-man panel consisting of [[Charles J. Donlan]], [[Warren J. North]] and [[Allen O. Gamble]] drew up a [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] job specification for astronauts. The panel proposed that astronauts be in civil service grades 12 to 15, depending on qualifications and experience, with an annual salary of $8,330 to $12,770 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|8330|1959|fmt=c}} to ${{Inflation|US|12770|1959|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=129}} It described the duties of an astronaut:{{quote|Although the entire satellite operation will be possible, in the early phases, without the presence of man, the astronaut will play an important role during the flight. He will contribute by monitoring the cabin environment and by making necessary adjustments. He will have continuous displays of his position and attitude and other instrument readings, and will have the capability of operating the reaction controls, and of initiating the descent from orbit. He will contribute to the operation of the communications system. In addition, the astronaut will make research observations that cannot be made by instruments; these include physiological, astronomical and meteorological observations.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=130}} }}\n\nAlthough the panel considered that many people might possess the required skills&nbsp;\u2013 aircraft pilots, submariners, deep sea divers and mountain climbers were all considered likely prospects&nbsp;\u2013 it decided that they could be best met by military [[test pilot]]s.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=34}}  Accepting only military test pilots would simplify the selection process, and would also satisfy security requirements, as the role would almost certainly involve the handling of classified information.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=129}} The decision to restrict selection to military test pilots was taken by Glennan, Dryden and Gilruth in the last week of December 1958, but the irony of using military test pilots in a civilian program was not overlooked, and in view of the President's express preference for a space program outside the military, Glennan thought it best to run the decision past Eisenhower. A meeting was arranged with the President, who was convinced by the arguments.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=130}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nThe panel also drew up selection criteria. Astronauts had to be:\n# Less than  40 years old;\n# Less than {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} tall;\n# In excellent physical condition;\n# With a [[bachelor's degree]] or equivalent;\n# A graduate of test pilot school;\n# With a minimum of 1,500 hours total flying time; and\n# A qualified jet pilot.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=131}}\n\nThe height limit was a function of the design of the [[Mercury spacecraft]], which could not accommodate someone taller.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=35}} It was still uncertain as to whether piloting in the conventional sense would ever be possible in a spacecraft,{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=131}} but from the beginning the spacecraft design provided for some degree of manual control.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=38}}\n\n== Selection process ==\n[[File:Mercury Seven astronauts with aircraft.jpg|thumb|The Mercury Seven in front of an [[F-106 Delta Dart]]]]\nThe first step in the selection process was to obtain the service records of test pilot school graduates from the [[United States Department of Defense]]. All services agreed to cooperate fully, and handed over their records. There were 508 military test pilots in total, of whom 225 were Air Force, 225 [[United States Navy|Navy]], 23 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and 35 [[United States Army|Army]]. Donlan, North, Gamble and psychologist Robert B. Voas then went through the records in January 1959, and identified 110 pilots&nbsp;\u2013 five Marines, 47 from the Navy, and 58 from the Air Force&nbsp;\u2013 who met the rest of the minimum standards.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201339}} The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=38}}\n\nSixty-nine candidates were brought to [[the Pentagon]] in Washington, DC, in two groups.<ref name=\"time19590420\" /> The first group of 35 assembled there on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], while the Air Force officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the space program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed the candidates on Project Mercury. The officials conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe candidates were given three briefings by NASA officials. The first was about NASA and Project Mercury; the second concerned the role of the pilot in the project; and the third was about the proposed astronaut training syllabus. In the afternoon candidates had short individual meetings with the NASA selection committee. It was emphasized that participation was entirely voluntary, that candidates were free to decline, and that there would be no career repercussions if they did so. Several candidates declined at this point.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe rest reported to NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, the following day for further screening. Voas gave them a series of [[standardized test]]s: the [[Miller Analogies Test]] to measure [[IQ]]; the Minnesota Engineering Analogies Test to measure engineering aptitude; and the Doppelt Mathematical Reasoning Test to measure mathematical aptitude. Donlan, North and Gamble conducted interviews in which they asked technical questions, and queried candidates about their motivations for applying to the program. Candidates were evaluated by two USAF psychiatrists, George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy. A USAF [[flight surgeon]], William S. Augerson, went over the candidates' medical records. Some were found to be over the height limit, and were eliminated at this juncture.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates: 15 from the Navy, 15 from the Air Force and two from the Marine Corps.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=57\u201358}} Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}}{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThen came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]] from January to March, under the direction of Albert H.

Weight was not a firm criterion like height, as losing weight was always possible, but the Mercury spacecraft set a limit of {{convert|180|lb}}. Cooper was the lightest, at {{convert|150|lbs}}, while Glenn was at the maximum weight of {{convert|180|lb}}, and Schirra was slightly overweight at {{convert|185|lb}}, and had to lose weight to be accepted.

Cooper and Slayton were Air Force officers with engineering backgrounds, so they dealt with the [[Redstone Arsenal]] and [[Convair]], who built the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone]] and [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] boosters used by Project Mercury.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=235\u2013237}} The astronauts affected the design of the Mercury spacecraft in significant ways, insisting that a window be installed, and pressing for a greater degree of astronaut autonomy in flying the spacecraft.{{sfn|Cunningham|2009|pp=442\u2013443}}\n\nThe astronauts remained on active duty as military officers, and were paid according to their [[Uniformed services pay grades of the United States|rank]]. To supplement their travel, they were provided a $9 ''[[per diem]]'' ({{Inflation|US|9|1959|fmt=eq}}) for day trips, and a $12 ''per diem'' ({{Inflation|US|12|1959|fmt=eq}}) for overnight trips, which did not cover the cost of hotels and restaurant meals. As a result, astronauts avoided spending money while traveling, as they were personally responsible for costs over their allotted ''per diem''.  An important component of their income was monthly flight pay, which ranged from $190 to $245 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|190|1959|fmt=c}} to ${{Inflation|US|245|1959|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Military Hazardous Duty Pay Charts 1955\u20131967 |publisher=Navy Cyberspace |url=https://www.navycs.com/charts/hazard-pay-chart-1955-1967.html |accessdate=April 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe astronauts traveled to frequent meetings around the country on commercial flights, which forced them to earn their flight pay on weekends. Grissom and Slayton regularly drove to [[Langley Air Force Base]], and attempted to fly the required four hours a month, but had to compete for [[Lockheed T-33|T-33]] aircraft with colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to [[McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base]] in [[Tennessee]], where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with [[William Hines]], a reporter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with [[Congressman]] [[James G. Fulton]]. The matter was taken up by the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]].{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=152\u2013153}}{{sfn|Cooper|Henderson|2000|pp=24\u201325}} Within weeks the astronauts were given priority access to USAF T-33s, F-102s and F-106s at Langley. In 1962, NASA acquired a fleet of [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38s]] for their use.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|pp=42\u201343}}\n\n[[File:LC-14 Mercury 7 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at Launch Complex 14 |alt=Circular plaque with the faces of the seven astronauts]]\nAfter [[General Motors]] executive [[Ed Cole]] presented Shepard with a brand-new [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Jim Rathmann]], a race car driver who won the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1960 and who was a Chevrolet dealer in [[Melbourne, Florida]], convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts were able to lease new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the military and local police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand.{{sfn|Burgess|2016|p=36}}\n\nThe Mercury astronauts established the style and appearance of astronauts. \"I soon learned\", [[Gene Kranz]] later recalled, \"if you saw someone wearing a short-sleeved [[Ban-Lon]] shirt and [[aviator sunglasses]], you were looking at an astronaut.\"{{sfn|Kranz|2000|p=14}} While busy with the intense training for their flights,{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=22}} they also drank and partied.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=35}} Some had affairs with the female [[groupie]]s that flocked around them.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=336}} NASA actively sought to protect the astronauts and the agency from negative publicity and maintain an image of \"clean-cut, all-American boy[s].\"{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=20}} The seven Mercury astronauts agreed to share equally any proceeds from interviews regardless of who flew first.<ref name=\"time19590420\" /><ref name=\"time19590824\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864827,00.html |title=The Big Story |magazine=Time |date=August 24, 1959 |access-date=February 15, 2019 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> In August 1959, they and their wives signed a contract with [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine for $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500000|1959|fmt=eq|r=-5}}) in exchange for exclusive access to their private lives, homes, and families.{{sfn|Logsdon|Launius|2008|p=16}}<ref name=\"time19590824\" /> Their official spokesman from 1959 to 1963 was NASA's public affairs officer, USAF Lieutenant Colonel [[John A.

The Astronaut Office, which was headed by Shepard, was one of three divisions in the Directorate of Flight Crew Operations, which was headed by Slayton. Since twenty-six of the first thirty astronauts were military personnel, the Astronaut Office had a military character, although few of the astronauts wore their uniforms even as much as once a year.{{sfn|Cunningham|2009|pp=40\u201343}} There was a bi-weekly military-style pilots' meeting at which activities planned for the upcoming two weeks would be discussed.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=168\u2013169}} A \"[[captain's mast]]\" was held afterwards to adjudicate disputes.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nShepard ran the Astronaut Office on a \"rank has its privileges\" basis.{{sfn|Cunningham|2009|pp=40\u201343}} The Mercury and 1962 astronauts had their own allocated parking spaces outside Building 4 at [[Johnson Space Center]], while astronauts from later groups had to compete for the remaining spaces allotted to astronauts.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|pp=113\u2013114}} While Shepard prohibited junior astronauts from receiving gifts and consulting or teaching part-time, he remained vice president and part owner of the Baytown National Bank in Houston, and devoted much of his time to it.{{sfn|O'Leary|1971|p=83}}\n\nTraining was always ungraded; the Mercury astronauts had nothing to gain and much to lose from being objectively compared to the newer classes, as it could threaten their privileged status, managerial control, and priority for flight assignments.

These include a series of biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially the [[History of Europe]]. Often simply referred to as \"The Plague\", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 475 million to between 350 and 375 million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of many of the survivors, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. [[R. H. Hilton]] has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.<ref>Barbara A.

There is a fair amount of geographic variation.

Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].<ref>According to Kelly (2005), \"[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside\". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John.

Between 60 and 70 percent of [[Hamburg]]'s and [[Bremen]]'s populations died. In [[Provence]], [[Dauphin\u00e9]], and [[Normandy]], historians observe a decrease of 60 percent of fiscal hearths. In some regions, two-thirds of the population was annihilated.

About half of [[Perpignan]]'s population died over the course of several months (only two of the eight physicians survived the plague).

Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).\n\nAll social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]] (daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]]) were the only European monarch to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months.

Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. [[Syria]] lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.\n\n==Social, environmental, and economic effects==\n\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennett-329>{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M.

At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.\n\nEurope had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo}}</ref> Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that \"the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.\" This leveling effect was reversed by a \"demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292\u201393, 304}}</ref> In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348\u201349.<ref name=guardian811/> However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.\n\n===Effect on the peasantry===\n\nThe great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}</ref> As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.<ref name=\"reference\" /><ref>Barbara A.

Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.\n\nFurthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.<ref name=econ/> Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm|title=Statute of Labourers Act|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].\n\nThe rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died,leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Effect on urban workers===\n\nIn the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers.

Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom. Cohn says the laws reflect the anxiety that followed the Black Death's new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, and from elite anxiety about manifestations such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans (in Sicily), and beggars.<ref>Samuel Cohn, \"After the Black Death: Labour Legislation and Attitudes Towards Labour in Late-Medieval Western Europe,\" ''Economic History Review'' (2007) 60#3 pp. 457\u201385 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502106 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Labour-saving innovation===\nBy 1200, virtually all of the Mediterranean basin and most of northern Germany had been deforested and cultivated.

The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned.

This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThere was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\n===Persecutions===\n{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}\n\nRenewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\",<ref name=nirenberg>David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.</ref> lepers<ref name=nirenberg/><ref>R.I.

As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.<ref>Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History of the Jewish People'' 2005. p. 154 \"However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'.

Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 p. 763 \"Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge.

Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.<ref name=byrne>Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.</ref> Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when \"the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food.\"<ref name=byrne/>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000\u20131500'' (2009) p. 182</ref> The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.<ref>Katherine L.

The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.\n\nReformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.<ref>Epstein, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Cultural effect==\n{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}\n[[File:Trionfo della morte, gi\u00e0 a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]\n\nThe Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the \"dance of death\" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.</ref> [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' \"Meravilhar no\u00b7s devo pas las gens\" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:\n\n{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth.

As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on \"anatomical investigations\" following the Black Death.<ref name=herlihy>David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.</ref> How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health.

The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.</ref> A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature.

These include a series of biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially the [[History of Europe]]. Often simply referred to as \"The Plague\", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 475 million to between 350 and 375 million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of many of the survivors, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. [[R. H. Hilton]] has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.<ref>Barbara A.

Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].<ref>According to Kelly (2005), \"[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside\". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John.

Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).\n\nAll social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]] (daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]]) were the only European monarch to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months.

Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. [[Syria]] lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.\n\n==Social, environmental, and economic effects==\n\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennett-329>{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M.

At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.\n\nEurope had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo}}</ref> Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that \"the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.\" This leveling effect was reversed by a \"demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292\u201393, 304}}</ref> In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348\u201349.<ref name=guardian811/> However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.\n\n===Effect on the peasantry===\n\nThe great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}</ref> As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.<ref name=\"reference\" /><ref>Barbara A.

Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.\n\nFurthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.<ref name=econ/> Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm|title=Statute of Labourers Act|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].\n\nThe rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died,leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Effect on urban workers===\n\nIn the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers.

Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom.

Much of the primeval vegetation returned, and abandoned fields and pastures were reforested.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThe Black Death encouraged innovation of labour-saving technologies, leading to higher productivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plagued by dear labour|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history-1|work=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2014|location=London|date=21 October 2013}}</ref> There was a shift from grain farming to animal husbandry. Grain farming was very labor-intensive, but animal husbandry needed only a shepherd and a few dogs and pastureland.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nPlague brought an eventual end of Serfdom in Western Europe. The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned. In England, more than 1300 villages were deserted between 1350 and 1500.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\">{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Robert S.|title=The black death: natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe|year=1983|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-912630-4 |edition=1. Free Press paperback|chapter=7}}</ref> Wages of labourers were high, but the rise in nominal wages following the Black Death was swamped by post-Plague inflation, so that real wages fell.<ref name=econ/>\n\nLabor was in such a short supply that Lords were forced to give better terms of tenure. This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThere was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\n===Persecutions===\n{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}\n\nRenewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\",<ref name=nirenberg>David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.</ref> lepers<ref name=nirenberg/><ref>R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}</ref> and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis.\n\nDifferences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.<ref>Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History of the Jewish People'' 2005. p. 154 \"However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'. Consequently, when the rat and the flea brought the Black Death, Jews, with better hygiene, suffered less severely ...\"</ref><ref>Joseph P Byrne, ''Encyclopedia of the Black Death'' Volume 1 2012. p. 15 \"Anti\u2013Semitism and Anti\u2013Jewish Violence before the Black Death ... Their attention to personal hygiene and diet, their forms of worship, and cycles of holidays were off-puttingly different.\"</ref> Accusations spread that Jews had caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]].<ref>Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe After the Black Death'' 2000 p. 146 \"There were several reasons for this, including, it has been suggested, the observance of laws of hygiene tied to ritual practices and a lower incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease\"</ref><ref>Richard S. Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 p. 763 \"Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt.\"</ref> European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.\n\nAccording to Joseph P. Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.<ref name=byrne>Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.</ref> Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when \"the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food.\"<ref name=byrne/>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000\u20131500'' (2009) p. 182</ref> The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.<ref>Katherine L. French, ''The Good Women of the Parish: Gender and Religion After the Black Death'' (U of Pennsylvania Press, 2011)</ref>\n\n[[File:Flagellants.png|thumb|Woodcut of flagellants ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493)]]\n[[Flagellants]] practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.\n\nReformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.<ref>Epstein, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Cultural effect==\n{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}\n[[File:Trionfo della morte, gi\u00e0 a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]\n\nThe Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the \"dance of death\" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.</ref> [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' \"Meravilhar no\u00b7s devo pas las gens\" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:\n\n{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, [[Agnolo di Tura]] ... buried my five children with my own hands ... And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/w%20civ%2002/plaguereadings.html |title=Plague readings |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref>}}\n\nBoccaccio wrote:\n\n{{quote|How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold and covered with a little earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spignesi |first1=Stephen |title=Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time |date=2002 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp |location=New York |page=1}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|right| ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493).]]\n\n===Medicine===\n\nAlthough the Black Death highlighted the shortcomings of medical science in the medieval era, it also led to positive changes in the field of medicine. As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on \"anatomical investigations\" following the Black Death.<ref name=herlihy>David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.</ref> How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health. Further, at this time, the importance of surgeons became more evident.<ref name=herlihy/>\n\nA theory put forth by Stephen O'Brien says the Black Death is likely responsible, through [[natural selection]], for the high frequency of the [[CCR5|CCR5-\u039432]] genetic defect in people of European descent. The gene affects [[T cell]] function and provides protection against [[HIV]], [[smallpox]], and possibly plague,<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Jefferys | first1= Richard | author2= Anne-christine d'Adesky | title = Designer Genes | journal = [[LPI Media#HIV Plus|HIV Plus]] | date=March 1999 | url = http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |issn=1522-3086 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110211/http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 | issue=3}}</ref> though for the last, no explanation as to how it would do that exists.

The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.</ref> A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u2013by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n[[Depopulation#Economic Consequences]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{ibid|date=March 2018}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{col-begin|2}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Aberth, John, ed.
