He was a member of Poland's golden generation of football players who rose to fame in the 1970s and early 80s. Over a decade, he represented Poland at five major tournaments starting with Gold at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich in 1972 and ending with a third-place finish at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. He reached the peak of his career at the [[Football World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]], where he was the [[World Cup Golden Boot|leading scorer]] and the only Pole to-date to have won the honor. After retiring from his playing career he had a brief stint as manager in several clubs in and out of Poland. \n\nLato, as a member of [[Democratic Left Alliance]], was a Polish Senator for the Rzeszow region, between 2001 and 2005. \n\nOn 30 October 2008, he was elected president of [[Polish Football Association]] (PZPN). As president of the PZPN he oversaw the Euro 2012 tournament, which was co-hosted by Poland. He was finally succeeded by [[Zbigniew Boniek]] on 26 October 2012.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Stal Mielec===\nLato was born in [[Malbork]]. He arrived at [[Stal Mielec]] as a teenager in 1966. Over the next 14 years, he led Stal from the Second Division to the top tier of Polish football and its most successful era in its history. During his time there, the club would go on to win the [[Ekstraklasa]]--the Polish First-Division--twice, in 1973 and 1976, as well as be regular participants in European competitions. This era of success culminated with their appearance at the quarter-finals of the [[1975-76 UEFA Cup]]. He inspired the club's good form with his prolific goal scoring, amassing 111 goals in 272 appearances. He was the top scorer of the Ekstraklasa during the 1972-73 and 1974-75 seasons.\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1980, having turned 30, Lato was finally free to leave Poland to pursue his career abroad. Despite his age, his international performances had garnered him interest. Lato ended up receiving a personal invitation from [[Pel\u00e9]] to play for the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]]. However, he ultimately decided on settling in Belgium playing for [[K.S.C. Lokeren]], scoring 12 goals over 2 seasons. By 1982, Lato decided to move on, signing for [[Atlante F.C.]] in [[Mexico]] where he amassed 15 goals. He spent the rest of the 1980s playing amateur football in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] for Polonia Hamilton--a club founded by Polish immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://poloniahamilton.ca/calendar/|title=HISTORY|date=3 February 2015|website=HAMILTON POLONIA F.C.|language=en-US|access-date=16 February 2019}}</ref> In 1991 he decided to retire from football. \n\n==International career==\nLato represented the [[Poland national football team|Polish national team]] for 13 years during the 1970s and 80s earning a total of 100 caps. He won his first cap under legendary Poland coach [[Kazimierz G\u00f3rski]] in a qualifying game for the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championships]] against West-Germany. The game ended as 1\u20133 loss. He was able to translate his prolific domestic goal-scoring record onto the international stage, where he became renowned for his striking prowess, especially in big games.\n\n===World Cup===\n\n====1974 World Cup====\nThe highpoint of Lato's professional career came during the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] in West Germany. Poland had a tough first round, having been seeded in Group 4, along with Argentina and Italy as well as Haiti. Lato went on to have immediate impact. In Poland's first game against Argentina, he scored 2 goals leading Poland to a historic 3\u20132 win. Buoyed, Poland hammered Haiti in the next game 7\u20130, with Lato adding another 2 goals. Finally Poland beat Italy 2\u20131, to end the group-stage as undefeated winners of Group 4.\n\nIn the second round, Poland were seeded into Group B with West Germany, Sweden and Yugoslavia. Lato continued his great form as the tournament progressed. Poland defeated Sweden 1\u20130 and Yugoslavia 2\u20131, with Lato contributing the winning goals in both games. Poland's final game of the group of was against West Germany. The Germans had also defeated Sweden and Yugoslavia, tying both teams on points. Thus, the game would prove decisive in deciding who would finish Group B 1st or 2nd--the winner would go to the final, the loser would go to the third-place play-off. Poland played a strong game, often threatening the West-German goal. However, Lato was unable to score and Poland succumbed to a 1\u20130 defeat--their only loss of the tournament.\n\nPoland's final game of the tournament was the third-place playoff against holders Brazil. In a tight game, Lato again proved to be the difference, scoring the only goal and leading the Polish national team to a Bronze finish. He ended the tournament as [[FIFA World Cup awards|top goalscorer]], having scored 7 goals.\n\n====1978 World Cup====\nLato had arguably had been Poland's best player at the 1974 World Cup. However, by the time of the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 tournament]] in Argentina he was unable to replicate his great form. In the first round, Poland were seeded in Group 2 with West Germany, Mexico and Tunisia. Poland did well, winning the group by drawing 0\u20130 with West Germany, and winning against Tunisia and Mexico, 1\u20130 and 3\u20131 respectively. Lato, however, was only able to score one goal, albeit a decisive one against Tunisia.\n\nIn the second round, Poland found themselves in the \"group of death\" against Argentina and Brazil--both tournament favorites--and Peru. Lato, unfortunately, couldn't resurrect his from four years prior, only mustering a single goal against Brazil. Poland ultimately finished third place having been beaten by both the hosts Argentina and Brazil 0\u20132 and 1\u20133 respectively. Poland managed to beat Peru 1\u20130 but that wasn't enough to secure 2nd place in Group B and they were duly eliminated. Having played in all of Poland's 6 games, Lato ended the tournament with only 2 goals.\n\n====1982 World Cup====\nLato was 32 by the time Poland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. His age was getting the better of him and he lacked the electrifying pace that defined his earlier career. Lato was still a first team player, but during Poland's 8 games at the tournament he managed only a solitary goal in Poland's 5\u20131 thrashing of Peru in the first round. However, several players had risen in a new generation of great Polish players, chief among them [[Zbigniew Boniek]]--who scored a hat-trick against Belgium--were able to fill the void. Despite his lack of goals Lato still contributed to the team play and played and important role. In the end, Poland reached the third-place playoff against France. They went on to win 3\u20132 and Lato added another Bronze World Cup medal to his collection.\n\n===Olympic Games===\nLato won medals at two Summer Olympics football competitions: a [[gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Summer Olympics]] and a [[silver medal]] at the [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics]].\n\nHis final game before retirement was on 17 April 1984, a friendly against Belgium. He was subbed off in the 85th and Poland lost the game 0\u20131. Lato amassed 45 goals and the third highest goal scoring total in Polish national team history, second only to that of [[Robert Lewandowski]] and [[W\u0142odzimierz Luba\u0144ski]]. He also had an impressive goal scoring record of 0.43 goals per game.[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060412/1/6ixx.html] He was the first Polish player to reach a century of caps.\n\n==Managerial career==\n[[File:Grzegorz Lato by Slawek.jpg|thumb|left|Grzegorz Lato (2010)]]\nIn 1996 he graduated from the School of Coaches of the [[PZPN|Polish Football Association]]. After finishing his football career, he became a coach. Initially, he coached in Canada where he became manager of North York Rockets(1988\u20131990). He then returned to his old club [[Stal Mielec]] (1991\u20131993 and 1996\u20131997) before coaching several other Polish clubs: [[Olimpia Pozna\u0144]] (1993\u20131995) and [[Amica Wronki]] (1995\u20131996). He had a brief stint in Greece as manager of [[Kavala F.C.|AO Kavala]] (1997) before he finally returned to Poland and eventually retired from managing with [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1999).[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0706-0040, Fu\u00dfball-WM, VR Polen - Brasilien 1-0.jpg|thumb|240px|Lato (left) and Brazil's [[Marinho Chagas]] in [[Munich]] during the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]]]]\n\n==After football==\nLato, as a member of [[Democratic Left Alliance]], was a Polish Senator for the Rzeszow region, between 2001 and 2005. \n\nIn October 2008, he was elected President of the [[Polish Football Association|Polish FA]] (PZPN).\nIn an 2011 interview, Lato said that if Poland didn't progress to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals he would hand in his resignation from the position of President of the [[Polish Football Association|Polish FA]]. After Poland's 0\u20131 defeat by the Czech Republic on 16 June 2012--which officially knocked them out of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] in the group stages--he refused to resign. He did not seek reelection and was replaced by Zbigniew Boniek, on October 2012.\n\n==Playing style==\nBlessed with remarkable acceleration, the talented right-winger consistently lived up to the high expectations placed upon him at the international level. Lato was not renowned as a crowd pleaser, but rather as a consistent team player.

He was a member of Poland's golden generation of football players who rose to fame in the 1970s and early 80s. Over a decade, he represented Poland at 5 major tournaments starting with Gold at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich in 1972 and ending with a third-place finish at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. He reached the peak of his career at the [[Football World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]], where he was the [[World Cup Golden Boot|leading scorer]] and the only Pole to-date to have won the honor. After retiring from his playing career he had a brief stint as manager in several clubs in and out of Poland. \n\nLato, as a member of [[Democratic Left Alliance]], was a Polish Senator for the Rzeszow region, between 2001 and 2005. \n\nOn 30 October 2008, he was elected president of [[Polish Football Association]] (PZPN). As president of the PZPN he oversaw the Euro 2012 tournament, which was co-hosted by Poland. He was finally succeeded by [[Zbigniew Boniek]] on 26 October 2012.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Stal Mielec===\nLato was born in [[Malbork]]. He arrived at [[Stal Mielec]] as a teenager in 1966. Over the next 14 years, he led Stal from the Second Division to the top tier of Polish football and its most successful era in its history. During his time there, the club would go on to win the [[Ekstraklasa]]--the Polish First-Division--twice, in 1973 and 1976, as well as be regular participants in European competitions. This era of success culminated with their appearance at the quarter-finals of the [[1975-76 UEFA Cup]]. He inspired the club's good form with his prolific goal scoring, amassing 111 goals in 272 appearances. He was the top scorer of the Ekstraklasa during the 1972-73 and 1974-75 seasons.\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1980, having turned 30, Lato was finally free to leave Poland to pursue his career abroad. Despite his age, his international performances had garnered him interest. Lato ended up receiving a personal invitation from [[Pel\u00e9]] to play for the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]]. However, he ultimately decided on settling in Belgium playing for [[K.S.C. Lokeren]], scoring 12 goals over 2 seasons. By 1982, Lato decided to move on, signing for [[Atlante F.C.]] in [[Mexico]] where he amassed 15 goals. He spent the rest of the 1980s playing amateur football in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] for Polonia Hamilton--a club founded by Polish immigrants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://poloniahamilton.ca/calendar/|title=HISTORY|date=3 February 2015|website=HAMILTON POLONIA F.C.|language=en-US|access-date=16 February 2019}}</ref> In 1991 he decided to retire from football. \n\n==International career==\nLato represented the [[Poland national football team|Polish national team]] for 13 years during the 1970s and 80s earning a total of 100 caps. He won his first cap under legendary Poland coach [[Kazimierz G\u00f3rski]] in a qualifying game for the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championships]] against West-Germany. The game ended as 1\u20133 loss. He was able to translate his prolific domestic goal-scoring record onto the international stage, where he became renowned for his striking prowess, especially in big games.\n\n===World Cup===\n\n====1974 World Cup====\nThe highpoint of Lato's professional career came during the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] in West Germany. Poland had a tough first round, having been seeded in Group 4, along with Argentina and Italy as well as Haiti. Lato went on to have immediate impact. In Poland's first game against Argentina, he scored 2 goals leading Poland to a historic 3\u20132 win. Buoyed, Poland hammered Haiti in the next game 7\u20130, with Lato adding another 2 goals. Finally Poland beat Italy 2\u20131, to end the group-stage as undefeated winners of Group 4.\n\nIn the second round, Poland were seeded into Group B with West Germany, Sweden and Yugoslavia. Lato continued his great form as the tournament progressed. Poland defeated Sweden 1\u20130 and Yugoslavia 2\u20131, with Lato contributing the winning goals in both games. Poland's final game of the group of was against West Germany. The Germans had also defeated Sweden and Yugoslavia, tying both teams on points. Thus, the game would prove decisive in deciding who would finish Group B 1st or 2nd--the winner would go to the final, the loser would go to the third-place play-off. Poland played a strong game, often threatening the West-German goal. However, Lato was unable to score and Poland succumbed to a 1\u20130 defeat--their only loss of the tournament.\n\nPoland's final game of the tournament was the third-place playoff against holders Brazil. In a tight game, Lato again proved to be the difference, scoring the only goal and leading the Polish national team to a Bronze finish. He ended the tournament as [[FIFA World Cup awards|top goalscorer]], having scored 7 goals.\n\n====1978 World Cup====\nLato had arguably had been Poland's best player at the 1974 World Cup. However, by the time of the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 tournament]] in Argentina he was unable to replicate his great form. In the first round, Poland were seeded in Group 2 with West Germany, Mexico and Tunisia. Poland did well, winning the group by drawing 0\u20130 with West Germany, and winning against Tunisia and Mexico, 1\u20130 and 3\u20131 respectively. Lato, however, was only able to score one goal, albeit a decisive one against Tunisia.\n\nIn the second round, Poland found themselves in the \"group of death\" against Argentina and Brazil--both tournament favorites--and Peru. Lato, unfortunately, couldn't resurrect his from four years prior, only mustering a single goal against Brazil. Poland ultimately finished third place having been beaten by both the hosts Argentina and Brazil 0\u20132 and 1\u20133 respectively. Poland managed to beat Peru 1\u20130 but that wasn't enough to secure 2nd place in Group B and they were duly eliminated. Having played in all of Poland's 6 games, Lato ended the tournament with only 2 goals.\n\n====1982 World Cup====\nLato was 32 by the time Poland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. His age was getting the better of him and he lacked the electrifying pace that defined his earlier career. Lato was still a first team player, but during Poland's 8 games at the tournament he managed only a solitary goal in Poland's 5\u20131 thrashing of Peru in the first round. However, several players had risen in a new generation of great Polish players, chief among them [[Zbigniew Boniek]]--who scored a hat-trick against Belgium--were able to fill the void. Despite his lack of goals Lato still contributed to the team play and played and important role. In the end, Poland reached the third-place playoff against France. They went on to win 3\u20132 and Lato added another Bronze World Cup medal to his collection.\n\n===Olympic Games===\nLato won medals at two Summer Olympics football competitions: a [[gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Summer Olympics]] and a [[silver medal]] at the [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics]].\n\nHis final game before retirement was on 17 April 1984, a friendly against Belgium. He was subbed off in the 85th and Poland lost the game 0\u20131. Lato amassed 45 goals and the third highest goal scoring total in Polish national team history, second only to that of [[Robert Lewandowski]] and [[W\u0142odzimierz Luba\u0144ski]]. He also had an impressive goal scoring record of 0.43 goals per game.[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060412/1/6ixx.html] He was the first Polish player to reach a century of caps.\n\n==Managerial career==\n[[File:Grzegorz Lato by Slawek.jpg|thumb|left|Grzegorz Lato (2010)]]\nIn 1996 he graduated from the School of Coaches of the [[PZPN|Polish Football Association]]. After finishing his football career, he became a coach. Initially, he coached in Canada where he became manager of North York Rockets(1988\u20131990). He then returned to his old club [[Stal Mielec]] (1991\u20131993 and 1996\u20131997) before coaching several other Polish clubs: [[Olimpia Pozna\u0144]] (1993\u20131995) and [[Amica Wronki]] (1995\u20131996). He had a brief stint in Greece as manager of [[Kavala F.C.|AO Kavala]] (1997) before he finally returned to Poland and eventually retired from managing with [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1999).[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0706-0040, Fu\u00dfball-WM, VR Polen - Brasilien 1-0.jpg|thumb|240px|Lato (left) and Brazil's [[Marinho Chagas]] in [[Munich]] during the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]]]]\n\n==After football==\nLato, as a member of [[Democratic Left Alliance]], was a Polish Senator for the Rzeszow region, between 2001 and 2005. \n\nIn October 2008, he was elected President of the [[Polish Football Association|Polish FA]] (PZPN).\nIn an 2011 interview, Lato said that if Poland didn't progress to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals he would hand in his resignation from the position of President of the [[Polish Football Association|Polish FA]]. After Poland's 0\u20131 defeat by the Czech Republic on 16 June 2012--which officially knocked them out of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] in the group stages--he refused to resign. He did not seek reelection and was replaced by Zbigniew Boniek, on October 2012.\n\n==Playing style==\nBlessed with remarkable acceleration, the talented right-winger consistently lived up to the high expectations placed upon him at the international level. Lato was not renowned as a crowd pleaser, but rather as a consistent team player. His great awareness on the pitch, coupled with his flexibility--he often played as a forward--allowed him to achieve success at the international and club levels. \n\n==Career statistics==\n'Source:<ref>{{NFT|17448|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"12\"|[[Stal Mielec]]\n|1969\u20131970\n|[[Ekstraklasa]]\n|18||6\n|-\n|1970\u20131971\n|Ekstraklasa\n|||11\n|-\n|1971\u20131972\n|Ekstraklasa\n|||\n|-\n|1972\u20131973\n|Ekstraklasa\n|24||13\n|-\n|1973\u20131974\n|Ekstraklasa\n|||13\n|-\n|1974\u20131975\n|Ekstraklasa\n|||19\n|-\n|1975\u20131976\n|Ekstraklasa\n|30||14\n|-\n|1976\u20131977\n|Ekstraklasa\n||||\n|-\n|1977\u20131978\n|Ekstraklasa\n||||\n|-\n|1978\u20131979\n|Ekstraklasa\n||||\n|-\n|1979\u20131980\n|Ekstraklasa\n||||\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!295||117\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[K.S.C.

When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again.

Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision.

Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him.

Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle.

Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own.

Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard.

When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun.

Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody.

Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew.

Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield.

Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle.

Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own.

A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case.

Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Control'' revolves around a clandestine U.S. government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which is responsible for the investigation of \"paranatural\" phenomena which defy the known laws of reality. These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html top 10 best games]''' through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. ''Control'' was released on 27 August 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jeff |first1=Cork |title=Control Is Coming Out This August |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/21/control-is-coming-out-this-august |website=Game Informer |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with some gaming publications naming it one of the top 10 games of 2019. ''Control'' was followed by a downloadable expansion, ''The Foundation'', which was released on March 26, 2020.

As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

They range from standard humans carrying firearms to heavily mutated variations which possess a variety of superpowers. Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Control'' revolves around a clandestine U.S. government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which is responsible for the investigation of \"paranatural\" phenomena which defy the known laws of reality. These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

Some of Jesse's abilities allow her to seize control of enemies' minds temporarily, turning them into her allies, and allowing their abilities to be used for the player's benefit.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Control'' revolves around a clandestine U.S. government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which is responsible for the investigation of \"paranatural\" phenomena which defy the known laws of reality. These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.
