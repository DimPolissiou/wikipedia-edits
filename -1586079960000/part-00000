This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several [[conjugated double bond]]s, as seen in the structure of [[cinnamic acid]]. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.\n\nThe matrix solution is mixed with the analyte (e.g. [[protein]]-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process.

The TOF measurement procedure is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a [[reflectron]] (an \"ion mirror\")  that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution. Modern commercial [[reflectron]] TOF instruments reach a resolving power m/\u0394m of 50,000 FWHM (full-width half-maximum, \u0394m defined as the peak width at 50% of peak height) or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xian|first=Feng|last2=Hendrickson|first2=Christopher L.|last3=Marshall|first3=Alan G.|date=2012-01-17|title=High Resolution Mass Spectrometry|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=84|issue=2|pages=708\u2013719|doi=10.1021/ac203191t|pmid=22263633|issn=0003-2700}}</ref>\n\nMALDI has been coupled with [[Ion-mobility spectrometry\u2013mass spectrometry|IMS]]-TOF MS to identify phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruotolo |first1=B.

The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of [[sepsis]], and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.<ref>Hrab\u00e1k, Jaroslav (2015). \"Detection of Carbapenemases Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Meropenem Hydrolysis Assay\".

This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several [[conjugated double bond]]s, as seen in the structure of [[cinnamic acid]]. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.\n\nThe matrix solution is mixed with the analyte (e.g. [[protein]]-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both [[hydrophobic]] and water-soluble ([[hydrophilic]]) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This solution is spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with analyte molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the analyte are said to be co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn analysis of biological systems, Inorganic salts, which are also part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process.

MALDI-TOF instruments are often equipped with a [[reflectron]] (an \"ion mirror\")  that reflects ions using an electric field. This increases the ion flight path, thereby increasing time of flight between ions of different m/z and increasing resolution.

There is hope that a similar technique could be used as a quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.<ref>Sim, K.; Shaw, A. G.; Randell, P.; Cox, M. J.; McClure, Z. E.; Li, M.

Dis. 2014.</ref>\n\nAnother example of the diagnostic power of MALDI/TOF is in the area of [[cancer]]. [[Pancreatic cancer]] remains one of the most deadly and difficult to diagnose cancers.<ref>Grantzdorffer I, Carl-McGrath S, Ebert MP, Rocken C. Proteomics of pancreatic cancer.

MALDI/TOF serves as a method for determining the [[drug resistance]] of bacteria, especially to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|\u03b2-lactams]] (Penicillin family). The MALDI/TOF detects the presence of carbapenemases, which indicates drug resistance to standard antibiotics. It is predicted that this could serve as a method for identifying a bacterium as drug resistant in as little as three hours. This technique could help physicians decide whether to prescribe more aggressive antibiotics initially.<ref>Hrab\u00e1k, Jaroslav (2015). \"Detection of Carbapenemases Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Meropenem Hydrolysis Assay\".

He grew up in [[Conway, Arkansas]]. As a child, Hays suffered from [[dyslexia]] and later in life confessed that he is not an avid reader because of that experience. He served in the U.S. Army, fighting in the [[Vietnam War]] for two years as a member of a [[long-range reconnaissance patrol]] team; as a result, he is an able [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] and actively uses these skills while working as an Arkansas state police detective. \n\nIn 1980, he and his partner Roland West ([[Stephen Dorff]]) are assigned a missing persons case involving the disappearance of two children. During the investigation, he meets Amelia Reardon ([[Carmen Ejogo]]), a schoolteacher who had the missing children in her class. They eventually marry and have two children together: son Henry ([[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]]) and daughter Rebecca (Deborah Ayorinde), who later estranges herself from the family. In 1990, Amelia writes ''Life and Death and the Harvest Moon'', a successful book about the missing children case Hays was investigating when they met. She is deceased as of 2015.\n\nHays is a peaceful, calm man tending to play a role of a good cop, while West, who is also a Vietnam veteran, is more aggressive and quicker to resort to violence. They take the case so personally that they violate the law themselves, kidnapping and killing a suspect. They then part ways and do not see each other for some 10 years before meeting again in 1990 to restart the investigation. In his senior years, Hays suffers from partial memory loss, even though his doctor says that he is physically well and shows no signs of [[Alzheimer's]] or [[dementia]]. Nevertheless, Hays hallucinates, sometimes seeing ghosts from his past, and has to use a recorder to fix the events and discover new facts during the interviewing. T\n\nEarly in the season, Hays confesses that the case split his life in two parts\u2014before the case and after it; even though he had previously considered the Vietnam war to be the main event in his life. He thinks about the case all the time, long after the authorities exhausted all lines of investigation and had to [[Cold case|close it]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cumming |first1=Ed |title=True Detective review: Mahershala Ali is compelling, but he's let down by this bloated drama |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/true-detective-review-tv-series-three-episode-one-mahershala-ali-stephen-dorff-a8722946.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|accessdate=4 February 2019 |date=14 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Keveney |first1=Bill |title='True Detective' star Mahershala Ali: One troubled man, three eras in HBO's Season 3 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/01/09/mahershala-ali-hbo-true-detective-season-3/2518258002/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|accessdate=4 February 2019 |date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Character arc==\nHays' character arc takes place in the [[Ozarks]] over three separate time periods. In 1980, he and West investigate a macabre crime involving two missing children, Will and Julie Purcell. In 1990, Hays and West are subpoenaed after a major break in the case. In 2015, a retired Hays is asked by a [[true crime]] documentary producer to look back at the unsolved case.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jake|last=Kleinman|title='True Detective' Season 3 Explained: One Important Detail You Missed |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52443-true-detective-season-3-episode-1-spoilers-explained |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |publisher=Bustle Digital Group|location=New York City|accessdate=February 6, 2019 |date=January 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2018/12/12/starring-mahershala-ali-and-created-by-nic-pizzolatto-true-detective-returns-for-third-season-jan-13-exclusively-on-hbo-854211/20181212hbo01/ |title=Starring Mahershala Ali and Created by Nic Pizzolatto, \"True Detective\" Returns for Third Season Jan. 13, Exclusively on HBO |date=December 12, 2018 |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |publisher=Futon Media|location=New York City|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref> The filmmaker, Elisa Montgomery ([[Sarah Gadon]]), believes the children were kidnapped and murdered by a [[pedophile]] ring, similar to a [[True Detective (season 1)|case that was successfully investigated in 2012]] by [[Rust Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) and Marty Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]) in Louisiana.\n\nIn 1980, Hays and West find Will dead in a cave, and come to suspect a local man named Brett Woodard ([[Michael Greyeyes]]). When Woodard gets involved in an armed standoff with his suspicious neighbors, Hays tries to get him to surrender peacefully, but Woodard commits [[suicide by cop]] by pulling a gun on Hays, leaving Hays no choice but to use deadly force. Woodard is blamed for the children's supposed death, and the case is closed. Amelia writes an article criticizing the case's conclusions. Hays' superiors try to force him to write a statement repudiating her article, but he refuses and is demoted. He tries to break up with Amelia, but then decides to marry her. \n\nIn 1990, Amelia writes a successful book about the case, which puts a strain on her and Hays' marriage; he believes she is trying to capitalize on the Purcell family's pain, while she thinks he is trying to control her. Meanwhile, the case is reopened when the children's mother Lucy ([[Mamie Gummer]]) is murdered, and a woman claiming to be Julie calls the police, asking them to stop looking for her. Hays and West are assigned the case, making Hays a homicide detective again. \n\nThey suspect Harris James ([[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]]), a former police officer who made several calls to Lucy before she died; they believe James [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] and murdered Will, and killed Lucy when she discovered what he had done. Hays and West try to arrest Harris, but he attacks them, forcing West to shoot him dead. They bury the body and [[evidence tampering|tamper with evidence]] to make it look like Harris left town. West resents Hays for putting him in a position that led to him killing someone, ending their partnership and friendship. The next day, Edward Hoyt ([[Michael Rooker]]), owner of supermarket chain Hoyt Foods, blackmails Hays into dropping the case with pictures of Hays following Harris the night of his disappearance. Hays then resigns from the police force.\n\nIn 2015, Hays is a widower, Amelia having died a few years earlier, and suffering from worsening memory loss. After talking to Montgomery, Hays contacts West for the first time in 25 years to help him solve the case once and for all, before he loses his cognitive faculties completely. They interview a former housekeeper of the Hoyt family, who reveals that Edward Hoyt had a daughter, Isabel, who lost her husband and daughter in a car wreck in 1977, and was then involved in one herself. She lived in the basement, and only a black man with one eye, \"Mr. June\", was allowed to attend to her. \n\nThey track down Junius Watts ([[Steven Williams]]), Isabel's former caretaker, who explains what happened with the Purcell children. A grief-stricken Isabel Hoyt saw Julie at a Hoyt Foods company picnic, and convinced herself that the girl was her daughter. Watts paid Lucy Purcell to allow Julie to play with Isabel regularly in the woods, under the supervision of Watts and Will. However, Isabel stopped taking her [[lithium]] and tried to take Julie. Will tried to stop her and hit his head on a rock, killing him. Harris James paid Lucy to allow Isabel to keep Julie, and Isabel gave Julie lithium to keep her happy. When Julie was a teenager, Watts helped her escape, but she went missing. She contracted [[HIV]] while on the road, and then stayed at a convent until she died of [[AIDS]]. A woman at the convent shows Hays and West \"Mary July\"'s gravestone. \n\nLater, while reading a passage from Amelia's book, Hays realizes that the convent groundskeeper was a classmate of Julie's before she disappeared, suspecting that his daughter, Lucy, is Julie's child and that Julie is alive. Hays drives to their house, but when he arrives he cannot remember why he is there.

He served in the U.S. Army, fighting in the [[Vietnam War]] for two years as a member of a [[long-range reconnaissance patrol]] team; as a result, he is an able [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] and actively uses these skills while working as an Arkansas state police detective. \n\nIn 1980, he and his partner Roland West ([[Stephen Dorff]]) are assigned a missing persons case involving the disappearance of two children. During the investigation, he meets Amelia Reardon ([[Carmen Ejogo]]), a schoolteacher who had the missing children in her class. They eventually marry and have two children together: son Henry ([[Ray Fisher]]) and daughter Rebecca (Deborah Ayorinde), who later estranges herself from the family. In 1990, Amelia writes ''Life and Death and the Harvest Moon'', a successful book about the missing children case Hays was investigating when they met. She is deceased as of 2015.\n\nHays is a peaceful, calm man tending to play a role of a good cop, while West, who is also a Vietnam veteran, is more aggressive and quicker to resort to violence. They take the case so personally that they violate the law themselves, kidnapping and killing a suspect. They then part ways and do not see each other for some 10 years before meeting again in 1990 to restart the investigation. In his senior years, Hays suffers from partial memory loss, even though his doctor says that he is physically well and shows no signs of [[Alzheimer's]] or [[dementia]]. Nevertheless, Hays hallucinates, sometimes seeing ghosts from his past, and has to use a recorder to fix the events and discover new facts during the interviewing. T\n\nEarly in the season, Hays confesses that the case split his life in two parts\u2014before the case and after it; even though he had previously considered the Vietnam war to be the main event in his life. He thinks about the case all the time, long after the authorities exhausted all lines of investigation and had to [[Cold case|close it]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cumming |first1=Ed |title=True Detective review: Mahershala Ali is compelling, but he's let down by this bloated drama |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/true-detective-review-tv-series-three-episode-one-mahershala-ali-stephen-dorff-a8722946.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|accessdate=4 February 2019 |date=14 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Keveney |first1=Bill |title='True Detective' star Mahershala Ali: One troubled man, three eras in HBO's Season 3 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/01/09/mahershala-ali-hbo-true-detective-season-3/2518258002/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|accessdate=4 February 2019 |date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Character arc==\nHays' character arc takes place in the [[Ozarks]] over three separate time periods. In 1980, he and West investigate a macabre crime involving two missing children, Will and Julie Purcell. In 1990, Hays and West are subpoenaed after a major break in the case. In 2015, a retired Hays is asked by a [[true crime]] documentary producer to look back at the unsolved case.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jake|last=Kleinman|title='True Detective' Season 3 Explained: One Important Detail You Missed |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52443-true-detective-season-3-episode-1-spoilers-explained |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |publisher=Bustle Digital Group|location=New York City|accessdate=February 6, 2019 |date=January 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2018/12/12/starring-mahershala-ali-and-created-by-nic-pizzolatto-true-detective-returns-for-third-season-jan-13-exclusively-on-hbo-854211/20181212hbo01/ |title=Starring Mahershala Ali and Created by Nic Pizzolatto, \"True Detective\" Returns for Third Season Jan. 13, Exclusively on HBO |date=December 12, 2018 |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |publisher=Futon Media|location=New York City|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref> The filmmaker, Elisa Montgomery ([[Sarah Gadon]]), believes the children were kidnapped and murdered by a [[pedophile]] ring, similar to a [[True Detective (season 1)|case that was successfully investigated in 2012]] by [[Rust Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) and Marty Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]) in Louisiana.\n\nIn 1980, Hays and West find Will dead in a cave, and come to suspect a local man named Brett Woodard ([[Michael Greyeyes]]). When Woodard gets involved in an armed standoff with his suspicious neighbors, Hays tries to get him to surrender peacefully, but Woodard commits [[suicide by cop]] by pulling a gun on Hays, leaving Hays no choice but to use deadly force. Woodard is blamed for the children's supposed death, and the case is closed. Amelia writes an article criticizing the case's conclusions. Hays' superiors try to force him to write a statement repudiating her article, but he refuses and is demoted. He tries to break up with Amelia, but then decides to marry her. \n\nIn 1990, Amelia writes a successful book about the case, which puts a strain on her and Hays' marriage; he believes she is trying to capitalize on the Purcell family's pain, while she thinks he is trying to control her. Meanwhile, the case is reopened when the children's mother Lucy ([[Mamie Gummer]]) is murdered, and a woman claiming to be Julie calls the police, asking them to stop looking for her. Hays and West are assigned the case, making Hays a homicide detective again. \n\nThey suspect Harris James ([[Scott Shepherd]]), a former police officer who made several calls to Lucy before she died; they believe James [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] and murdered Will, and killed Lucy when she discovered what he had done. Hays and West try to arrest Harris, but he attacks them, forcing West to shoot him dead. They bury the body and [[evidence tampering|tamper with evidence]] to make it look like Harris left town. West resents Hays for putting him in a position that led to him killing someone, ending their partnership and friendship. The next day, Edward Hoyt ([[Michael Rooker]]), owner of supermarket chain Hoyt Foods, blackmails Hays into dropping the case with pictures of Hays following Harris the night of his disappearance. Hays then resigns from the police force.\n\nIn 2015, Hays is a widower, Amelia having died a few years earlier, and suffering from worsening memory loss. After talking to Montgomery, Hays contacts West for the first time in 25 years to help him solve the case once and for all, before he loses his cognitive faculties completely. They interview a former housekeeper of the Hoyt family, who reveals that Edward Hoyt had a daughter, Isabel, who lost her husband and daughter in a car wreck in 1977, and was then involved in one herself. She lived in the basement, and only a black man with one eye, \"Mr. June\", was allowed to attend to her. \n\nThey track down Junius Watts ([[Steven Williams]]), Isabel's former caretaker, who explains what happened with the Purcell children. A grief-stricken Isabel Hoyt saw Julie at a Hoyt Foods company picnic, and convinced herself that the girl was her daughter. Watts paid Lucy Purcell to allow Julie to play with Isabel regularly in the woods, under the supervision of Watts and Will. However, Isabel stopped taking her [[lithium]] and tried to take Julie. Will tried to stop her and hit his head on a rock, killing him. Harris James paid Lucy to allow Isabel to keep Julie, and Isabel gave Julie lithium to keep her happy. When Julie was a teenager, Watts helped her escape, but she went missing. She contracted [[HIV]] while on the road, and then stayed at a convent until she died of [[AIDS]]. A woman at the convent shows Hays and West \"Mary July\"'s gravestone. \n\nLater, while reading a passage from Amelia's book, Hays realizes that the convent groundskeeper was a classmate of Julie's before she disappeared, suspecting that his daughter, Lucy, is Julie's child and that Julie is alive. Hays drives to their house, but when he arrives he cannot remember why he is there. Julie (Bea Santos) takes pity on Hays and calls his son, who takes him home.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|True Detective (TV series)}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.hbo.com/true-detective}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2356777|True Detective}}\n* {{TV.com show|true-detective|True Detective}}\n\n{{True Detective}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hays, Wayne}}\n[[Category:Drama television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2019]]\n[[Category:Fictional police detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Police misconduct in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:True Detective]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Ray Fisher\u2192Ray Fisher (actor),Scott Shepherd\u2192Scott Shepherd (actor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Hays_(True_Detective)"}

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\", although in the 19th century, its western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].\n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters.

Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable.

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] participle in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe vocative of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three definite articles, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant.\n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and past tense of the verb conjugated for the person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, Voice, Mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a grammatical aspect (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117\"/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\", although in the 19th century, its western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].\n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian [[syntax]] is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible, share many common linguistic features and are socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|300px|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group.

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109\u2013110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels.

Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms.

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] participle in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe vocative of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three definite articles, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant.\n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and past tense of the verb conjugated for the person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, Voice, Mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a grammatical aspect (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117\"/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''
