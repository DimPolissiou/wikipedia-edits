In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women. Statistics show that the virus is most deadly among older generations and men.

He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge. Edhi travelled to [[Europe]] and made his way to [[London]] via [[Rome]] by asking for donations. His time in London allowed him to thoroughly examine the [[Welfare|social welfare]] programs active throughout the [[United Kingdom]], off of which he organized and laid the foundation for the rest of his charitable works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8440920/The-day-I-met-Abdul-Sattar-Edhi-a-living-saint.html|title=The day I met Abdul Sattar Edhi, a living saint|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-10|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"People have become educated, but have yet to become human.\"|author=|title=|source=Abdul Sattar Edhi<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/middleeast/abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-father-teresa-dies-at-88.html?nytmobile=0|title=Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's 'Father Teresa,' Dies at 88 - NYTimes.com|first=Salman|last=Masood|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n===Date of Birth Controversy===\nIn his autobiography, Edhi revealed that he didn't know his actual date of birth,{{sfn|Tehmina Durrani|1996}} but according to media reports published following his death, he was born on 1 January 1928.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/135894-Name-the-new-airport-after-Edhi|title=Name the new airport after Edhi|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi laid to rest in Karachi|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Radio Pakistan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135535/http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nation mourns Abdul Sattar Edhi's demise \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/344363-Nation-mourns-Abdul-Sattar-Edhis-demise|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US condoles death of Abdul Sattar Edhi|url=http://nation.com.pk/international/12-Jul-2016/us-condoles-death-of-abdul-sattar-edhi|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Significant people born on 1st January|url=http://aaj.tv/2016/01/significant-people-born-on-1st-january/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Aaj News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dailytimes {{!}} Late Abdul Sattar Edhi's Qul held amid tight security|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/11-Jul-16/late-abdul-sattar-edhis-qul-held-amid-tight-security|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The gems world lost in 2016 \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/368092-The-gems-world-lost-in-2016|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref> In 2017, [[Google Doodle]] marked his date of birth as 28 February 1928 following which several reports emerged in favour of 28 February 1928 being his birthdate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi: Why Google honours him today|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/abdul-sattar-edhi-google-honours-angel-mercy-170227140720826.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Who was Abdul Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's humble 'Angel of Mercy' who founded a charity empire from a Karachi slum?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/27/who-was-abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-angel-of-mercy/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' noted \"There has been uncertainty about when his birthday is.

He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre.

The team is organised by [[Cricket Canada]], which became an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate Member]] of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 1968.\n\nWith the [[United States national cricket team|United States]], Canada was one of the two participants in [[Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844|the first ever international cricket match]], played in [[New York City]] in 1844. The annual Canada\u2013U.S. fixture is now known as the [[K.A. Auty Cup|Auty Cup]]. Canada's first international match against a team other than the U.S. came in 1932, when [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] toured.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/60/Other_Matches.html Other matches played by Canada] \u2013 CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.</ref> As with the ICC associate members, the team's first major international tournament was the [[1979 ICC Trophy]] in England, where they qualified for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]] after placing second to [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. After that, Canada did not make another World Cup [[2003 Cricket World Cup|until 2003]], although they remained one of the leading associate teams. From 2006 to 2013, Canada had both [[One Day International]] (ODI) and [[Twenty20 International]] status, making appearances at the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]]s. However, since the introduction of the new [[World Cricket League]] divisional structure, the team has been less successful \u2013 they placed amongst the bottom teams at the [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|2014 World Cup Qualifier]] and the [[2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two|2015 WCL Division Two]] tournaments, and were consequently relegated to the [[2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Three|2017 Division Three]] event.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Canada and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\n\nIt is generally thought that cricket was introduced to Canada by British soldiers after the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759, although the earliest confirmed reference to cricket is of matches played on [[Saint Helen's Island]], Quebec in 1785 on what later became the site of [[Expo 67]].\n\nThe roots of modern Canadian cricket though come from the regions of Upper Canada, in particular Toronto, then known as York. During the early years of the nineteenth century, a schoolmaster by the name of [[George Anthony Barber]] encouraged the game there, and founded the [[Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club|Toronto Cricket Club]] in 1827. Barber instigated a game played between the Toronto Cricket Club and the cricket team of [[Upper Canada College]] in 1836, a game won by the college team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/99/99022.html |title=Toronto Cricket Club v Upper Canada College|publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref> This game has been played annually ever since. As already mentioned, Canada played its first international against the [[United States cricket team|USA]] in 1844 in New York at St George's Cricket Club, now the site of the [[New York University|New York University Medical Center]].\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]] led an English team to Canada in 1859, which was the first ever international cricket tour. A product of the tour was a book by [[Fred Lillywhite]] entitled ''The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States'', published the following year. On the tour, which also ventured into the US, the team won all five official matches against a 22 of Lower Canada (by 8 wickets at Montreal, Quebec on 26 October \u2013 27 September), a 22 of the United States (by an innings and 64 runs at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on 3\u20135 October), a different 22 of the United States (by 7 wickets at Philadelphia on 10\u201312 October), a 22 of Lower Canada (by 10 wickets at Hamilton, Ontario on 17\u201319 October) and a further 22 of the United States (by an innings and 68 runs at Rochester, New York on 21\u201325 October). There were also some exhibition matches and two excursions to view the [[Niagara Falls]].\n\nWhen Canada became a nation in 1867, cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by [[John A. Macdonald]], the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/Reebok%20and%20Cricket%20Canada%20Enter%20into%20Multi-Year%20Sponsorship%20Agreement.pdf | title=Reebok and Cricket Canada Enter into Multi-Year Sponsorship Agreement | accessdate=9 March 2011 | date=23 November 2010 | publisher=Cricket Canada | page=2 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725134036/http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/Reebok%20and%20Cricket%20Canada%20Enter%20into%20Multi-Year%20Sponsorship%20Agreement.pdf | archivedate=25 July 2011 | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/CAN/CCA_HISTORY_11SEP1997.html | title=A brief history of cricket Cricket in Canada | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Boller, Kevin | publisher=cricinfo}}</ref> The influence of baseball from the United States saw a decline in the popularity of cricket, despite tours from English and Australian teams.

The tour started with two matches against [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]], against whom Canada drew one game and lost the other, followed by two matches against [[Scottish cricket team|Scotland]] with the same result. The tour then ventured into the north east of England with a defeat against the Gentlemen of Northumberland and a draw against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]].\n\nThe tour then continued with various matches against county sides and others, with wins coming against the Gentlemen of Derbyshire and the Gentlemen of Warwickshire. The Canadian team finished the tour with a win/loss record of 2/5 with the remaining twelve games all drawn.\n\n===1950s===\nThe [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] visited Canada in 1951, the highlight of which was the first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] game played by the Canadian national team, played in [[Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club Ground|Armour Heights]], Toronto, which was won by the visiting side.<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1952, pp. 898\u2013902.</ref> This was followed in 1954 by a [[Canadian cricket tours of England#First-class matches in 1954|tour to England]] on which Canada played eighteen games, four of which were given first-class status, including one against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] who were also touring England at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1954_ENG_Canada_in_England_1954.html |title=Canada in England, 1954 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> The MCC again visited Canada in 1959 under [[Dennis Silk]], and played a 3-day game against a Canada XI in Toronto which they won by 10 wickets. They were undefeated throughout the tour, winning most of their matches by wide margins, but had a closely fought draw against the [[Toronto Cricket Club]].<ref>''Wisden'' 1960, pp. 870\u201371.</ref> This was the decade when the [[Imperial Cricket Conference]] had plans to grant Canada [[Test cricket|Test status]], but Canada themselves postponed the idea as they felt that the Canadian national team was not of sufficient standard, and that competing against full-members' sides needed some time as they wanted to improve their cricket even domestically. However, things did not go as planned and it would be fifty years before Canada next played a first-class match.\n\n===1960s===\nThe annual series of matches between Canada and the USA continued, alternating between the countries. In the 1963 match in Toronto, [[Ray Nascimento]] scored 176, then a record for the series.\n\n===1970s===\nCanada drew a game against Ireland in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/100/100626.html |title=Canada XI v Ireland, 1973 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=16 September 1973 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and the following year again embarked on a tour of England. The tour was a much lower profile than the 1954 tour, with the games being against club sides, county second XIs, and minor counties. Canada had a 4/6 win/loss record on the tour, with a further six games being drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1974_ENG_Canada_in_England_1974.html |title=Canada in England, 1974|publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> In 1979, Canada participated in the [[1979 ICC Trophy|first]] [[ICC Trophy]]. They reached the final of the competition, which qualified them for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]], where they played their first [[One Day International]]s. The World Cup was not a successful tournament for the Canadians though, and they failed to progress beyond the first round, losing all three games.\n\n===1980s===\nCanada participated in the ICC Trophy again in [[1982 ICC Trophy|1982]] and [[1986 ICC Trophy|1986]]. They could not repeat their success of 1979 though, and failed to progress beyond the first round on both occasions. Other internationals in the 1980s include a no result game against Ireland in 1981,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/100/100648.html |title=Canada in Ireland, 1981 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=7 June 1981 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and a 3 wicket loss to [[Barbadian cricket team|Barbados]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/49/49335.html |title=Canada in Barbados, 1987/88 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=5 November 1987 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe 1990s saw Canada progress up the international ladder, playing in three further ICC Trophy tournaments, their best being a seventh-place finish in [[1997 ICC Trophy|1997]]. They also began competing in West Indian domestic one-day cricket in 1996, and competed in the [[Commonwealth Games]] [[Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games|cricket tournament]] in [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]], though they did not progress beyond the first round.\n\n===2000s===\n2000 saw Canada host the first [[ICC Americas Championship]], a tournament which they won. The following year they embarked on a tour to Sri Lanka, but the highlight of 2001 was their hosting of the ICC Trophy. They finished third in the tournament, which qualified them for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. It was this ICC Trophy tournament that first saw the emergence of [[John Davison (Canadian cricketer)|John Davison]], who was to become one of Canada's most successful players.\n\nCanada played various matches in the buildup to the World Cup, visiting Argentina in April 2002, finishing as runners up to longtime rivals the US in the Americas Championship, swiftly followed by a fifth-place finish in the [[ICC 6 Nations Challenge]] in Namibia. The West Indian A team toured Canada later in the year, and Canada won the one-day series 2\u20131, and drew a two-day game. This was followed by Canada's best performance to date in West Indian domestic one-day cricket, winning two games in their first round group, just missing out on qualification for the semi finals.\n\nThe World Cup itself was a tournament of contrasting fortunes for the Canadians. They started with their first ODI win, over [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]]. Two games later saw them dismissed for 36 against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]], then the lowest score in One Day International history. The next game against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] saw John Davison score the fastest ever World Cup century, although Canada lost that game, and did not progress past the first round.\n{{Cricket match summary\n| date = 11 February 2003\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|CAN}}\n| score1 = 180 (49.1 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|BAN}}\n| score2 = 120 (28 overs)\n| result = Canada won by 60 runs\n| venue = [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead]], [[Durban]], South Africa\n| umpires = [[Aleem Dar]] (Pak) and [[Brian Jerling|BG Jerling]] (SA)\n| motm = [[Austin Codrington|A Codrington]] (Can)\n| runs1 = [[Ian Billcliff|IS Billcliff]] 42 (63)\n| runs2 = [[Sanwar Hossain|S Hossain]] 25 (24)\n| wickets1 = [[Sanwar Hossain|MS Hossain]] 2/26 (10)\n| wickets2 = [[Austin Codrington|A Codrington]] 5/27 (9)\n| scorecard = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65239.html Scorecard]\n| rain = \n}}\n\n===2004\u20132008===\n2006 started badly for Canada, with a last place finish in the Six Nations Challenge in the United Arab Emirates after Canada lost all their games. They had improved significantly by the time of the ICC Americas Championship in [[Bermuda]], which they won. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], finishing as runners up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since [[Jim Laker]]'s 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.\n\nIn 2005, Canada again finished third in the [[2005 ICC Trophy|ICC Trophy]], which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]], as well as qualifying them for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]]. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.\n\nIn 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], beating [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] by 25 runs and [[Bermudian cricket team|Bermuda]] by nine wickets, but their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]].\n\nIn August, Canada took part in the first Division of the Americas Championship. They beat [[Argentine cricket team|Argentina]] and longtime rivals the [[United States cricket team|USA]], but lost to the [[Cayman Islands cricket team|Cayman Islands]] and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.\n\n===2010\u20132014===\n{{Outdated section|date=September 2015}}\nIn June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland.\n\nIn August, Canada travelled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain.\n\nIn late summer of 2008, West Indies and Bermuda came to Canada to play in the Scotiabank One-Day Series against Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda, to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.\n\nDuring the Scotiabank Series the talents of Rizwan Cheema were discovered \u2013 he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost both and tied one match, however in the tie with Zimbabwe, Canada lost by points in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka were eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament was expected to be played annually for the following four years.\n\nIn late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out by rain.\n\nIn April 2009 Canada participated in the 2009 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament. Assembling the best Canadian team in many years, Canada rolled through the opening stages of the event and eventually finished second in the tournament. The impressive display earned Canada a berth in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe ICC announced that the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]] will only have 10 participating teams \u2013 this makes it difficult for the Associate Countries to qualify for the world cup. [[Cricket Canada]] expressed its unhappiness with the reduced world cup<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/canada/content/story/482134.html |title=Canada news: Canada unhappy with reduced World Cup &#124; Canada Cricket News &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo  |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada lost [[One Day International|ODI]] & [[T20I]] status and with no prospect of big-stage international cricket to come until next qualifier, owing to a poor performance at the World Cup Qualifier in New Zealand.\n\n===2015===\n\nThe big event for Canada to make a mark in the year 2015 was the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland. Unfortunately, Canada failed to win a single match and finished at the bottom of Group B.\n\nIn the first match, against Kenya in the picturesque Edinburgh, Canada put together 143 runs in 20 overs with the loss of 5 wickets. In response, Irfan Karim's 54-ball 74 led Kenya to a convincing seven-wicket win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/896727.html|title=Karim 74 guides Kenya to comfortable win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe second match for Canada was against the relative newcomers to the scene, Oman, and was played in Stirling, Scotland. This game was reduced to 13 overs a side, down from 20 due to inclement weather. Canada's batting, after Oman opted to bowl first, was largely put together courtesy of a 25-ball 52 from Nitish Kumar, who scored four fours and three sixes. In response, Zeeshan Maqsood's unbeaten 86, powered Oman to a seven-wicket win with 10 balls to spare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/897911.html|title=Maqsood assault gives Oman big win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada played their third match of the tournament at the same venue in Stirling, Scotland against United Arab Emirates. UAE got off to the ideal start. Aside from winning the coin-toss, they decided to bowl first. Canada, batting first, lost their first 2 wickets in the first 8 balls bowled. It was followed by a solid partnership between Hiral Shah and Nitish Kumar who plundered 58 runs between them. But the tide turned again in UAE's favor as they picked up a heap of wickets to reduce Canada down to 109 for the loss of 9 wickets. But Navneet Dhaliwal came to the rescue with an unbeaten 39 to raise the total to 132 runs at the end of 20 overs. In response, UAE lost their first wicket in the third over but good partnerships for the second (25 runs), third (40 runs) and fourth (19 runs) wickets kept them on track. The match seemed level when the target was whittled down to 33 runs required in three overs which came down to 25 runs required off 12 balls. But, Shakoor and Patil brought UAE home in the last over after plundering Cecil Parvez for 21 runs in his final over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/898625.html|title=Shahzad 56 sets up thrilling five-wicket win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada shifted back to Edinburgh for their fourth match of the tournament against hosts Scotland. Canada had lost the coin-toss again in this match and the home team inserted Canada into batting first. They got off to a quick start, racing to 24 in 2.3 overs before Alasdair Evans dismissed Ruvindu Gunasekara. The other bowlers too did not allow any meaningful partnerships to develop between any of the Canadian batsmen, reducing them to 87 for the loss of 8 wickets by the 16th over. A 48-run, ninth-wicket partnership between Navneet Dhaliwal (34*) and No. 10 Junaid Siddiqui, who scored 28 off 16, took them past the triple-figure mark to help them finish on 135 for 8. In response, Scotland started off brightly \u2013 at a stunning rate of 10 runs per over till the sixth over \u2013 even as Satsimranjit Dhindsa got rid of Calum MacLeod for a 15-ball 29. The wicket didn't cost Scotland much as they went about with the same momentum despite losing Matthew Cross to Dhindsa as well, and cruised to a comfortable win with 32 balls to spare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/899343.html|title=Coetzer fifty hands Scotland easy win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada played their fifth and final match of the tournament at the same venue in Edinburgh against Netherlands. They lost the toss again and were inserted to bat again. This time though, the batting showed resilience and the team put together a total of 172 for the loss of 8 wickets which came on the back of a half-century from Ruvindu Gunasekera (51) and late blitzes from team captain Rizwan Cheema and wicket-keeper batsman Hamza Tariq. In response, the Netherlands batsmen, particularly Steven Myburgh, Wesley Barresi and Michael Swart led an attacking display of powerful batting to record a solid win for their team with 15 balls to spare. Thus, ending a dismal 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier for the Canada national cricket team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/899779.html|title=Myburgh helps Netherlands ace 174 chase|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the dismal performance at the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 qualifier, some positive news followed for the Canada national cricket team players.

The team is organised by [[Cricket Canada]], which became an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate Member]] of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 1968.\n\nWith the [[United States national cricket team|United States]], Canada was one of the two participants in [[Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844|the first ever international cricket match]], played in [[New York City]] in 1844. The annual Canada\u2013U.S. fixture is now known as the [[K.A. Auty Cup|Auty Cup]]. Canada's first international match against a team other than the U.S. came in 1932, when [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] toured.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/60/Other_Matches.html Other matches played by Canada] \u2013 CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.</ref> As with the ICC associate members, the team's first major international tournament was the [[1979 ICC Trophy]] in England, where they qualified for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]] after placing second to [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. After that, Canada did not make another World Cup [[2003 Cricket World Cup|until 2003]], although they remained one of the leading associate teams. From 2006 to 2013, Canada had both [[One Day International]] (ODI) and [[Twenty20 International]] status, making appearances at the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]]s. However, since the introduction of the new [[World Cricket League]] divisional structure, the team has been less successful \u2013 they placed amongst the bottom teams at the [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|2014 World Cup Qualifier]] and the [[2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two|2015 WCL Division Two]] tournaments, and were consequently relegated to the [[2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Three|2017 Division Three]] event.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Canada and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\n\nIt is generally thought that cricket was introduced to Canada by British soldiers after the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759, although the earliest confirmed reference to cricket is of matches played on [[Saint Helen's Island]], Quebec in 1785 on what later became the site of [[Expo 67]].\n\nThe roots of modern Canadian cricket though come from the regions of Upper Canada, in particular Toronto, then known as York. During the early years of the nineteenth century, a schoolmaster by the name of [[George Anthony Barber]] encouraged the game there, and founded the [[Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club|Toronto Cricket Club]] in 1827. Barber instigated a game played between the Toronto Cricket Club and the cricket team of [[Upper Canada College]] in 1836, a game won by the college team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/99/99022.html |title=Toronto Cricket Club v Upper Canada College|publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref> This game has been played annually ever since. As already mentioned, Canada played its first international against the [[United States cricket team|USA]] in 1844 in New York at St George's Cricket Club, now the site of the [[New York University|New York University Medical Center]].\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]] led an English team to Canada in 1859, which was the first ever international cricket tour. A product of the tour was a book by [[Fred Lillywhite]] entitled ''The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States'', published the following year. On the tour, which also ventured into the US, the team won all five official matches against a 22 of Lower Canada (by 8 wickets at Montreal, Quebec on 26 October \u2013 27 September), a 22 of the United States (by an innings and 64 runs at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on 3\u20135 October), a different 22 of the United States (by 7 wickets at Philadelphia on 10\u201312 October), a 22 of Lower Canada (by 10 wickets at Hamilton, Ontario on 17\u201319 October) and a further 22 of the United States (by an innings and 68 runs at Rochester, New York on 21\u201325 October). There were also some exhibition matches and two excursions to view the [[Niagara Falls]].\n\nWhen Canada became a nation in 1867, cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by [[John A. Macdonald]], the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/Reebok%20and%20Cricket%20Canada%20Enter%20into%20Multi-Year%20Sponsorship%20Agreement.pdf | title=Reebok and Cricket Canada Enter into Multi-Year Sponsorship Agreement | accessdate=9 March 2011 | date=23 November 2010 | publisher=Cricket Canada | page=2 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725134036/http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/Reebok%20and%20Cricket%20Canada%20Enter%20into%20Multi-Year%20Sponsorship%20Agreement.pdf | archivedate=25 July 2011 | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/CAN/CCA_HISTORY_11SEP1997.html | title=A brief history of cricket Cricket in Canada | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Boller, Kevin | publisher=cricinfo}}</ref> The influence of baseball from the United States saw a decline in the popularity of cricket, despite tours from English and Australian teams. The third tour by an English team in 1872 featured none other than the famous [[W. G. Grace]].

The tour started with two matches against [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]], against whom Canada drew one game and lost the other, followed by two matches against [[Scottish cricket team|Scotland]] with the same result. The tour then ventured into the north east of England with a defeat against the Gentlemen of Northumberland and a draw against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]].\n\nThe tour then continued with various matches against county sides and others, with wins coming against the Gentlemen of Derbyshire and the Gentlemen of Warwickshire. The Canadian team finished the tour with a win/loss record of 2/5 with the remaining twelve games all drawn.\n\n===1950s===\nThe [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] visited Canada in 1951, the highlight of which was the first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] game played by the Canadian national team, played in [[Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club Ground|Armour Heights]], Toronto, which was won by the visiting side.<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1952, pp. 898\u2013902.</ref> This was followed in 1954 by a [[Canadian cricket tours of England#First-class matches in 1954|tour to England]] on which Canada played eighteen games, four of which were given first-class status, including one against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] who were also touring England at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1954_ENG_Canada_in_England_1954.html |title=Canada in England, 1954 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> The MCC again visited Canada in 1959 under [[Dennis Silk]], and played a 3-day game against a Canada XI in Toronto which they won by 10 wickets. They were undefeated throughout the tour, winning most of their matches by wide margins, but had a closely fought draw against the [[Toronto Cricket Club]].<ref>''Wisden'' 1960, pp. 870\u201371.</ref> This was the decade when the [[Imperial Cricket Conference]] had plans to grant Canada [[Test cricket|Test status]], but Canada themselves postponed the idea as they felt that the Canadian national team was not of sufficient standard, and that competing against full-members' sides needed some time as they wanted to improve their cricket even domestically. However, things did not go as planned and it would be fifty years before Canada next played a first-class match.\n\n===1960s===\nThe annual series of matches between Canada and the USA continued, alternating between the countries. In the 1963 match in Toronto, [[Ray Nascimento]] scored 176, then a record for the series.\n\n===1970s===\nCanada drew a game against Ireland in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/100/100626.html |title=Canada XI v Ireland, 1973 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=16 September 1973 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and the following year again embarked on a tour of England. The tour was a much lower profile than the 1954 tour, with the games being against club sides, county second XIs, and minor counties. Canada had a 4/6 win/loss record on the tour, with a further six games being drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1974_ENG_Canada_in_England_1974.html |title=Canada in England, 1974|publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> In 1979, Canada participated in the [[1979 ICC Trophy|first]] [[ICC Trophy]]. They reached the final of the competition, which qualified them for the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]], where they played their first [[One Day International]]s. The World Cup was not a successful tournament for the Canadians though, and they failed to progress beyond the first round, losing all three games.\n\n===1980s===\nCanada participated in the ICC Trophy again in [[1982 ICC Trophy|1982]] and [[1986 ICC Trophy|1986]]. They could not repeat their success of 1979 though, and failed to progress beyond the first round on both occasions. Other internationals in the 1980s include a no result game against Ireland in 1981,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/100/100648.html |title=Canada in Ireland, 1981 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=7 June 1981 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> and a 3 wicket loss to [[Barbadian cricket team|Barbados]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/49/49335.html |title=Canada in Barbados, 1987/88 |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=5 November 1987 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe 1990s saw Canada progress up the international ladder, playing in three further ICC Trophy tournaments, their best being a seventh-place finish in [[1997 ICC Trophy|1997]]. They also began competing in West Indian domestic one-day cricket in 1996, and competed in the [[Commonwealth Games]] [[Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games|cricket tournament]] in [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]], though they did not progress beyond the first round.\n\n===2000s===\n2000 saw Canada host the first [[ICC Americas Championship]], a tournament which they won. The following year they embarked on a tour to Sri Lanka, but the highlight of 2001 was their hosting of the ICC Trophy. They finished third in the tournament, which qualified them for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. It was this ICC Trophy tournament that first saw the emergence of [[John Davison (Canadian cricketer)|John Davison]], who was to become one of Canada's most successful players.\n\nCanada played various matches in the buildup to the World Cup, visiting Argentina in April 2002, finishing as runners up to longtime rivals the US in the Americas Championship, swiftly followed by a fifth-place finish in the [[ICC 6 Nations Challenge]] in Namibia. The West Indian A team toured Canada later in the year, and Canada won the one-day series 2\u20131, and drew a two-day game. This was followed by Canada's best performance to date in West Indian domestic one-day cricket, winning two games in their first round group, just missing out on qualification for the semi finals.\n\nThe World Cup itself was a tournament of contrasting fortunes for the Canadians. They started with their first ODI win, over [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]]. Two games later saw them dismissed for 36 against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]], then the lowest score in One Day International history. The next game against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] saw John Davison score the fastest ever World Cup century, although Canada lost that game, and did not progress past the first round.\n{{Cricket match summary\n| date = 11 February 2003\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|CAN}}\n| score1 = 180 (49.1 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|BAN}}\n| score2 = 120 (28 overs)\n| result = Canada won by 60 runs\n| venue = [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead]], [[Durban]], South Africa\n| umpires = [[Aleem Dar]] (Pak) and [[Brian Jerling|BG Jerling]] (SA)\n| motm = [[Austin Codrington|A Codrington]] (Can)\n| runs1 = [[Ian Billcliff|IS Billcliff]] 42 (63)\n| runs2 = [[Sanwar Hossain|S Hossain]] 25 (24)\n| wickets1 = [[Sanwar Hossain|MS Hossain]] 2/26 (10)\n| wickets2 = [[Austin Codrington|A Codrington]] 5/27 (9)\n| scorecard = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65239.html Scorecard]\n| rain = \n}}\n\n===2004\u20132008===\n2006 started badly for Canada, with a last place finish in the Six Nations Challenge in the United Arab Emirates after Canada lost all their games. They had improved significantly by the time of the ICC Americas Championship in [[Bermuda]], which they won. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], finishing as runners up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since [[Jim Laker]]'s 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.\n\nIn 2005, Canada again finished third in the [[2005 ICC Trophy|ICC Trophy]], which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]], as well as qualifying them for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]]. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.\n\nIn 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], beating [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] by 25 runs and [[Bermudian cricket team|Bermuda]] by nine wickets, but their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]].\n\nIn August, Canada took part in the first Division of the Americas Championship. They beat [[Argentine cricket team|Argentina]] and longtime rivals the [[United States cricket team|USA]], but lost to the [[Cayman Islands cricket team|Cayman Islands]] and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.\n\n===2010\u20132014===\n{{Outdated section|date=September 2015}}\nIn June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland.\n\nIn August, Canada travelled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain.\n\nIn late summer of 2008, West Indies and Bermuda came to Canada to play in the Scotiabank One-Day Series against Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda, to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.\n\nDuring the Scotiabank Series the talents of Rizwan Cheema were discovered \u2013 he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost both and tied one match, however in the tie with Zimbabwe, Canada lost by points in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka were eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament was expected to be played annually for the following four years.\n\nIn late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out by rain.\n\nIn April 2009 Canada participated in the 2009 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament. Assembling the best Canadian team in many years, Canada rolled through the opening stages of the event and eventually finished second in the tournament. The impressive display earned Canada a berth in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe ICC announced that the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]] will only have 10 participating teams \u2013 this makes it difficult for the Associate Countries to qualify for the world cup. [[Cricket Canada]] expressed its unhappiness with the reduced world cup<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/canada/content/story/482134.html |title=Canada news: Canada unhappy with reduced World Cup &#124; Canada Cricket News &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo  |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada lost [[One Day International|ODI]] & [[T20I]] status and with no prospect of big-stage international cricket to come until next qualifier, owing to a poor performance at the World Cup Qualifier in New Zealand.\n\n===2015===\n\nThe big event for Canada to make a mark in the year 2015 was the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland. Unfortunately, Canada failed to win a single match and finished at the bottom of Group B.\n\nIn the first match, against Kenya in the picturesque Edinburgh, Canada put together 143 runs in 20 overs with the loss of 5 wickets. In response, Irfan Karim's 54-ball 74 led Kenya to a convincing seven-wicket win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/896727.html|title=Karim 74 guides Kenya to comfortable win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe second match for Canada was against the relative newcomers to the scene, Oman, and was played in Stirling, Scotland. This game was reduced to 13 overs a side, down from 20 due to inclement weather. Canada's batting, after Oman opted to bowl first, was largely put together courtesy of a 25-ball 52 from Nitish Kumar, who scored four fours and three sixes. In response, Zeeshan Maqsood's unbeaten 86, powered Oman to a seven-wicket win with 10 balls to spare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/897911.html|title=Maqsood assault gives Oman big win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada played their third match of the tournament at the same venue in Stirling, Scotland against United Arab Emirates. UAE got off to the ideal start. Aside from winning the coin-toss, they decided to bowl first. Canada, batting first, lost their first 2 wickets in the first 8 balls bowled. It was followed by a solid partnership between Hiral Shah and Nitish Kumar who plundered 58 runs between them. But the tide turned again in UAE's favor as they picked up a heap of wickets to reduce Canada down to 109 for the loss of 9 wickets. But Navneet Dhaliwal came to the rescue with an unbeaten 39 to raise the total to 132 runs at the end of 20 overs. In response, UAE lost their first wicket in the third over but good partnerships for the second (25 runs), third (40 runs) and fourth (19 runs) wickets kept them on track. The match seemed level when the target was whittled down to 33 runs required in three overs which came down to 25 runs required off 12 balls. But, Shakoor and Patil brought UAE home in the last over after plundering Cecil Parvez for 21 runs in his final over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/898625.html|title=Shahzad 56 sets up thrilling five-wicket win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada shifted back to Edinburgh for their fourth match of the tournament against hosts Scotland. Canada had lost the coin-toss again in this match and the home team inserted Canada into batting first. They got off to a quick start, racing to 24 in 2.3 overs before Alasdair Evans dismissed Ruvindu Gunasekara. The other bowlers too did not allow any meaningful partnerships to develop between any of the Canadian batsmen, reducing them to 87 for the loss of 8 wickets by the 16th over. A 48-run, ninth-wicket partnership between Navneet Dhaliwal (34*) and No. 10 Junaid Siddiqui, who scored 28 off 16, took them past the triple-figure mark to help them finish on 135 for 8. In response, Scotland started off brightly \u2013 at a stunning rate of 10 runs per over till the sixth over \u2013 even as Satsimranjit Dhindsa got rid of Calum MacLeod for a 15-ball 29. The wicket didn't cost Scotland much as they went about with the same momentum despite losing Matthew Cross to Dhindsa as well, and cruised to a comfortable win with 32 balls to spare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/899343.html|title=Coetzer fifty hands Scotland easy win|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nCanada played their fifth and final match of the tournament at the same venue in Edinburgh against Netherlands. They lost the toss again and were inserted to bat again. This time though, the batting showed resilience and the team put together a total of 172 for the loss of 8 wickets which came on the back of a half-century from Ruvindu Gunasekera (51) and late blitzes from team captain Rizwan Cheema and wicket-keeper batsman Hamza Tariq. In response, the Netherlands batsmen, particularly Steven Myburgh, Wesley Barresi and Michael Swart led an attacking display of powerful batting to record a solid win for their team with 15 balls to spare. Thus, ending a dismal 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier for the Canada national cricket team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015/content/story/899779.html|title=Myburgh helps Netherlands ace 174 chase|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the dismal performance at the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 qualifier, some positive news followed for the Canada national cricket team players.

The twenty-first named storm of the [[2018 Pacific hurricane season]], Vicente originated from a [[tropical wave]] that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19. Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day. The small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track. Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of {{convert|1002|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] in its [[central dense overcast]]. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen before [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] from the nearby [[Hurricane Willa]] caused further weakening. Vicent weakened into a tropical depression early on October 23 and made [[landfall]] near [[Playa Azul (Michoac\u00e1n)|Playa Azul]] at 13:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. After moving ashore, Vicente quickly fell apart and dissipated a few hours later.\n\nTropical Storm Vicente caused torrential rainfall in the [[Mexico|Mexican states]] of Michoac\u00e1n, [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]], [[Hidalgos]], [[Jalisco]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Colima]]. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states; 13 died in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. [[Plan DN-III-E]] was activated in multiple states to provide aid to a large number of affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs.\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Vicente 2018 track.png}}\nTropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex affiliated with the eastern Pacific [[monsoon trough]] and a [[tropical wave]]. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], arriving at the [[Lesser Antilles]] around October&nbsp;14. Although [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection. The wave came into contact with [[Central America]] on October&nbsp;16; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of [[Panama]] a day later. Bursts of convection occurred to the south of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific.<ref name=\"TCR\">{{cite report |last1=Latto |first1=Andrew |last2=Beven |first2=John |title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Vicente |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/EP232018_Vicente.pdf |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=26 March 2020 |date=10 April 2019}}</ref> The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) first mentioned the system had the potential for tropical development early on October&nbsp;19.

The twenty-first named storm of the [[2018 Pacific hurricane season]], Vicente originated from a [[tropical wave]] that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19. Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day. The small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track. Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of {{convert|1002|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] in its [[central dense overcast]]. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen before [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] from the nearby [[Hurricane Willa]] caused further weakening. Vicent weakened into a tropical depression early on October 23 and made [[landfall]] near [[Playa Azul (Michoac\u00e1n)|Playa Azul]] at 13:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. After moving ashore, Vicente quickly fell apart and dissipated a few hours later.\n\nTropical Storm Vicente caused torrential rainfall in the [[Mexico|Mexican states]] of Michoac\u00e1n, [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]], [[Hidalgos]], [[Jalisco]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Colima]]. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states; 13 died in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. [[Plan DN-III-E]] was activated in multiple states to provide aid to a large number of affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs.\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Vicente 2018 track.png}}\nTropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex affiliated with the eastern Pacific [[monsoon trough]] and a [[tropical wave]]. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], arriving at the [[Lesser Antilles]] around October&nbsp;14. Although [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection. The wave came into contact with [[Central America]] on October&nbsp;16; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of [[Panama]] a day later. Bursts of convection occurred to the south of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific.<ref name=\"TCR\">{{cite report |last1=Latto |first1=Andrew |last2=Beven |first2=John |title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Vicente |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/EP232018_Vicente.pdf |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=26 March 2020 |date=10 April 2019}}</ref> The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) first mentioned the system had the potential for tropical development early on October&nbsp;19.
