HMV's copy was discarded during renovations to their Oxford Street store in the 1960s, but the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection.\n\nMany Allied soldiers made a point of listening to the song at the end of the day. For example, in his memoir ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] describes the song's effect in the spring of 1942 during the [[Western Desert Campaign]]: \"Husky, sensuous, nostalgic, sugar-sweet, her voice seemed to reach out to you, as she lingered over the catchy tune, the sickly sentimental words. Belgrade... The continent of Europe seemed a long way away. I wondered when I would see it again and what it would be like by the time we got there.\"<ref>Part 2, ch 3 \"Outward Bound\"</ref>\n\nThe next year, parachuted into the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav guerrilla war]], Maclean wrote: \"Sometimes at night, before going to sleep, we would turn on our receiving set and listen to Radio Belgrade. For months now, the flower of the Afrika Korps had been languishing behind the barbed wire of Allied prison camps.  But still, punctually at ten o'clock, came Lale Andersen singing their special song, with the same unvarying, heart-rending sweetness that we knew so well from the desert. [...] Belgrade was still remote. But, now [...] it had become our ultimate goal, which Lili Marlene and her nostalgic little tune seemed somehow to symbolise.\"<ref>Part III, ch 3 Orientation</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1944, the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Belgrade]] seemed not far away. \"Then, at ten o'clock, loud and clear, Radio Belgrade; Lili Marlene, sweet, insidious, melancholy. 'Not much longer now,' we would say, as we switched it off.\"<ref>Ch 12 Ratweek</ref> As the [[Red Army]] was advancing on [[Belgrade]], he reflected again on the song. \"At [[Valjevo]], as at so many other places [...] we would tune our wireless sets in the evening to Radio Belgrade, and night after night, always at the same time, would come, throbbing lingeringly over the ether, the cheap, sugary and almost painfully nostalgic melody, the sex-laden, intimate, heart-rending accents of Lili Marlene. 'Not gone yet,' we would say to each other. 'I wonder if we'll find her when we get there.' Then one evening at the accustomed time there was silence. 'Gone away,' we said.\"<ref>Part 3, ch 13 \"Grand Finale\" in ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'' by [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], 1949</ref>\n\nAllied soldiers in Italy later adapted the tune to their own lyrics, creating the \"[[D-Day Dodgers]]\" song.  A cartoon by [[Bill Mauldin]] in the American army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' shows two soldiers in a foxhole, one playing a harmonica, while the other comments, \"The krauts ain't following ya too good on 'Lili Marlene' tonight, Joe.

In one scene she walks down a rubbled street, ravaged by Allied attacks, with [[Spencer Tracy]]'s character. As they approach a bar they hear men inside singing \"Lili Marleen\" in German. Dietrich begins to sing along with the song, translating a few lyrics for Tracy, referring to the German lyrics as \"much darker\" than the English.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOExL4Tujs| title=a scene from \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" with Marlene Dietrich and Spencer Tracy| publisher=[[YouTube]]| accessdate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n \nWhile she was touring the world in live [[One-person show|one-woman]] cabaret shows from 1953 to 1975, the song was part of Dietrich's usual line-up, usually following \"[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]\". She always introduced the song with some variation of this quote, from a 1960s concert, somewhere in Europe:\n\n{{quote|Now, here is a song that is very close to my heart. I sang it during the war. I sang it for three long years, all through Africa, Sicily, Italy, to Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, to England, through France, through Belgium ... [long pause] ... to Germany, and to Czechoslovakia.

A version called \"The [[D-Day Dodgers]]\" with words by Harry Pynn was sung by the allied troops in Italy once the Normandy invasion had begun in 1944. A recording was made by [[Perry Como]] on 27 June 1944 and issued by [[RCA Victor]] on 78 rpm (catalog number 20-1592-A) with the flip side \"First Class Private Mary Brown\". This recording was later re-issued as catalog number 20-2824-A with flip side \"I Love You Truly\". The song reached chart position #13 on the [[United States]] charts. The song was recorded during the [[1942\u201343 musicians' strike|musicians' strike]] and consequently has a backing chorus instead of an orchestral backup. A version with French words by Henri Lemarchand was recorded by [[Suzy Solidor]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Henri+Lemarchand?anv=H.+Lemarchand |title=Henri Lemarchand Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nOther artists who recorded the song included [[Hildegarde]] (on [[Decca Records|Decca]]),<ref>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|2|B |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633232/m1/#track/2 }}</ref> [[Bing Crosby]] (recorded 30 December 1947),<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> [[Martha Tilton]] (on [[Coral Records|Coral]]), and [[Vaughn Monroe]] (on [[V-Disc]]). Al Martino revived the song for [[Capitol Records]] in 1968. Another version was recorded in the 1960s by [[Hank Locklin]], [[Connie Francis]] and [[Vera Lynn]]. A German version of the song also covered by [[Lolita (Austrian singer)|Edith 'Lolita' Zuser]]. An instrumental version was also covered by [[Billy Vaughn]]. [[Hank Snow]] also recorded a version in 1963 on his album \"I've Been Everywhere\". Another [[French people|French]] singer, [[Patricia Kaas]] used \"Lili Marlene\" as an [[Introduction (music)|intro]] for her song \"D'Allemagne\" and sang the entire song during concerts in the 1990s. [[Matia Bazar]] ([[Italy]]) recorded an uptempo beat song called \"Lili Marleen\" on her 1982 album ''Berlino, Parigi, Londra''. The song is a \"spoken words\" early 1980s dance track. [[Spain|Spanish]] group [[Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 (band)|Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9]], led by [[Marta S\u00e1nchez]], released an electro-pop version of the song in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAdivio0Fo |title=Ole Ole - Lili Marlen 1986 |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref> It became one of the best-selling singles in [[Spain]] of the 1980s, and paved way for the singer to have a successful career. The song was eventually included in the also best-selling album ''Bailando sin salir de casa'' in 1986. German blackmetal band [[Eisregen]] recorded a version of \"Lili Marlene\" on their album ''Hexenhaus''. The German [[Gothic metal]]/[[Industrial metal]] band [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]] released the song in both languages (English & German) on ''[[Gemini (Atrocity album)|Gemini]]'': on the blue edition was the German version, and on the red edition was the English version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=7750 |title=Atrocity - Gemini - Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=The Metal Archives |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref> [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]] included an uptempo, disco-influenced version of \"Lili Marlene\", with German lyrics sung by Coconut Adriana Kaegi, on their 1980 debut LP release ''[[Off the Coast of Me]]''. [[Carly Simon]] recorded the song as the third track on her 1997 Arista CD ''Film Noir''. It has also been translated into Hawaiian by [[Kiope Raymond]], and recorded by Raymond and [[Pearl Rose]] on Rose's 2000 album ''Homecoming''. Most recently it was recorded by [[Neil Hannon]] of the Irish pop group [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] as a B-side to the 2006 single \"A Lady of a Certain Age\". A slow-tempo [[instrumental]] version can be found on the compilation LP, ''Vienna: City of Dreams'', by the Austrian zither master [[Anton Karas]]. \"Lili Marlene\" has been adopted as the regimental slow march by the [[Special Air Service]], [[Australian Special Air Service|Special Air Service Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], and its melody is the basis of the official march of [[Kodam III/Siliwangi]] in the [[Indonesian Army]].\n\nDuring WWII Soviet counterpropaganda officer (and future dissident) [[Lev Kopelev]] wrote a mockery parody of the original song for demoralization of enemy soldiers. The original text (in German) of this parody is lost, but famous Russian poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] wrote a poem in Russian, based on this parody.<ref>http://a-pesni.org/drugije/lilimarlen-ru.htm</ref> The poem is quite different from the original German song, though many Russians think the Brodsky version is an exact translation.\n\n==Other interpretations==\n\nIt has been sung and marched as 'passacaille' and slow march by the [[Military of Chile]] in its adaptation to the Spanish Language. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYxCkEkPM8&t=33s See the following video as an example.]\n\nIt is also adapted to Indonesian as \"March of Siliwangi Division\" of the Indonesian Army. It was first sung by the [[Kodam III/Siliwangi|Siliwangi Division]] while marching from West Java to Yogyakarta as a result of the Renville Agreement with the Dutch Government in February 1948. The song has 2 languages in 1 song, Indonesian and Sundanese (language used by the people of West Java). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voe1FOi89dU See following song.]\n\n[[Humphrey Jennings]] directed the 29-minute-long film ''[[The True Story of Lili Marlene]]'' in 1944 about the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139670/ |title=The True Story of Lilli Marlene (1944) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe song features prominently in ''[[Lili Marlene (film)|Lili Marlene]]'' (1950), starring [[Lisa Daniely]]. The film tells a fictionalised version of the story of the woman (played by Daniely) who purportedly inspired the song.\n\nThe song is sung in a bar in Germany in the 1961 film ''[[Judgement at Nuremberg]]''.  In a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] (who famously recorded the song several times), and [[Spencer Tracy]], Dietrich's character explains to Tracy's that the German words are much sadder than the English translations.\n\nThe song's popularity among both Allied and Axis troops in the Western Desert front during World War Two was described in the British television program ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]]'', a signal documentary series broadcast in 1973-74 and narrated by [[Laurence Olivier]], in Episode 8, \"The Desert: North Africa 1940-1943\".\n\n[[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] directed the 1980 film ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'', the story of Lale Andersen and her version of the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082661/ |title=Lili Marleen (1981) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe song is featured prominently in a scene of a 1983 [[Cinema of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian film]] ''[[Balkan Express]]'' set during World War II. In the scene, a bar singer (portrayed by popular [[Serbian folk music|folk]] singer [[Toma Zdravkovi\u0107]]) refuses to sing the song to some German soldiers who then escort him out of the bar. Later in the scene, he returns to the stage and is depicted singing the song with blood on his face, implying he had been persuaded into singing by beating.\n\nIn the 1983 film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', a group of German rocket scientists working for [[NASA]] sing the song around a piano in a bar the night before one of the space flights.\n\nThe song appears several times during the World War II-themed 1988-1989 television miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance (miniseries)|War and Remembrance]]''. On the Allied side, it is played during a party attended by some of the British and American characters, prompting the British journalist Philip Rule to sarcastically lament that the only memorable song to come out of the war would be \"a cheap Hun ballad.\"  On the German side, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men riding on the train taking the last [[Theresienstadt]] Jews to [[Auschwitz]] slowly sing it.\n\nEstonian [[punk rock]] band [[Vennaskond]] released an [[Estonian language|Estonian]] version of the song on their album ''Usk. Lootus. Armastus.'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vennaskond |publisher=Atmosphere Music |location=Belgium |url=http://www.atmosphere.be/releases/vennaskond |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> Another Estonian group, Swing Swindlers, recorded a melancholy swinging version in 2007 (both in German and Estonian) and featured the song in their film ''Berlin 1945: Musik Unter Bomben'' with vocals by [[Mart Sander]], Kelli Uustani, [[Nele-Liis Vaiksoo]], and Pirjo Levandi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lili Marleen - The Swing Swindlers |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-06-25 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0WjLbYWD8c/ |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 film ''[[Bad Day to Go Fishing]]'', directed by [[Alvaro Brechner]], showed an uncontrollable titan ([[Jouko Ahola]]) who could only be appeased by the melody of \"Lili Marlene\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1388402/ |title=Bad Day to Go Fishing (2009) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nBritish singer-songwriter [[Katy Carr]] featured this song in English on her album ''Coquette'' (2009).\n\nDutch [[Folk music|folk]] band [[Omnia (band)|Omnia]] recorded a version of the song on their 2011 album ''Musick and Po\u00ebtree''.\n\nIt is often used as a song on the ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' round [[One Song to the Tune of Another]].  Whenever it is used, jokes are often made to the German heritage of the song, by making allusions to the Third Reich. (The song \"Bermuda Triangle\" was sung to the tune of \"Lili Marlene\" in one episode of the show.)\n\nThe song is referenced by Leonard Cohen in his 1971 released song, Famous Blue Raincoat.\n\nSpanish singer Marta S\u00e1nchez sang a Spanish version both solo, and with her band Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9.\n\nIn 2019 TV series [[Pennyworth (TV series)|Pennyworth]], the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] veterans, to whom the main character belongs, use Lili Marleen as their funeral march.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andersen, Lale (1981).

HMV's copy was discarded during renovations to their Oxford Street store in the 1960s, but the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection.\n\nMany Allied soldiers made a point of listening to the song at the end of the day. For example, in his memoir ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] describes the song's effect in the spring of 1942 during the [[Western Desert Campaign]]: \"Husky, sensuous, nostalgic, sugar-sweet, her voice seemed to reach out to you, as she lingered over the catchy tune, the sickly sentimental words. Belgrade... The continent of Europe seemed a long way away. I wondered when I would see it again and what it would be like by the time we got there.\"<ref>Part 2, ch 3 \"Outward Bound\"</ref>\n\nThe next year, parachuted into the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav guerrilla war]], Maclean wrote: \"Sometimes at night, before going to sleep, we would turn on our receiving set and listen to Radio Belgrade. For months now, the flower of the Afrika Korps had been languishing behind the barbed wire of Allied prison camps.  But still, punctually at ten o'clock, came Lale Andersen singing their special song, with the same unvarying, heart-rending sweetness that we knew so well from the desert. [...] Belgrade was still remote. But, now [...] it had become our ultimate goal, which Lili Marlene and her nostalgic little tune seemed somehow to symbolise.\"<ref>Part III, ch 3 Orientation</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1944, the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Belgrade]] seemed not far away. \"Then, at ten o'clock, loud and clear, Radio Belgrade; Lili Marlene, sweet, insidious, melancholy. 'Not much longer now,' we would say, as we switched it off.\"<ref>Ch 12 Ratweek</ref> As the [[Red Army]] was advancing on [[Belgrade]], he reflected again on the song. \"At [[Valjevo]], as at so many other places [...] we would tune our wireless sets in the evening to Radio Belgrade, and night after night, always at the same time, would come, throbbing lingeringly over the ether, the cheap, sugary and almost painfully nostalgic melody, the sex-laden, intimate, heart-rending accents of Lili Marlene. 'Not gone yet,' we would say to each other. 'I wonder if we'll find her when we get there.' Then one evening at the accustomed time there was silence. 'Gone away,' we said.\"<ref>Part 3, ch 13 \"Grand Finale\" in ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'' by [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], 1949</ref>\n\nAllied soldiers in Italy later adapted the tune to their own lyrics, creating the \"[[D-Day Dodgers]]\" song.  A cartoon by [[Bill Mauldin]] in the American army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' shows two soldiers in a foxhole, one playing a harmonica, while the other comments, \"The krauts ain't following ya too good on 'Lili Marlene' tonight, Joe.

It has also been translated into Hawaiian by [[Kiope Raymond]], and recorded by Raymond and [[Pearl Rose]] on Rose's 2000 album ''Homecoming''. Most recently it was recorded by [[Neil Hannon]] of the Irish pop group [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] as a B-side to the 2006 single \"A Lady of a Certain Age\". A slow-tempo [[instrumental]] version can be found on the compilation LP, ''Vienna: City of Dreams'', by the Austrian zither master [[Anton Karas]]. \"Lili Marlene\" has been adopted as the regimental slow march by the [[Special Air Service]], [[Australian Special Air Service|Special Air Service Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], and its melody is the basis of the official march of [[Kodam III/Siliwangi]] in the [[Indonesian Army]].\n\nDuring WWII Soviet counterpropaganda officer (and future dissident) [[Lev Kopelev]] wrote a mockery parody of the original song for demoralization of enemy soldiers. The original text (in German) of this parody is lost, but famous Russian poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] wrote a poem in Russian, based on this parody.<ref>http://a-pesni.org/drugije/lilimarlen-ru.htm</ref> The poem is quite different from the original German song, though many Russians think the Brodsky version is an exact translation.\n\n==Other interpretations==\n\nIt has been sung and marched as 'passacaille' and slow march by the [[Military of Chile]] in its adaptation to the Spanish Language. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYxCkEkPM8&t=33s See the following video as an example.]\n\nIt is also adapted to Indonesian as \"March of Siliwangi Division\" of the Indonesian Army. It was first sung by the [[Kodam III/Siliwangi|Siliwangi Division]] while marching from West Java to Yogyakarta as a result of the Renville Agreement with the Dutch Government in February 1948. The song has 2 languages in 1 song, Indonesian and Sundanese (language used by the people of West Java). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voe1FOi89dU See following song.]\n\n[[Humphrey Jennings]] directed the 29-minute-long film ''[[The True Story of Lili Marlene]]'' in 1944 about the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139670/ |title=The True Story of Lilli Marlene (1944) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe song features prominently in ''[[Lili Marlene (film)|Lili Marlene]]'' (1950), starring [[Lisa Daniely]]. The film tells a fictionalised version of the story of the woman (played by Daniely) who purportedly inspired the song.\n\nThe song is sung in a bar in Germany in the 1961 film ''[[Judgement at Nuremberg]]''.  In a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] (who famously recorded the song several times), and [[Spencer Tracy]], Dietrich's character explains to Tracy's that the German words are much sadder than the English translations.\n\nThe song's popularity among both Allied and Axis troops in the Western Desert front during World War Two was described in the British television program ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]]'', a signal documentary series broadcast in 1973-74 and narrated by [[Laurence Olivier]], in Episode 8, \"The Desert: North Africa 1940-1943\".\n\n[[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] directed the 1980 film ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'', the story of Lale Andersen and her version of the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082661/ |title=Lili Marleen (1981) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe song is featured prominently in a scene of a 1983 [[Cinema of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian film]] ''[[Balkan Express]]'' set during World War II. In the scene, a bar singer (portrayed by popular [[Serbian folk music|folk]] singer [[Toma Zdravkovi\u0107]]) refuses to sing the song to some German soldiers who then escort him out of the bar. Later in the scene, he returns to the stage and is depicted singing the song with blood on his face, implying he had been persuaded into singing by beating.\n\nIn the 1983 film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', a group of German rocket scientists working for [[NASA]] sing the song around a piano in a bar the night before one of the space flights.\n\nThe song appears several times during the World War II-themed 1988-1989 television miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance (miniseries)|War and Remembrance]]''. On the Allied side, it is played during a party attended by some of the British and American characters, prompting the British journalist Philip Rule to sarcastically lament that the only memorable song to come out of the war would be \"a cheap Hun ballad.\"  On the German side, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men riding on the train taking the last [[Theresienstadt]] Jews to [[Auschwitz]] slowly sing it.\n\nEstonian [[punk rock]] band [[Vennaskond]] released an [[Estonian language|Estonian]] version of the song on their album ''Usk. Lootus. Armastus.'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vennaskond |publisher=Atmosphere Music |location=Belgium |url=http://www.atmosphere.be/releases/vennaskond |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> Another Estonian group, Swing Swindlers, recorded a melancholy swinging version in 2007 (both in German and Estonian) and featured the song in their film ''Berlin 1945: Musik Unter Bomben'' with vocals by [[Mart Sander]], Kelli Uustani, [[Nele-Liis Vaiksoo]], and Pirjo Levandi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lili Marleen - The Swing Swindlers |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-06-25 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0WjLbYWD8c/ |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 film ''[[Bad Day to Go Fishing]]'', directed by [[Alvaro Brechner]], showed an uncontrollable titan ([[Jouko Ahola]]) who could only be appeased by the melody of \"Lili Marlene\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1388402/ |title=Bad Day to Go Fishing (2009) |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>\n\nBritish singer-songwriter [[Katy Carr]] featured this song in English on her album ''Coquette'' (2009).\n\nDutch [[Folk music|folk]] band [[Omnia (band)|Omnia]] recorded a version of the song on their 2011 album ''Musick and Po\u00ebtree''.\n\nIt is often used as a song on the \"[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]\" round [[One Song to the Tune of Another]].  Whenever it is used, jokes are often made to the German heritage of the song, by making allusions to the Third Reich. (The song \"Bermuda Triangle\" was sung to the tune of \"Lili Marlene\" in one episode of the show.)\n\nThe song is referenced by Leonard Cohen in his 1971 released song, Famous Blue Raincoat.\n\nSpanish singer Marta S\u00e1nchez sang a Spanish version both solo, and with her band Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9.\n\nIn 2019 TV series [[Pennyworth (TV series)|Pennyworth]], the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] veterans, to whom the main character belongs, use Lili Marleen as their funeral march.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andersen, Lale (1981).

Founded in 1996 by [[Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d]] in [[Prague]] as the first web portal in the Czech Republic. Seznam started with a [[search engine]] and an internet version of [[yellow pages]]. Today, Seznam runs more than 15 different web services and associated brands. Seznam had more than 6 million real users per month at the end of 2014.<ref>[http://eng.kurzy.cz/netmonitor/seznam-cz Netmonitor Seznam.cz] Results of Netmonitor web analytics project at kurzy.cz</ref> Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are its homepage seznam.cz, email.cz, search.seznam.cz and its yellow pages firmy.cz.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Czech market, Seznam.cz was until 2008 in competition with the portals [[Centrum.cz]] and [[Atlas.cz]]. These two portals, despite merging in 2008, no longer appear likely to overcome Seznam in the near future. Seznam's biggest competitor now appears to be global [[Google]], especially in the area of full-text search.\n\nAs of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam was the second [[internet search]] engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}. By August 2014, still according to Toplist's statistics, Seznam's share of searches had further eroded to 38%.\n\nSeznam, like four other companies in the world, was{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} for a long time the number one search engine in its region. Other such search engines are [[Baidu]] ([[China]]), [[Naver]] ([[South Korea]]), [[Yahoo Japan]] ([[Japan]]) and [[Yandex]] ([[Russia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2008/09/standing-between-google-and-world-domination.html|title=Standing Between Google and World Domination|work=marketingpilgrim.com}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011, Seznam has used as its slogan a Czech rhyme ''Seznam - najdu tam, co hled\u00e1m'' (''Seznam - I find there, what I search for''). Prior to this its slogan was ''Seznam - najdu tam, co nezn\u00e1m'' (''Seznam - I find there, what I don't know''). In 2012, the slogan was reverted to the original one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-58923480-seznam-najdu-tam-co-neznam-ivo-lukacovic-se-vraci-do-firmy-a-s-nim-i-stary-slogan|title=Seznam, najdu tam, co nezn\u00e1m: Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d se vrac\u00ed do firmy a s n\u00edm i star\u00fd slogan|first=|last=\u010cTK|date=7 December 2012|website=Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 noviny}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nFounded by [[Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d]] in 1996, Seznam began as the first internet [[yellow pages]] and [[search engine]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. Ivo started his business with 50,000 [[CZK]] he had saved up.  In 1998, Seznam added email to its portfolio, with email accounts running on the ''@seznam.cz'' domain.  Since then, more brands and services have come on-line.  Since 2001, Seznam has included financial, social and political news, TV programs, weather forecasts, dictionaries, maps and community services.\n\nIn 2000, [[Spray International]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] web portal company, invested in Seznam.  At that time Seznam became a [[joint stock company]].  Until 2000, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d was self-employed and Seznam was his own sole business.  With the investment, it is estimated that Spray International acquired around 30% share of Seznam.  Exact numbers are not known, as Luka\u010dovi\u010d and Seznam officials have never released any details about the transaction.{{citation needed|date = May 2015}}  What has been confirmed, though, is that Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d retained at least 70% of Seznam stock after the investment.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}\n\nSpray acquired a stake in Seznam with the intention of making an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]; however, Spray never reached that goal.  After the [[dot-com bubble]] burst in 2000, Spray abandoned the idea.  There are rumors about Spray defaulting on its obligations to Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d by not making an IPO.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} In 2003, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d increased the base capital of Seznam without Spray and became 70% owner of Seznam.  Since 2003, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d has remained the controlling shareholder of Seznam.\n\nUntil 2003, Seznam had been using a fulltext engine from the Czech company Jyxo; however, in 2005, Seznam replaced that search engine with its own technology.  Also in 2005, Seznam acquired the Czech firm ATC which was, among other ventures, running the email server Email.cz.  Email services Email.cz and Seznam.cz have now merged.\n\nIn 2006, Seznam moved its headquarters from [[Prague]] [[Ko\u0161\u00ed\u0159e]] to a more prominent location in the [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|Prague And\u011bl]].  That year, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d gave up the day-to-day business direction of Seznam, and Pavel Zima became CEO. In the Fall of 2006, Seznam acquired all email users from another web portal, \"Czech On Line\", with the domain ''@post.cz''.\n\nSeznam bought 50% of Global Inspiration, a Czech company running a video portal Stream.cz, similar to the global [[YouTube]] in 2007. [[Lycos Europe]] (a subsequent incarnation of Spray International) sold its 30% share in Seznam to [[Tiger Management|Tiger Holding]] and Miura International.  Lycos received more than 1.7 billion [[CZK]] from this transaction.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As of 2015, Miura International S.a.r.l. had 5,6% of shares, Tiger holding four S.a.r.l. had 24,4% of shares and Helifreak limited had 70% of shares.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://or.justice.cz/ias/content/download?id=5133022cfa1b44e0ac1a568b0c386548|title=General meeting of stakeholders|date=17 September 2015|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the Czech media reported on alleged meetings between Seznam and [[Goldman Sachs]] representatives to find a buyer for Seznam. Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d and Seznam representatives denied this. Such speculation ended with the start of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial crisis]] in [[Europe]] in late 2008.\n\nThe EU believes Google overtook Seznam.cz around 2011 in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite news |title=Antitrust: Commission fines Google \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing dominance as search engine by giving illegal advantage to own comparison shopping service - Factsheet |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_17_1785 |accessdate=2 December 2019 |work=European Commission |ref=27 June 2017}}</ref> According to the data from ad marketing agency eVisions, Seznam still held a majority share of the Czech search market at the start of 2014, but that Google pulled ahead in the second half of that year.

Seznam had more than 6 million real users per month at the end of 2014.<ref>[http://eng.kurzy.cz/netmonitor/seznam-cz Netmonitor Seznam.cz] Results of Netmonitor web analytics project at kurzy.cz</ref> Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are its homepage seznam.cz, email.cz, search.seznam.cz and its yellow pages firmy.cz.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Czech market, Seznam.cz was until 2008 in competition with the portals [[Centrum.cz]] and [[Atlas.cz]]. These two portals, despite merging in 2008, no longer appear likely to overcome Seznam in the near future. Seznam's biggest competitor now appears to be global [[Google]], especially in the area of full-text search.\n\nAs of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam was the second [[internet search]] engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}. By August 2014, still according to Toplist's statistics, Seznam's share of searches had further eroded to 38%.\n\nSeznam, like four other companies in the world, was{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} for a long time the number one search engine in its region. Other such search engines are [[Baidu]] ([[China]]), [[Naver]] ([[South Korea]]), [[Yahoo Japan]] ([[Japan]]) and [[Yandex]] ([[Russia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2008/09/standing-between-google-and-world-domination.html|title=Standing Between Google and World Domination|work=marketingpilgrim.com}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011, Seznam has used as its slogan a Czech rhyme ''Seznam - najdu tam, co hled\u00e1m'' (''Seznam - I find there, what I search for''). Prior to this its slogan was ''Seznam - najdu tam, co nezn\u00e1m'' (''Seznam - I find there, what I don't know''). In 2012, the slogan was reverted to the original one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-58923480-seznam-najdu-tam-co-neznam-ivo-lukacovic-se-vraci-do-firmy-a-s-nim-i-stary-slogan|title=Seznam, najdu tam, co nezn\u00e1m: Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d se vrac\u00ed do firmy a s n\u00edm i star\u00fd slogan|first=|last=\u010cTK|date=7 December 2012|website=Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 noviny}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nFounded by [[Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d]] in 1996, Seznam began as the first internet [[yellow pages]] and [[search engine]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. Ivo started his business with 50,000 [[CZK]] he had saved up.  In 1998, Seznam added email to its portfolio, with email accounts running on the ''@seznam.cz'' domain.  Since then, more brands and services have come on-line.  Since 2001, Seznam has included financial, social and political news, TV programs, weather forecasts, dictionaries, maps and community services.\n\nIn 2000, [[Spray International]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] web portal company, invested in Seznam.  At that time Seznam became a [[joint stock company]].  Until 2000, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d was self-employed and Seznam was his own sole business.  With the investment, it is estimated that Spray International acquired around 30% share of Seznam.  Exact numbers are not known, as Luka\u010dovi\u010d and Seznam officials have never released any details about the transaction.{{citation needed|date = May 2015}}  What has been confirmed, though, is that Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d retained at least 70% of Seznam stock after the investment.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}\n\nSpray acquired a stake in Seznam with the intention of making an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]; however, Spray never reached that goal.  After the [[dot-com bubble]] burst in 2000, Spray abandoned the idea.  There are rumors about Spray defaulting on its obligations to Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d by not making an IPO.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} In 2003, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d increased the base capital of Seznam without Spray and became 70% owner of Seznam.  Since 2003, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d has remained the controlling shareholder of Seznam.\n\nUntil 2003, Seznam had been using a fulltext engine from the Czech company Jyxo; however, in 2005, Seznam replaced that search engine with its own technology.  Also in 2005, Seznam acquired the Czech firm ATC which was, among other ventures, running the email server Email.cz.  Email services Email.cz and Seznam.cz have now merged.\n\nIn 2006, Seznam moved its headquarters from [[Prague]] [[Ko\u0161\u00ed\u0159e]] to a more prominent location in the [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|Prague And\u011bl]].  That year, Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d gave up the day-to-day business direction of Seznam, and Pavel Zima became CEO. In the Fall of 2006, Seznam acquired all email users from another web portal, \"Czech On Line\", with the domain ''@post.cz''.\n\nSeznam bought 50% of Global Inspiration, a Czech company running a video portal Stream.cz, similar to the global [[YouTube]] in 2007. [[Lycos Europe]] (a subsequent incarnation of Spray International) sold its 30% share in Seznam to [[Tiger Management|Tiger Holding]] and Miura International.  Lycos received more than 1.7 billion [[CZK]] from this transaction.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As of 2015, Miura International S.a.r.l. had 5,6% of shares, Tiger holding four S.a.r.l. had 24,4% of shares and Helifreak limited had 70% of shares.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://or.justice.cz/ias/content/download?id=5133022cfa1b44e0ac1a568b0c386548|title=General meeting of stakeholders|date=17 September 2015|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the Czech media reported on alleged meetings between Seznam and [[Goldman Sachs]] representatives to find a buyer for Seznam. Ivo Luka\u010dovi\u010d and Seznam representatives denied this. Such speculation ended with the start of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|financial crisis]] in [[Europe]] in late 2008.\n\nThe EU believes Google overtook Seznam.cz around 2011 in the Czech Republic<ref>{{cite news |title=Antitrust: Commission fines Google \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing dominance as search engine by giving illegal advantage to own comparison shopping service - Factsheet |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_17_1785 |accessdate=2 December 2019 |work=European Commission |ref=27 June 2017}}</ref>. According to the data from ad marketing agency eVisions, Seznam still held a majority share of the Czech search market at the start of 2014, but that Google pulled ahead in the second half of that year. Google\u2019s share of search on the Czech internet at 74% as of the end of 2018, while Seznam\u2019s share at 26%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kos |first1=Ladislav |title=Infographics: The search engines Google and Seznam on the Czech Internet #2019 |url=https://www.evisions-advertising.com/infographics-the-search-engines-google-and-seznam-on-the-czech-internet-2019/ |accessdate=2 December 2019 |date=|work=eVisions}}</ref>\n\nSince 2016, Seznam.cz is operating its own internet news [[Seznam Zpr\u00e1vy]].

His  father Abdul Rehman was a well respected businessman. He came from a family that held education as a top priority in the upbringing of their children. Khalil was a bright student. He started writing from a very young age. His stories  were published in children\u2019s popular magazines. However the family discouraged him because  a writer or poet was not the most economically viable profession. He went on to study for higher education and started his career with National Bank of Pakistan and was posted to Kotli Azad Kashmir. Later Khalil ur Rehman joined Bank of Punjab Pakistan as Asst. Vice President.  Khalid was engaged to Rukhsana Amin who later passed away. His Autobiographical play [https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4708708/ Sadkay Tumharay]  is a tribute to his first love. The drama garnered great critical accolades. Love & Sufism were the main themes of the play. This was the first time any writer had with complete honesty & bravery presented his personal life on screen. Khalil ur Rehman's first wife is Rubi Naz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brandsynario.com/mere-paas-tum-ho-writer-khalil-ur-rehman-slammed-for-second-marriage/|title='Mere Paas Tum Ho' Writer Khalil-ur-Rehman Slammed for Second Marriage|last=Sachwani|first=Anusha|date=2020-01-13|website=Brandsynario|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Khalil-ur-Rehman {{!}} Mere Paas Tum Ho - Writer {{!}} Aik Din Geo Kay Sath|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjtbeB0sP8|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>  Later Khalil ur Rehman did one more marriage with his second wife Rozina Qureshi, an actress & erstwhile wife of actor Faysal Qureshi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/269313-khalil-ur-rehman-qamars-step-daughter-comes-out-in-support-of-him-against-trolls|title=Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar's step daughter comes out in support of him against trolls|website=www.geo.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Khalil ur Rehman has one step daughter Hanish Qureshi, two children from Rozina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/269313-khalil-ur-rehman-qamars-step-daughter-comes-out-in-support-of-him-against-trolls|title=Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar\u2019s step daughter comes out in support of him against trolls|website=www.geo.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> & two children from Rubi Naz. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum Award Best Writer Drama Serial}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qamar, Khalil-ur-Rehman}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Pakistani writers]]\n[[Category:Pakistani dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Pakistani male television actors]]\n[[Category:Pakistani film directors]]\n[[Category:Pakistani lyricists]]\n[[Category:Punjabi people]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Pakistani English|date=December 2019}}{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar\n| image              = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| birth_name         = \n| birth_date         = \n| birth_place        = \n| death_date         = \n| death_place        = \n| occupation         = {{flatlist|\n*Playwright\n*Lyricist\n*Actor\n*Director\n*Producer\n}}\n| children\u2019s         = SurkabKhalil ,HijabKhalil\n| alma_mater         = \n| known_for          = ''[[Meray Paas Tum Ho]]'', ''[[Boota from Toba Tek Singh]]'', ''[[Landa Bazar (TV series)|Landa Bazar]]'', ''[[Pyarey Afzal]]''\n| notable_works      =''[[Pyarey Afzal]]''<br>''[[Meray Paas Tum Ho]]''\n| education          = Master's degree in commerce\n| nationality        = [[Pakistani]]\n| awards             = \n}}'''Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u062e\u0644\u06cc\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u0645\u0631}}}}) is a [[Pakistani]] writer, director, lyricist and occasional actor known for such dramas as ''[[Pyarey Afzal]]'' (2013), ''[[Sadqay Tumhare]]'' (2014) and most recently the top-rated ''[[Meray Paas Tum Ho]]'' (2019-2020), as well as the 2019 [[Inter-Services Public Relations|ISPR]]-produced film ''[[Kaaf Kangana]]''. \n \n\n\n==Early life and career==\nKhalil ur Rehman Qamar was born in 1962 in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]].

He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses. Memories of his travels around the world infuse all his designs, forming his imaginary scrapbook of colors, textures, rhythms and fragrances. These inspirations materialize into exciting designs that instill in women who wear them a feeling of well being and self-confidence.\n\n=== Other notable accomplishments ===\nIn 2001, Bonnelly held the position as Creative Director for Citrine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico Moda |url=http://www.puertoricomoda.com/REVISTA_PR_MODA_Rev6%5B1%5D.pdf |publisher=Puerto Rica Moda |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2002, he designed<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Celia Cruz|url=http://www.megalatina.fm/eventos/museo-celia-cruz/|publisher=Mega Latina|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> [[Celia Cruz]]'s dress for the [[Latin Grammy Awards]].

He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses. Memories of his travels around the world infuse all his designs, forming his imaginary scrapbook of colors, textures, rhythms and fragrances. These inspirations materialize into exciting designs that instill in women who wear them a feeling of well being and self-confidence.\n\n=== Other notable accomplishments ===\nIn 2001, Bonnelly held the position as Creative Director for Citrine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico Moda |url=http://www.puertoricomoda.com/REVISTA_PR_MODA_Rev6%5B1%5D.pdf |publisher=Puerto Rica Moda |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2002, he designed<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Celia Cruz|url=http://www.megalatina.fm/eventos/museo-celia-cruz/|publisher=Mega Latina|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> [[Celia Cruz]]'s dress for the [[Latin Grammy Awards]].

[[Gerrard Winstanley]]'s followers were known as '''True Levellers''' in 1649 and later became known as ''Diggers,'' because of their attempts to farm on common land.\n\nTheir original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].<ref>Acts 4:32, Today's English Version: \"The group of believers was one in mind and heart. No one said that any of his belongings was his own, but they all shared with one another everything they had.\"</ref><ref>\"[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/863 The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D]\" specifically mentions Acts 4.32</ref> The Diggers tried (by \"levelling\" [[land (economics)|land]]) to reform the existing [[social order]] with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small, [[egalitarian]] rural communities. They were one of a number of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] [[English Dissenters|dissenting groups]] that emerged around this time.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\nThe year 1649 was a time of great social unrest in England. The [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] had won the [[English Civil War#The First English Civil War|First English Civil War]] but failed to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the defeated King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. When members of Parliament and the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandees]] in the [[New Model Army]] were faced with Charles' perceived duplicity, they tried and executed him.\n\nGovernment through the King's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] was replaced with a new body called the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which due to fundamental disagreements within a weakened Parliament was dominated by the Army. Many people became active in politics, suggesting alternative forms of government to replace the old order.\n\nRoyalists wished to place King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] on the throne; men like [[Oliver Cromwell]] wished to govern with a [[plutocratic]] Parliament voted in by an electorate based on [[property]], similar to that which was enfranchised before the civil war; agitators called [[Levellers]], influenced by the writings of [[John Lilburne]], wanted parliamentary government based on an electorate of every male head of a household; [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] advocated a [[theocracy]]; and the Diggers, led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], advocated a more radical solution.\n\n==Theory==\nIn 1649 [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and 14 others published a pamphlet<ref name=\"true_levellers\">[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/863 ''The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men'']\n</ref> in which they called themselves the \"True Levellers\" to distinguish their ideas from those of the [[Levellers]]. Once they put their idea into practice and started to cultivate common land, both opponents and supporters began to call them \"Diggers\". The Diggers' beliefs were informed by Winstanley's writings which envisioned an ecological interrelationship between humans and nature, acknowledging the inherent connections between people and their surroundings.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Winstanley declared that \"true freedom lies where a man receives his nourishment and preservation, and that is in the use of the earth\".<ref>Grant, Neil. ''Hamlyn Children's History of Britain: From the Stone Age to the Present Day'', 2nd Rev edition (Dean, 1992), p.144</ref>\n\nAn undercurrent of political thought which has run through English society for many generations and resurfaced from time to time (for example, in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381) was present in some of the political factions of the 17th century, including those who formed the Diggers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It involved the common belief that England had become subjugated by the \"[[Norman Yoke]]\". This legend offered an explanation that at one time a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden Era]] had existed in England before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. From the Conquest on, the Diggers argued, the \"common people of England\" had been robbed of their birthrights and exploited by a foreign ruling-class.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Diggers advocated for an early form of public health insurance and communal ownership in opposition to individual ownership.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Peter Stearns |editor2=Cissie Fairchilds|editor3=Adele Lindenmeyr|editor4=Mary Jo Maynes|editor5=Roy Porter|editor6=Pamela radcliff|editor7=Guido Ruggiero|year=2001 |title=Encyclopedia of European Social History: From 1350 to 2000 - Volume 3 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=0-684-80577-4|pages=290}}</ref>\n\n==Practice==\n\n===St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey===\nThe Council of State received a letter in April 1649 reporting that several individuals had begun to plant vegetables in common land on [[St George's Hill]], [[Weybridge]] near [[Cobham, Surrey]] at a time when harvests were bad and food prices high.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The English Republic 1649-1660|last=Barnard|first=Toby|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Sanders reported that they had invited \"all to come in and help them, and promise them meat, drink, and clothes.\" They intended to pull down all [[enclosure]]s and cause the local populace to come and work with them. They claimed that their number would be several thousand within ten days. \"It is feared they have some design in hand.\" In the same month, the Diggers issued their most famous pamphlet and manifesto, called \"The True Levellers Standard Advanced\".<ref name=\"true_levellers\" />\n\nWhere exactly in St. George's Hill the Diggers were is a matter of dispute. Sanders alleges that they worked \"on that side of the hill next to Campe Close.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Winstanley and the Diggers, 1649-1999|last=Bradstock|first=Andrew|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> George Greenwood, however, speculated that the Diggers were \"somewhere near Silvermere Farm on the Byfleet Road rather than on the unprofitable slopes of St. George's Hill itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brave Community|last=Gurney|first=John|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=138}}</ref>\n\nAt the behest of the local landowners, the commander of the [[New Model Army]], Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], duly arrived with his troops and interviewed Winstanley and another prominent member of the Diggers, [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]]. Everard suspected that the Diggers were in serious trouble and soon left the group. Fairfax, meanwhile, having concluded that Diggers were doing no harm, advised the local landowners to use the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWinstanley remained and continued to write about the treatment they received. The harassment from the [[Lord of the Manor]], Francis Drake (not the famous [[Francis Drake]], who had died more than 50 years before), was both deliberate and systematic: he organised gangs in an attack on the Diggers, including numerous beatings and an arson attack on one of the communal houses. Following a court case, in which the Diggers were forbidden to speak in their own defence, they were found guilty of being [[Ranters]], a radical sect associated with liberal sexuality (though in fact [[Gerrard Winstanley|Winstanley]] had reprimanded Ranter [[Laurence Clarkson]] for his sexual practices).{{sfn|Laurence|1980|p=57}}{{sfn|Vann|1965|p=133}} If they had not left the land after losing the court case then the army could have been used to enforce the law and evict them; so they abandoned Saint George's Hill in August 1649, much to the relief of the local [[Fee simple|freeholders]].\n\n===Little Heath near Cobham===\nSome of the evicted Diggers moved a short distance to [[Little Heath, Surrey|Little Heath]] in Surrey. {{Convert|11|acre|ha|sigfig=2}} were cultivated, six houses built, winter crops harvested, and several pamphlets published. After initially expressing some sympathy for them, the local lord of the manor of [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], Parson [[John Platt (parson)|John Platt]], became their chief enemy. He used his power to stop local people helping them and he organised attacks on the Diggers and their property. By April 1650, Platt and other local landowners succeeded in driving the Diggers from Little Heath<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diggerstrail.org.uk/little-heath/|title=Little Heath - Surrey Diggers Trail|website=www.diggerstrail.org.uk|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Winstanley and the Diggers, 1649-199|last=Bradstock|first=Andrew|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\n\n===Wellingborough, Northamptonshire===\nThere was another community of Diggers close to [[Wellingborough]] in [[Northamptonshire]]. In 1650, the community published a declaration which started:\n:A Declaration of the Grounds and Reasons why we the Poor Inhabitants of the Town of Wellingborrow, in the County of Northampton, have begun and give consent to dig up, manure and sow Corn upon the Common, and waste ground, called Bareshanke belonging to the Inhabitants of Wellinborrow, by those that have Subscribed and hundreds more that give Consent....<ref name=\"declaration\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|title=A Declaration by the Diggers of Wellingborough \u2013 1650|website=www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis colony was probably founded as a result of contact with the Surrey Diggers. In late March 1650, four emissaries from the Surrey colony were arrested in Buckinghamshire bearing a letter signed by the Surrey Diggers including Gerrard Winstanley and Robert Coster inciting people to start Digger colonies and to provide money for the Surrey Diggers.

It also revealed that after the failure of the Surrey colony, the Diggers had left their children to be cared for by parish funds.\n\n==Influence==\n\nThe San Francisco Diggers were a radical community-action group of activists and Street Theatre actors operating from 1966 to 1968, based in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of [[San Francisco]].\n\nSince the revival of [[anarchism]] in the British [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|anti-roads movement]], the Diggers have been celebrated as precursors of land [[squatting]] and communalism. \nApril 1, 1999, on the 350th anniversary of the Diggers' occupation of the English Civil War on the same hill, [[The Land Is Ours]] organised a rally, then occupied land at [[St. George's Hill]] near [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]].\n\nIn 2011, an annual festival began in [[Wigan]] to celebrate the Diggers.

[[Gerrard Winstanley]]'s followers were known as ''True Levellers'' in 1649 and later became known as ''Diggers,'' because of their attempts to farm on common land.\n\nTheir original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].<ref>Acts 4:32, Today's English Version: \"The group of believers was one in mind and heart. No one said that any of his belongings was his own, but they all shared with one another everything they had.\"</ref><ref>\"[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/863 The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D]\" specifically mentions Acts 4.32</ref> The Diggers tried (by \"levelling\" [[land (economics)|land]]) to reform the existing [[social order]] with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small, [[egalitarian]] rural communities. They were one of a number of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] [[English Dissenters|dissenting groups]] that emerged around this time.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\nThe year 1649 was a time of great social unrest in England. The [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] had won the [[English Civil War#The First English Civil War|First English Civil War]] but failed to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the defeated King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. When members of Parliament and the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandees]] in the [[New Model Army]] were faced with Charles' perceived duplicity, they tried and executed him.\n\nGovernment through the King's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] was replaced with a new body called the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which due to fundamental disagreements within a weakened Parliament was dominated by the Army. Many people became active in politics, suggesting alternative forms of government to replace the old order.\n\nRoyalists wished to place King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] on the throne; men like [[Oliver Cromwell]] wished to govern with a [[plutocratic]] Parliament voted in by an electorate based on [[property]], similar to that which was enfranchised before the civil war; agitators called [[Levellers]], influenced by the writings of [[John Lilburne]], wanted parliamentary government based on an electorate of every male head of a household; [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] advocated a [[theocracy]]; and the Diggers, led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], advocated a more radical solution.\n\n==Theory==\nIn 1649 [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and 14 others published a pamphlet<ref name=\"true_levellers\">[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/863 ''The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men'']\n</ref> in which they called themselves the \"True Levellers\" to distinguish their ideas from those of the [[Levellers]]. Once they put their idea into practice and started to cultivate common land, both opponents and supporters began to call them \"Diggers\". The Diggers' beliefs were informed by Winstanley's writings which envisioned an ecological interrelationship between humans and nature, acknowledging the inherent connections between people and their surroundings.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Winstanley declared that \"true freedom lies where a man receives his nourishment and preservation, and that is in the use of the earth\".<ref>Grant, Neil. ''Hamlyn Children's History of Britain: From the Stone Age to the Present Day'', 2nd Rev edition (Dean, 1992), p.144</ref>\n\nAn undercurrent of political thought which has run through English society for many generations and resurfaced from time to time (for example, in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381) was present in some of the political factions of the 17th century, including those who formed the Diggers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It involved the common belief that England had become subjugated by the \"[[Norman Yoke]]\". This legend offered an explanation that at one time a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden Era]] had existed in England before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. From the Conquest on, the Diggers argued, the \"common people of England\" had been robbed of their birthrights and exploited by a foreign ruling-class.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Diggers advocated for an early form of public health insurance and communal ownership in opposition to individual ownership.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Peter Stearns |editor2=Cissie Fairchilds|editor3=Adele Lindenmeyr|editor4=Mary Jo Maynes|editor5=Roy Porter|editor6=Pamela radcliff|editor7=Guido Ruggiero|year=2001 |title=Encyclopedia of European Social History: From 1350 to 2000 - Volume 3 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=0-684-80577-4|pages=290}}</ref>\n\n==Practice==\n\n===St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey===\nThe Council of State received a letter in April 1649 reporting that several individuals had begun to plant vegetables in common land on [[St George's Hill]], [[Weybridge]] near [[Cobham, Surrey]] at a time when harvests were bad and food prices high.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The English Republic 1649-1660|last=Barnard|first=Toby|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Sanders reported that they had invited \"all to come in and help them, and promise them meat, drink, and clothes.\" They intended to pull down all [[enclosure]]s and cause the local populace to come and work with them. They claimed that their number would be several thousand within ten days. \"It is feared they have some design in hand.\" In the same month, the Diggers issued their most famous pamphlet and manifesto, called \"The True Levellers Standard Advanced\".<ref name=\"true_levellers\" />\n\nWhere exactly in St. George's Hill the Diggers were is a matter of dispute.

Everard suspected that the Diggers were in serious trouble and soon left the group. Fairfax, meanwhile, having concluded that Diggers were doing no harm, advised the local landowners to use the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWinstanley remained and continued to write about the treatment they received. The harassment from the [[Lord of the Manor]], Francis Drake (not the famous [[Francis Drake]], who had died more than 50 years before), was both deliberate and systematic: he organised gangs in an attack on the Diggers, including numerous beatings and an arson attack on one of the communal houses. Following a court case, in which the Diggers were forbidden to speak in their own defence, they were found guilty of being [[Ranters]], a radical sect associated with liberal sexuality (though in fact [[Gerrard Winstanley|Winstanley]] had reprimanded Ranter [[Laurence Clarkson]] for his sexual practices).{{sfn|Laurence|1980|p=57}}{{sfn|Vann|1965|p=133}} If they had not left the land after losing the court case then the army could have been used to enforce the law and evict them; so they abandoned Saint George's Hill in August 1649, much to the relief of the local [[Fee simple|freeholders]].\n\n===Little Heath near Cobham===\nSome of the evicted Diggers moved a short distance to [[Little Heath, Surrey|Little Heath]] in Surrey. {{Convert|11|acre|ha|sigfig=2}} were cultivated, six houses built, winter crops harvested, and several pamphlets published. After initially expressing some sympathy for them, the local lord of the manor of [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], Parson [[John Platt (parson)|John Platt]], became their chief enemy. He used his power to stop local people helping them and he organised attacks on the Diggers and their property. By April 1650, Platt and other local landowners succeeded in driving the Diggers from Little Heath<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diggerstrail.org.uk/little-heath/|title=Little Heath - Surrey Diggers Trail|website=www.diggerstrail.org.uk|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Winstanley and the Diggers, 1649-199|last=Bradstock|first=Andrew|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\n\n===Wellingborough, Northamptonshire===\nThere was another community of Diggers close to [[Wellingborough]] in [[Northamptonshire]].

In late March 1650, four emissaries from the Surrey colony were arrested in Buckinghamshire bearing a letter signed by the Surrey Diggers including Gerrard Winstanley and Robert Coster inciting people to start Digger colonies and to provide money for the Surrey Diggers.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]]. Pang was once a struggling student from Class VIII who is soon to be [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the Gifted Program through the school's Placement Exam. Through the Gifted Program, he discovers he has the power of [[Brainwashing|mind control]], in which he can compel someone do whatever he wishes through physical contact with the subject and feeling their [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. He becomes the Gifted Program's Head Student when Director Chueamanee removed Wave from the position after the class' midterm exams. He is close with fellow Gifted students Namtaan and Ohm.\n* [[Wachirawit Ruangwiwat]] as Wasuthorn \"Wave\" Worachotmethee\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Through the Program, Wave discovers his power of technopathy, the ability to control and manipulate electronic machines through contact, a gift associated with his advanced skills in [[mathematics]], [[Computer|computers]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Ms. Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Namtaan discovers her power of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], the ability to see or hear associated events on an object through contact, a gift associated on her character of being nosy. Namtaan has [[Essential hypertension|primary hypertension]] which limits her in using her psychometry in its full extent. She is close to Pang and Ohm.\n* Harit Cheewagaroon as Wichai \"Ohm\" Sai-Ngern\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Ohm has a form of [[psychokinesis]] which enables him to make objects (including humans) disappear and bringing them back again by will, which soon evolves to include [[invisibility]] and [[teleportation]] (of himself and other humans). This power is associated with his character of being forgetful and losing things most of the time. When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love. His passion for [[photography]] leads him to intimately associating with Koi who, unbeknowst to him, is acting upon orders from Mrs. Ladda to gather information about the Gifted Program.\n* Napasorn Weerayuttvilai as Patchamon \"Mon\" Pitiwongkorn\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Martial Arts Club. Mon possesses superhuman strength with enhanced agility, dexterity and coordination that is useful for combat. Her potential is associated with her passion for sports. However, her body produces [[pheromones]] that are excreted through her sweat and tears. Once exposed to it, a person would turn insane, violent and, worse, murderous.

Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

MS 19.2.1, currently forms part of the collection of the [[National Library of Scotland]]. It is an [[illuminated manuscript]] copied on [[parchment]] in the 14th century in London.  The manuscript provides a glimpse of a time of political tension and social change in England.  The English were continuing to reclaim their language and national identity, and to distance themselves from the [[Normans|Norman]] conquerors who had taken over the country after the [[Battle of Hastings]] 300 years before.\n\n==History of possession==\n[[Image:LordAuchinleck.jpg|thumb|150.px|Lord Auchinleck, who discovered the manuscript, and after whom it is named.]]\nThe manuscript is named after [[Alexander Boswell (judge)|Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck]], who was a lawyer and supreme court judge in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.  Lord Auchinleck lived from 1706 to 1782, and was the father of [[James Boswell]] who wrote The ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]''.  It is not known how Lord Auchinleck came to possess the manuscript, but it is believed he acquired it in 1740 and gave the book to the [[Advocates Library]] in Edinburgh in 1744.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/history.html \"History and Owners\"]}} It is a mystery who owned the book in the four hundred years from the time it was completed to when Lord Auchinleck first laid hands on it, but there are clues within.  On some of the pages are names that have been added in, which are presumed to be previous owners and their family members.  One of the [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the manuscript is a list of Norman aristocracy, now assumed to be a version of the [[Battle Abbey Roll]], and at the end of this list has been entered, in a different hand, the list of members from a family named Browne.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=107r Auchinleck MS f. 107rd]}} Also sprinkled throughout the text, others have entered their names individually for posterity, such as Christian Gunter{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=205r Auchinleck MS f. 205ra]}} and John Harreis.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=247r Auchinleck MS f. 247ra]}} These names have never been researched against church or town records.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/history.html \"History and Owners\"]}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Auchinleck MS f.34r.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from the manuscript.]]\nAuchinleck is believed to have been produced in London around 1340 by professional [[scribe]]s who were [[layman|laymen]], not by monks, as was more usually the case with medieval manuscript texts. There is debate among scholars of [[Middle English]], both as to how many scribes were involved in the production and writing-out of the text, and also as to whether they were merely copying the work from the original or [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplar]], or were at the same time translating the works from French or [[Latin]], rendering them incidentally into their own Middle English dialects.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=11}}  \n\nThrough the use of [[palaeography]] (the study of ancient handwriting), it has been determined that there had to be at least four, perhaps five, different scribes. Some scholars have argued that there were six scribes, yet most agree that the majority of the manuscript is in the hand of one man, who it is believed translated most of the literature.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=10}} With this knowledge, when one looks at the photographs of the manuscript found on the website of the [[National Library of Scotland]], it is easy to see the discrepancies in the actual handwriting of the scribes. Some is tight and regimented, attributed to Scribe 1, while some is more loosely written, as if the scribe did not make the correct adjustments for space and repeatedly ran out of room at the ends of the lines. While this has an entertaining visual effect when looking at the [[Folio (printing)|folio]]s, or pages, its historical importance lies in the clues that it gives to the process of book production for private clients in a secular scriptorium at an early period in the emergence of that industry.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=76}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Auchinleck, in its present state, consists of forty-three pieces of literature.  All of these works are in [[Middle English]] but the language used has been determined to be several differing dialects that would have been used in different parts of England.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=265}} These dialects further serve to determine the origins of the scribes, such as London as opposed to south-west [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as they would have written the language in the manner they spoke as well as the spelling they were taught, which furthers the question of translation.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}\n\nSince the language is consistent within each text, it is surmised the scribes worked independently on each whole story as opposed to the manner more commonly used in monasteries in which the monks would copy text directly from the exemplars, only one page at a time, with a [[catchword]] inscribed at the bottom corner for later collation. Although there are catchwords in the manuscript, each scribe would have been responsible for all of the pages of each of his assignments. This newer method of production suggests that one production manager was responsible for contracting the work, gave each scribe assignments that included whole stories, while overseeing the project, and being the contact person to the client if the book was indeed [[bespoke]], or special order.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}\n\nAlso of significance is that the Auchinleck manuscript is the first known anthology of English literature, particularly the largest collection of English romances up until that time.  Previously the use of Latin or French had been almost exclusive in books, but English was beginning to be an acceptable language for [[pamphlet]]s and literature.{{sfn|Loomis|1962|p=15}} It was during this time that the English were beginning to shift away from French and to form a separate identity, socially and politically, so it would follow that the use of \"Inglisch\", as it is referred to in the manuscript, in the written word would be a source of national unification.{{sfn|Calkin|2005|p=8}}\n\n==Illumination==\n[[Image:NLS Adv MS 19.2.1 Auchinleck Manuscript 176r.jpg|thumb|200px]]\nThe Auchinleck manuscript was [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]], although not as ornately as the religious books of the era, such as [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Unfortunately, many of the miniatures in the manuscript have been lost to thieves or people peddling the images for profit. The four remaining miniatures and the [[Historiated initial|historiated]] letters suggest it was beautifully, yet modestly, decorated at one time. It has been determined through comparing artistic styles that the illustration was done by a handful of artists who illuminated other manuscripts commercially produced in the London area. This points to a group of illuminators, who it is believed collaborated on other works that have been preserved from the Middle Ages, who have been studied independently, and whose work is now being seen in a new light as a collective community.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=80}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is not well known outside of scholarly circles, yet it is one of the most important English documents surviving from the Middle Ages. Within its folios, it tracks not only the literature of the period, reflecting the tastes of readers in [[Chaucer]]'s time and how its subjects were increasingly diverging from religious topics, but also the development of a language as part of a national self-image.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=x}} It speaks to us of the independence of spirit with which the English people wanted to identify themselves as separate from their French cousins by claiming their own language in a fundamental expression, in their literature.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed, there are multiple interpretations of the Auchinleck MSS and this is but one of them|date=March 2013}} As such, the manuscript is important in scholarship of the medieval romances, of London codicology (manuscript studies), of dialect and linguistic studies, and for the possibility (though unproven) that Chaucer himself may have had personal use of Auchinleck, based on claimed correspondences to his writings.\n\n==Contents==\n[[Image:NLS Adv MS 19.2.1 Auchinleck Manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of the narrative about king Richard.]]\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is a [[codex]] of medieval narratives ranging from Saints' [[vitae]] to [[conversion tale]]s.

One of the [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the manuscript is a list of Norman aristocracy, now assumed to be a version of the [[Battle Abbey Roll]], and at the end of this list has been entered, in a different hand, the list of members from a family named Browne.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=107r Auchinleck MS f. 107rd]}} Also sprinkled throughout the text, others have entered their names individually for posterity, such as Christian Gunter{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=205r Auchinleck MS f. 205ra]}} and John Harreis.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=247r Auchinleck MS f. 247ra]}} These names have never been researched against church or town records.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/history.html \"History and Owners\"]}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Auchinleck MS f.34r.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from the manuscript.]]\nAuchinleck is believed to have been produced in London around 1340, by professional [[scribe]]s, who were [[layman|laymen]], not monks as was usually the case. The number of scribes involved in the production is a source of debate with scholars of [[Middle English]]. The controversy involves not only the number of scribes who actually wrote the text out, but if they, in fact, only copied the work from the [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplar]], the original, or translated the works from French or [[Latin]], inadvertently into their own Middle English dialects.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=11}}\n\nThrough the use of [[palaeography]], or the study of ancient handwriting, it has been determined that there had to be at least four, perhaps five, different scribes.  Some scholars have argued that there were six scribes, yet most agree that the majority of the manuscript is in the hand of one man, who it is believed translated most of the literature.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=10}} With this knowledge, when one looks at the photographs of the manuscript found on the website of the [[National Library of Scotland]], it is easy to see the discrepancies in the actual handwriting of the scribes.  Some is tight and regimented, attributed to Scribe 1, while some more loose, as if the scribe did not make the correct adjustments for space and repeatedly ran out of room at the ends of the lines.  While this makes for fun visual entertainment when looking at the [[Folio (printing)|folio]]s, or pages, the historical importance is that it gives clues into how the book might have been produced in a time when the commerce of making books for private clients in a secular bookshop began to flourish.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=76}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Auchinleck, in its present state, consists of forty-three pieces of literature.  All of these works are in [[Middle English]] but the language used has been determined to be several differing dialects that would have been used in different parts of England.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=265}} These dialects further serve to determine the origins of the scribes, such as London as opposed to south-west [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as they would have written the language in the manner they spoke as well as the spelling they were taught, which furthers the question of translation.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}\n\nSince the language is consistent within each text, it is surmised the scribes worked independently on each whole story as opposed to the manner more commonly used in monasteries in which the monks would copy text directly from the exemplars, only one page at a time, with a [[catchword]] inscribed at the bottom corner for later collation. Although there are catchwords in the manuscript, each scribe would have been responsible for all of the pages of each of his assignments. This newer method of production suggests that one production manager was responsible for contracting the work, gave each scribe assignments that included whole stories, while overseeing the project, and being the contact person to the client if the book was indeed [[bespoke]], or special order.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}\n\nAlso of significance is that the Auchinleck manuscript is the first known anthology of English literature, particularly the largest collection of English romances up until that time.  Previously the use of Latin or French had been almost exclusive in books, but English was beginning to be an acceptable language for [[pamphlet]]s and literature.{{sfn|Loomis|1962|p=15}} It was during this time that the English were beginning to shift away from French and to form a separate identity, socially and politically, so it would follow that the use of \"Inglisch\", as it is referred to in the manuscript, in the written word would be a source of national unification.{{sfn|Calkin|2005|p=8}}\n\n==Illumination==\n[[Image:NLS Adv MS 19.2.1 Auchinleck Manuscript 176r.jpg|thumb|200px]]\nThe Auchinleck manuscript was [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]], although not as ornately as the religious books of the era, such as [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Unfortunately, many of the miniatures in the manuscript have been lost to thieves or people peddling the images for profit. The four remaining miniatures and the [[Historiated initial|historiated]] letters suggest it was beautifully, yet modestly, decorated at one time. It has been determined through comparing artistic styles that the illustration was done by a handful of artists who illuminated other manuscripts commercially produced in the London area. This points to a group of illuminators, who it is believed collaborated on other works that have been preserved from the Middle Ages, who have been studied independently, and whose work is now being seen in a new light as a collective community.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=80}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is not well known outside of scholarly circles, yet it is one of the most important English documents surviving from the Middle Ages. Within its folios, it tracks not only the literature of the period, reflecting the tastes of readers in [[Chaucer]]'s time and how its subjects were increasingly diverging from religious topics, but also the development of a language as part of a national self-image.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=x}} It speaks to us of the independence of spirit with which the English people wanted to identify themselves as separate from their French cousins by claiming their own language in a fundamental expression, in their literature.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed, there are multiple interpretations of the Auchinleck MSS and this is but one of them|date=March 2013}} As such, the manuscript is important in scholarship of the medieval romances, of London codicology (manuscript studies), of dialect and linguistic studies, and for the possibility (though unproven) that Chaucer himself may have had personal use of Auchinleck, based on claimed correspondences to his writings.\n\n==Contents==\n[[Image:NLS Adv MS 19.2.1 Auchinleck Manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of the narrative about king Richard.]]\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is a [[codex]] of medieval narratives ranging from Saints' [[vitae]] to [[conversion tale]]s.

{"title_page": "Melita issue", "text_new": "[[File:Malta 1922 One Pound.jpg|thumb|The \u00a31 black and carmine, the highest denomination of the Melita issue]]\n\nThe '''Melita issue''' is a series of dual-purpose [[Postage stamp|postage]]-and-[[Revenue stamp|revenue stamps]] issued by the [[Crown Colony of Malta]] between 1922 and 1926, depicting the national personification [[Melita (personification)|Melita]]. They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481. The figure of [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] seems to have developed from allegorical representations of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John]], which [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|ruled Malta]] between 1530 and 1798.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kinnane-Roelofsma |first1=Derk |title=Britannia and Melita: Pseudomorphic Sisters |journal=Journal of the Warbourg and Courtauld Insitute |date=1996 |volume=59 |pages=130\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nMelita first appeared on stamps in 1899. A 2[[shilling|s]]/6d olive-grey stamp depicted her holding a sword and a shield, the latter emblazoned with the [[Maltese cross]].

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible. Shields depicting the [[Union Jack]] and a colonial badge representing Malta are located at the bottom of the design.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nVella's design contains two figures representing Malta and the United Kingdom, Melita and [[Brittania]]. Melita holds an olive branch in her hand, and embraces Brittania by lifting her hand around Brittania's neck. Brittania wears a helmet and holds a shield with the Union Jack.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]]. Specimens of all the stamps in the issued colours also exist, except for the reprints made in slightly different shades, the 1925 2\u00bdd on 3d surcharge, and the 1926 postage overprints.<ref name=\"trory\"/>\n\n==Issued stamps==\n[[File:Stamp Malta 1924 1p.jpg|thumb|The 1d bright violet issued on 25 April 1924]]\n\nThe first Melita stamps were issued on 1 August 1922, with the denominations of \u00bdd, 1d, 6d, 1/- and 2/-.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist.
