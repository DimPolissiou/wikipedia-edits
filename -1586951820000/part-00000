The upper floors house the museum]]\n\n'''Handel & Hendrix in London''' (previously '''Handel House Museum''') is a museum in [[Mayfair]], London, dedicated to the lives and works of the German-born British baroque composer [[George Frideric Handel]] and the American rock singer-guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]], who lived at 25 and 23 Brook Street respectively.\n\nHandel made his home in London in 1712 and eventually became a British citizen in 1727. Handel was the first occupant of 25 [[Brook Street]], which he rented from 1723 until his death there in 1759.  Almost all his works after 1723, amongst them many of his best-known operas, oratorios and ceremonial music, were composed and partially rehearsed in the house, which contained a variety of keyboard instruments, including [[harpsichord]]s, a [[clavichord]] and a small [[chamber organ]].\n\nThe museum was opened in 2001 by the Handel House Trust as the result of an initiative of the musicologist and Handelian [[Stanley Sadie]] in 1959. It comprises a carefully restored set of period rooms on the first and second floors of 25 Brook Street together with exhibition rooms in number 23, the adjacent house on the terrace. In 2016 the museum expanded to incorporate the upper floors of 23 Brook Street, home of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s.\n\n==The museum==\n\nThe original idea for establishing a museum at 25 Brook Street to commemorate its original and most notable occupant first occurred to the musicologist [[Stanley Sadie]] in 1959, at a party held there by the fashion company [[Viyella]] to commemorate the bicentenary of Handel's death. After a further 30 years, in the early 1990s Sadie and his wife Julie Anne set up the Handel House Trust, the charity which oversaw the conversion of the house into a museum.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|2001}}</ref>\n\nThe house has been restored to look as it did during Handel's 36 year occupancy from 1723 to 1759. A typical early 18th century London terrace house, it comprises a basement, three main storeys and an attic, and Handel was the first occupant. The attic was later converted into a fourth full floor. The ground floor is a shop not associated with the Museum, and the upper floors are leased to a charity called the Handel House Trust, and have been open to the public since 8 November 2001.\n\nThe interiors have been restored to the somewhat spartan style of the Georgian era, using mostly architectural elements from elsewhere, since, apart from the staircase, few of the original interior features survived.\n\nThe Handel House Collection Trust has assembled a collection of Handel memorabilia, including the Byrne Collection of several hundred items, which was acquired in 1998.\n\n==History==\n\nHandel acquired 25 Brook Street in the summer of 1723, shortly after having been appointed by [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] as composer to the [[Chapel Royal]], for which he was paid \u00a3400 per annum. The house had been newly built with Nos. 23, 27/29 and 31 by George Barnes as part of the planned extension of Brook Street, linking [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] with [[Grosvenor Square]], between 1717 and 1726. Originally, as a foreign national, Handel was not eligible to buy or take long-term leases on property in London; and even when he acquired British nationality in 1727, Handel continued renting the property on short-term leases. The fact that he remained there for the rest of his life, almost 40 years, is remarkable, since opera composers at the time were [[no fixed abode|rarely of fixed abode]]; prior to that, Handel had been lodged in the homes of friends and patrons.

The upper floors house the museum]]\n\n'''Handel & Hendrix in London''' (previously '''Handel House Museum''') is a museum in [[Mayfair]], London dedicated to the lives and works of the German-born British baroque composer [[George Frideric Handel]] and the American rock singer-guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]], who lived at 25 and 23 Brook Street respectively.\n\nHandel made his home in London in 1712 and eventually became a British citizen in 1727. Handel was the first occupant of 25 [[Brook Street]], which he rented from 1723 until his death there in 1759.  Almost all his works after 1723, amongst them many of his best-known operas, oratorios and ceremonial music, were composed and partially rehearsed in the house, which contained a variety of keyboard instruments, including [[harpsichord]]s, a [[clavichord]] and a small [[chamber organ]].\n\nThe museum was opened in 2001 by the Handel House Trust as the result of an initiative of the musicologist and Handelian [[Stanley Sadie]] in 1959. It comprises a carefully restored set of period rooms on the first and second floors of 25 Brook Street together with exhibition rooms in number 23, the adjacent house on the terrace. In 2016 the museum expanded to incorporate the upper floors of 23 Brook Street, home of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s.\n\n==The museum==\n\nThe original idea for establishing a museum at 25 Brook Street to commemorate its original and most notable occupant first occurred to the musicologist [[Stanley Sadie]] in 1959, at a party held there by the fashion company [[Viyella]] to commemorate the bicentenary of Handel's death. After a further 30 years, in the early 1990s Sadie and his wife Julie Anne set up the Handel House Trust, the charity which oversaw the conversion of the house into a museum.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|2001}}</ref>\n\nThe house has been restored to look as it did during Handel's 36 year occupancy from 1723 to 1759. A typical early 18th century London terrace house, it comprises a basement, three main storeys and an attic, and Handel was the first occupant. The attic was later converted into a fourth full floor. The ground floor is a shop not associated with the Museum, and the upper floors are leased to a charity called the Handel House Trust, and have been open to the public since 8 November 2001.\n\nThe interiors have been restored to the somewhat spartan style of the Georgian era, using mostly architectural elements from elsewhere, since, apart from the staircase, few of the original interior features survived.\n\nThe Handel House Collection Trust has assembled a collection of Handel memorabilia, including the Byrne Collection of several hundred items, which was acquired in 1998.\n\n==History==\n\nHandel acquired 25 Brook Street in the summer of 1723, shortly after having been appointed by [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] as composer to the [[Chapel Royal]], for which he was paid \u00a3400 per annum. The house had been newly built with Nos. 23, 27/29 and 31 by George Barnes as part of the planned extension of Brook Street, linking [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] with [[Grosvenor Square]], between 1717 and 1726. Originally, as a foreign national, Handel was not eligible to buy or take long term leases on property in London; and even when he acquired British nationality in 1727, Handel continued renting the property on short term leases. The fact that he remained there for the rest of his life, almost 40 years, is remarkable, since opera composers at the time were [[no fixed abode|rarely of fixed abode]]; prior to that, Handel had been lodged in the homes of friends and patrons. At the age of 38, Handel had become accepted within the higher echelons of British society, with whom he freely mixed. His immediate neighbours on either side were from the upper middle classes and initially included the [[Member of Parliament]], [[John Monckton, 1st Viscount Galway|John Monckton]], who later became the first [[Viscount Galway]] in 1727.{{sfn|Riding|Burrows|Hicks|2001|pp=7,23}}\nThe layout of the rooms followed the conventions for a modest [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] townhouse: the basement contained the kitchens; on each of the three floors above, there was a front room and a smaller back room with an adjacent closet; under the roof were [[garret]]s for servants.<ref name=\"RBH\">\n{{harvnb|Riding|Burrows|Hicks|2001}}</ref>\n\nThe larger front first room was used for rehearsal and probably contained a [[harpsichord]] and a small house [[chamber organ]].

Although it is more expensive, it generally results in a higher-quality product.\n\n# The coffee extract is rapidly frozen and is broken into small granules. (Slower freezing would lead to larger ice crystals and a porous product; it can also affect the colour of the coffee granules).\n# The granules are sifted and sorted on size.<ref name=\"MussattoMachado2011\"/>\n# Frozen coffee granules are placed in the drying chamber, often on metal trays.\n# A vacuum is created within the chamber. The strength of the vacuum is critical in the speed of the drying and therefore the quality of the product. Care must be taken to produce a vacuum of suitable strength.\n# The drying chamber is warmed, most commonly by [[thermal radiation|radiation]], but [[heat conduction|conduction]] is used in some plants and [[convection]] has been proposed in some small pilot plants. A possible problem with convection is uneven drying rates within the chamber, which would give an inferior product.\n# Condensation\u2014the previously frozen water in the coffee granules expands to ten times its previous volume. The removal of this water vapor from the chamber is vitally important, making the condenser the most critical and expensive component in a freeze-drying plant.\n# The freeze-dried granules are removed from the chamber and packaged.\n\n===Spray drying===\n{{main|Spray drying}}\n[[Image:Labspraydryer.svg|thumb|Laboratory-scale spray dryer.<br /> A=Solution or suspension to be dried in, B=Atomization gas in, 1= Drying gas in, 2=Heating of drying gas, 3=Spraying of solution or suspension, 4=Drying chamber, 5=Part between drying chamber and cyclone, 6=Cyclone, 7=Drying gas is taken away, 8=Collection vessel of product, arrows mean that this is co-current lab-spraydryer]]\n\nSpray drying is preferred to freeze-drying in some cases because it allows larger scale economic production, shorter drying times, and because it produces fine rounded particles.\n\nThe process produces spherical particles about {{convert|300|\u00b5m}} in size with a density of 0.22 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite book | title = Spray Drying Handbook | edition = 5th | first = K | last = Masters | year = 1991 | publisher = Longman Scientific & Technical | isbn = 978-0-582-06266-5 }}</ref> To achieve this, nozzle atomization is used.

Although it is more expensive, it generally results in a higher-quality product.\n\n# The coffee extract is rapidly frozen and is broken into small granules. (Slower freezing would lead to larger ice crystals and a porous product; it can also affect the colour of the coffee granules).\n# The granules are sifted and sorted on size.<ref name=\"MussattoMachado2011\"/>\n# Frozen coffee granules are placed in the drying chamber, often on metal trays.\n# A vacuum is created within the chamber. The strength of the vacuum is critical in the speed of the drying and therefore the quality of the product. Care must be taken to produce a vacuum of suitable strength.\n# The drying chamber is warmed, most commonly by [[thermal radiation|radiation]], but [[heat conduction|conduction]] is used in some plants and [[convection]] has been proposed in some small pilot plants. A possible problem with convection is uneven drying rates within the chamber, which would give an inferior product.\n# Condensation\u2014the previously frozen water in the coffee granules expands to ten times its previous volume. The removal of this water vapor from the chamber is vitally important, making the condenser the most critical and expensive component in a freeze-drying plant.\n# The freeze-dried granules are removed from the chamber and packaged.\n\n===Spray drying===\n{{main|Spray drying}}\n[[Image:Labspraydryer.svg|thumb|Laboratory-scale spray dryer.<br /> A=Solution or suspension to be dried in, B=Atomization gas in, 1= Drying gas in, 2=Heating of drying gas, 3=Spraying of solution or suspension, 4=Drying chamber, 5=Part between drying chamber and cyclone, 6=Cyclone, 7=Drying gas is taken away, 8=Collection vessel of product, arrows mean that this is co-current lab-spraydryer]]\n\nSpray drying is preferred to freeze-drying in some cases because it allows larger scale economic production, shorter drying times, and because it produces fine rounded particles.\n\nThe process produces spherical particles about {{convert|300|\u00b5m}} in size with a density of 0.22 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite book | title = Spray Drying Handbook | edition = 5th | first = K | last = Masters | year = 1991 | publisher = Longman Scientific & Technical | isbn = 978-0-582-06266-5 }}</ref> To achieve this, nozzle atomization is used.
