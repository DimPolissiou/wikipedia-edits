{"title_page": "Abdominal surgery", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2013}}\nThe term '''abdominal surgery''' broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the [[abdomen]] ([[laparotomy]]).  Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).\n\n== Types ==\nThe most common abdominal surgeries are described below.\n\n*[[Appendectomy]]\u2014Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure.\n*[[Caesarean section]] (also known as C-section) is a surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies, or, rarely, to remove a dead fetus.\n*[[Inguinal hernia surgery]]\u2014This refers to the repair of an [[inguinal hernia]].\n*Exploratory [[laparotomy]]\u2014This refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem.\n*[[Laparoscopy]]\u2014A [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy ([[gallbladder]] removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional \"open\" method.\n\n== Complications ==\nComplications of abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to:\n* [[Adhesion (medicine)|Adhesions]] (also called scar tissue): Complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent, they have a large negative effect on patients\u2019 health, and increase workload in clinical practice<ref name=Broek>{{cite journal |vauthors =Broek R, Issa Y, Van Santbrink E, Bouvy N |title=Burden of adhesions in abdominal and pelvic surgery: systematic review and met-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=347 |issue= |pages=f5588 |year=2013 |pmid= 24092941|pmc=3789584 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f5588 |display-authors=etal|hdl=2066/125383}}</ref> \n* [[Hemorrhage|Bleeding]]\n* [[Infection]]\n* [[Paralytic ileus]] (sometimes called [[ileus]]): short-term paralysis of the bowel\n* [[Perioperative mortality]] (death)\n* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n\nSterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], use of the [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]], and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.\n\nGlobally, there are few studies comparing [[perioperative mortality]] following abdominal surgery across different health systems.

Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).\n\n== Types ==\nThe most common abdominal surgeries are described below.\n\n*[[Appendectomy]]\u2014Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure.\n*[[Caesarean section]] (also known as C-section) is a surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies, or, rarely, to remove a dead fetus.\n*[[Inguinal hernia surgery]]\u2014This refers to the repair of an [[inguinal hernia]].\n*Exploratory [[laparotomy]]\u2014This refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem.\n*[[Laparoscopy]]\u2014A [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy ([[gallbladder]] removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional \"open\" method.\n\n== Complications ==\nComplications of abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to:\n* [[Adhesion (medicine)|Adhesions]] (also called scar tissue): Complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent, they have a large negative effect on patients\u2019 health, and increase workload in clinical practice<ref name=Broek>{{cite journal |vauthors =Broek R, Issa Y, Van Santbrink E, Bouvy N |title=Burden of adhesions in abdominal and pelvic surgery: systematic review and met-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=347 |issue= |pages=f5588 |year=2013 |pmid= 24092941|pmc=3789584 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f5588 |display-authors=etal|hdl=2066/125383}}</ref> \n* [[Hemorrhage|Bleeding]]\n* [[Infection]]\n* [[Paralytic ileus]] (sometimes called [[ileus]]): short-term paralysis of the bowel\n* [[Perioperative mortality]] (death)\n* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n\nSterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], use of the [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]], and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.\n\nGlobally, there are few studies comparing [[perioperative mortality]] following abdominal surgery across different health systems. One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency [[laparotomy]] from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors.<ref name=GlobalSurg2016>{{Cite journal|vauthors=((GlobalSurg Collaborative))|title=Mortality of emergency abdominal surgery in high-, middle- and low-income countries|journal=British Journal of Surgery|volume=103|issue=8|pages=971\u2013988|year=2016|pmid=27145169|doi=10.1002/bjs.10151|hdl=20.500.11820/7c4589f5-7845-4405-a384-dfb5653e2163}}</ref> In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1\u00b76 per cent at 24\u2009hours (high 1\u00b71 per cent, middle 1\u00b79 per cent, low 3\u00b74 per cent; P < 0\u00b7001), increasing to 5\u00b74 per cent by 30 days (high 4\u00b75 per cent, middle 6\u00b70 per cent, low 8\u00b76 per cent; P < 0\u00b7001).

It was written by both alongside [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Max Martin]], being produced by the latter two with [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with [[Carolina Liar|Peter Carlsson]] serving as a vocal producer. The song was released by [[Republic Records]] on April 28, 2014, as the [[lead single]] from Grande's second studio album ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014). \"Problem\" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song with influences of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music, which comprises a melody based on [[drums]], [[saxophone]] loops, and [[trumpets]]. The chorus features uncredited background vocals from American hip hop artist [[Big Sean]]. Lyrically, Grande has stated that the song is about \"the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour \u2013 but you want to more than anything.\"\n\nThe song debuted at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] selling 438,000 copies in its first week on sale, earning Grande her biggest digital song sales week ever. The song later peaked at number two, surpassing \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\" as her highest-charting single in the United States at the time. It also became Azalea's second-highest charting single in the US, after her own single \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\". \"Problem\" remained in the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first sixteen weeks of its chart run, making its number three debut on May 7, 2014 and dropping out of the top ten on August 27, 2014. It topped the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts.

It was written by both alongside [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Max Martin]], being produced by the latter two with [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with [[Carolina Liar|Peter Carlsson]] serving as a vocal producer. The song was released by [[Republic Records]] on April 28, 2014, as the [[lead single]] from Grande's second studio album ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014). \"Problem\" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song with influences of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music, which comprises a melody based on [[drums]], [[saxophone]] loops, and [[trumpets]]. The chorus features uncredited background vocals from American hip hop artist [[Big Sean]]. Lyrically, Grande has stated that the song is about \"the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour \u2013 but you want to more than anything.\"\n\nThe song debuted at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] selling 438,000 copies in its first week on sale, earning Grande her biggest digital song sales week ever. The song later peaked at number two, surpassing \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\" as her highest-charting single in the United States at the time. It also became Azalea's second-highest charting single in the US, after her own single \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\". \"Problem\" remained in the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first sixteen weeks of its chart run, making its number three debut on May 7, 2014 and dropping out of the top ten on August 27, 2014. It topped the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts. Internationally, the single debuted at the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top ten of the charts in most other territories, including Australia, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece. \"Problem\" became the first song to top the UK Singles chart based on both sales and streaming.\n\nTo promote the song, Grande performed it first at the [[2014 Radio Disney Music Awards]], followed by the [[2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards]], on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and at the [[2014 Billboard Music Awards]]. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Nev Todorovic and premiered on [[Vevo]] on May 30, 2014. It won \"Best Pop Video\" at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] and has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times.
