He received the kingdom of Austrasia plus the cities (''civitates'') of [[Poitiers]], [[Tours]], [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], [[Bordeaux]], and [[Ch\u00e2teaudun]], as well as the [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]], the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and [[Alamannia|Transjurane Alemannia]].\n\nDuring his early years, his grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhilda]] ruled for Theudebert and his brother [[Theuderic II]], who had received the realm of Burgundy.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\". Rhoads was inspired and chose this as the name of his band.<ref>Randy Rhoads: A Life, by David A. Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]]. Osbourne has stated in the ensuing years that he was immediately blown away by the guitarist's talent and hired him immediately.<ref name=\"I Am Ozzy\">{{cite book|last1=Osbourne|first1=Ozzy|title=I Am Ozzy|date=2009|publisher=Hachette Book Group, Inc.|location=237 Park Avenue New York, NY 10017|isbn=978-0-446-57313-9|page=100|edition=Jan 2010 eBook|url=http://www.125books.com/inc/pt4321/pt4322/pt4323/pt4324/pt4325/data_all%20books/x/x%20%20Osbourne%20%20Ozz%20I%20Am%20Ozzy%20kindle%20books.pdf|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, bassist Rudy Sarzo followed Rhoads to Osbourne's band and Quiet Riot's future seemed very much in doubt. As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest. Following the demise of Quiet Riot, Dubrow recruited former [[Gamma (band)|Gamma]] drummer Skip Gillette and played shows in the L.A club circuit for approximately two years under the band name DuBrow.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Rebirth and ''Metal Health'' success (1982\u20131984)===\nIn early 1982, having recruited drummer [[Frankie Banali]], bassist [[Chuck Wright]], and guitarist [[Carlos Cavazo]], DuBrow contacted Rhoads to ask if he had any objections to him reviving the name Quiet Riot for his new band. Rhoads gave him his blessing but said he wanted to check with Rudy Sarzo first. Sarzo had no objections, and Quiet Riot was thus reborn after a two-year hiatus.<ref name=\"SarzoMemoir\">Sarzo, Rudy (2017). Off the Rails (third edition). CreateSpace Publishing. {{ISBN|1-53743-746-1}}</ref> Rhoads died suddenly in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in March 1982, and Sarzo subsequently left Osbourne's band a few months later, having a difficult time coping with the grief of losing his close friend and bandmate.<ref name=\"SarzoMemoir\" /> The reformed Quiet Riot was recording a new song called \"Thunderbird\" as a tribute to Rhoads, and DuBrow called Sarzo to ask if he'd like to participate in the recording. The lineup of DuBrow, Sarzo, Cavazo, and Banali had so much fun recording the track that they wound up recording more than half of the new album in the process.<ref name=\"juke/ref\"/> Bassist Wright had already been briefly replaced by Gary Van Dyke (Hollywood Stars, Virgin), but the arrangement wasn't working out and Sarzo was subsequently welcomed back to Quiet Riot as a full time member.<ref name=\"juke/ref\" /> Coming so soon after Rhoads' death, there was some question over the appropriateness of the new band using the Quiet Riot name. Rhoads' mother Delores encouraged the band,<ref name=\"SarzoMemoir\" /> and in the end it was decided that \"although Randy wouldn't be in it, the original spirit of the band was back,\" according to Sarzo.<ref name=\"juke/ref\" />\n\nIn September 1982, with help from producer [[Pasha Records|Spencer Proffer]], Quiet Riot finally signed a US recording contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] and the album ''[[Metal Health]]'' was released on March 11, 1983. The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States.

At one point he even compared his band to [[The Beatles]]. DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief.

That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot. Kevin DuBrow subsequently fought in court to keep control of the band's name.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Reformation and ''Metal Health'' lineup reunion (1990\u20132003)===\nHaving won the rights to the band's name, DuBrow teamed up with 21-year-old English born blues guitarist Sean Manning, bassist Kenny Hillery, and drummer Pat Ashby to reform Quiet Riot. Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''.

This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996. ''Greatest Hits'' covered only material from the CBS years, including three tracks from the 1988 album with Shortino and two previously promo-only live tracks.

I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\".

Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]].

As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest.

Rhoads gave him his blessing but said he wanted to check with Rudy Sarzo first.

The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No.&nbsp;1 album in the same week.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their success was aided in no small part by the \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" video's heavy rotation on MTV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''Metal Health'' displaced [[The Police]]'s ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' at No.&nbsp;1 and stayed there for just a week until [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' took over the No.&nbsp;1 spot.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Metal Health'''s title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;31.

DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief.

That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot.

Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''. The band played venues throughout the United States until 1990 when Manning left to join the band [[Hurricane (American band)|Hurricane]].{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nBy the early 1990s tempers had cooled between former bandmates Carlos Cavazo and Kevin DuBrow, and they started to communicate again. They eventually formed the band Heat in 1991 with bassist Kenny Hillery and drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]]. This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996.

I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace.

{"title_page": "Distributive property", "text_new": "{{redirect distinguish|Distributivity|Distributivism}}\n[[File:Illustration of distributive property with rectangles.svg|thumb|Visualization of distributive law for positive numbers]]\nIn [[abstract algebra]] and [[formal logic]], the '''distributive property''' of [[binary operation]]s generalizes the '''distributive law''' from [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] and [[elementary algebra]]. In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''distribution''' refers to two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to reformulate [[logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] within [[formal proof|logical proofs]]...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in [[arithmetic]]:\n: 2 \u22c5 (1 + 3) = (2 \u22c5 1) + (2 \u22c5 3), but 2 / (1 + 3) \u2260 (2 / 1) + (2 / 3).\n\nOn the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and 3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the products added afterward.\nBecause these give the same final answer (8),  multiplication by 2 is said to ''distribute'' over the addition of 1 and 3.\nSince one could have put any [[real number]]s in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained a true equation, [[multiplication]] of real numbers ''distributes'' over [[addition]] of real numbers.\n\n==Definition==\n\nGiven a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} and two [[binary operator]]s \u2217 and + on {{math|''S''}}, the operation * :\n\nis ''left-distributive'' over + if, [[given any]] elements {{math|''x'', ''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} of {{math|''S''}},\n:<math>x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z),</math>\n\nis ''right-distributive'' over + if, given any elements {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} of {{math|''S''}},\n:<math>(y + z) * x = (y * x) + (z * x),</math> and\n\nis ''distributive'' over + if it is left- and right-distributive.<ref>[http://mathonline.wikidot.com/distributivity-of-binary-operations Distributivity of Binary Operations] from Mathonline</ref>\n\nNotice that when \u2217 is [[commutative]], the three conditions above are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].\n\n==Meaning==\nThe operators used for examples in this section are the [[binary operation]]s of [[addition]] (<math>+</math>) and [[multiplication]] (<math>\\cdot</math>) of [[number]]s.\n\nThere is a distinction between left-distributivity and right-distributivity:\n\n:<math>a \\cdot \\left( b \\pm c \\right) = a \\cdot b \\pm a \\cdot c</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;(left-distributive)\n:<math>(a \\pm b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot c \\pm b \\cdot c</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;(right-distributive)\n\nIn either case, the distributive property can be described in words as:\n\nTo multiply a [[summation|sum]] (or [[difference (mathematics)|difference]]) by a factor, each summand (or [[minuend]] and [[subtrahend]]) is multiplied by this factor and the resulting products are added (or subtracted).\n\nIf the operation outside the parentheses (in this case, the multiplication) is commutative, then left-distributivity implies right-distributivity  and vice versa.\n\nOne example of an operation that is \"only\" right-distributive is division, which is not commutative:\n\n:<math>(a \\pm b) \\div c = a \\div c \\pm b \\div c</math> \nIn this case, left-distributivity does not apply:\n\n:<math>a \\div(b \\pm c) \\neq a \\div b \\pm a \\div c</math>\n\nThe distributive laws are among the axioms for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] (like the ring of [[integer]]s) and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] (like the field of [[rational number]]s). Here multiplication is distributive over addition, but addition is not distributive over multiplication. Examples of structures in which two operations are mutually related to each other by the distributive law (e.&nbsp;g., they distribute over each other) are [[Boolean algebras]] such as the [[algebra of sets]] or the [[switching algebra]].\n\nMultiplying sums can be put into words as follows: When a sum is multiplied by a sum, multiply each summand of a sum with each summand of the other sum (keeping track of signs) then add up all of the resulting products.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Real numbers===\nIn the following examples, the use of the distributive law on the set of real numbers <math>\\R</math> is illustrated. When multiplication is mentioned in elementary mathematics, it usually refers to this kind of multiplication. From the point of view of algebra, the real numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which ensures the validity of the distributive law.\n\n;First example (mental and written multiplication)\nDuring mental arithmetic, distributivity is often used unconsciously:\n\n::<math>6 \\cdot 16 = 6 \\cdot (10+6) = 6\\cdot 10 + 6 \\cdot 6 = 60+36 = 96</math>\nThus, to calculate {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 16}} in one's head, one first multiplies {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 10}} and {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 6}} and add the intermediate results. Written multiplication is also based on the distributive law.\n\n;Second example (with variables)\n::<math>3a^2b \\cdot (4a - 5b) = 3a^2b \\cdot 4a - 3a^2b \\cdot 5b = 12a^3b - 15a^2b^2</math>\n\n;Third example (with two sums)\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(a + b) \\cdot (a - b) & = a \\cdot (a - b) + b \\cdot (a - b) = a^2 - ab + ba - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 \\\\\n                      & = (a + b) \\cdot a - (a + b) \\cdot b = a^2 + ba - ab - b^2 = a^2 - b^2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:Here the distributive law was applied twice, and it does not matter which bracket is first multiplied out.\n\n;Fourth Example\n:Here the distributive law is applied the other way around compared to the previous examples. Consider\n::<math>12 a^3 b^2 - 30 a^4 b c + 18 a^2 b^3 c^2 \\,.</math>\n:Since the factor <math>6 a^2 b</math> occurs in all summands, it can be factored out. That is, due to the distributive law one obtains\n::<math>12 a^3 b^2 - 30 a^4 b c + 18 a^2 b^3 c^2 = 6 a^2 b (2 a b - 5 a^2 c + 3 b^2 c^2)\\,.</math>\n\n===Matrices===\nThe distributive law is valid for [[matrix multiplication]].

For example, the identity {{nowrap|1=\u2153 + \u2153 + \u2153 = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3}} appears to fail if the addition is conducted in [[decimal arithmetic]]; however, if many [[significant digit]]s are used, the calculation will result in a closer approximation to the correct results.  For example, if the arithmetical calculation takes the form: {{nowrap|1=0.33333 + 0.33333 + 0.33333 = 0.99999 \u2260 1}}, this result is a closer approximation than if fewer significant digits had been used.  Even when fractional numbers can be represented exactly in arithmetical form, errors will be introduced if those arithmetical values are rounded or truncated.  For example, buying two books, each priced at \u00a314.99 before a [[VAT|tax]] of 17.5%, in two separate transactions will actually save \u00a30.01, over buying them together: {{nowrap|1=\u00a314.99 \u00d7 1.175 = \u00a317.61}} to the nearest \u00a30.01, giving a total expenditure of \u00a335.22, but {{nowrap|1=\u00a329.98 \u00d7 1.175 = \u00a335.23}}.  Methods such as [[Rounding#Round half to even|banker's rounding]] may help in some cases, as may increasing the precision used, but ultimately some calculation errors are inevitable.\n\n==Distributivity in rings==\nDistributivity is most commonly found in [[ring (algebra)|ring]]s and [[distributive lattice]]s.\n\nA ring has two binary operations, + and * (commonly), and one of the requirements of a ring is that \u2217 must distribute over +.\nMost kinds of numbers (example 1) and matrices (example 4) form rings.\nA [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is another kind of [[algebraic structure]] with two binary operations, \u2227 and \u2228.\nIf either of these operations (say \u2227) distributes over the other (\u2228), then \u2228 must also distribute over \u2227, and the lattice is called distributive. See also the article on [[distributivity (order theory)]].\n\nExamples 4 and 5 are [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, which can be interpreted either as a special kind of ring (a [[Boolean ring]]) or a special kind of distributive lattice (a [[Boolean lattice]]). Each interpretation is responsible for different distributive laws in the Boolean algebra. Examples 6 and 7 are distributive lattices which are not Boolean algebras.\n\nFailure of one of the two distributive laws brings about [[near-ring]]s and [[near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s instead of rings and [[division ring]]s respectively. The operations are usually configured to have the near-ring or near-field distributive on the right but not on the left.\n\nRings and distributive lattices are both special kinds of [[rig (algebra)|rig]]s, certain generalizations of rings.\nThose numbers in example 1 that don't form rings at least form rigs.\n[[near-semiring|Near-rig]]s are a further generalization of rigs that are left-distributive but not right-distributive; example 2 is a near-rig.\n\n==Generalizations of distributivity==\n{{anchor|generalizations}}\nIn several mathematical areas, generalized distributivity laws are considered. This may involve the weakening of the above conditions or the extension to infinitary operations. Especially in [[order theory]] one finds numerous important variants of distributivity, some of which include infinitary operations, such as the [[infinite distributive law]]; others being defined in the presence of only ''one'' binary operation, such as the according definitions and their relations are given in the article [[distributivity (order theory)]]. This also includes the notion of a '''[[completely distributive lattice]]'''.\n\nIn the presence of an ordering relation, one can also weaken the above equalities by replacing = by either \u2264 or \u2265. Naturally, this will lead to meaningful concepts only in some situations. An application of this principle is the notion of '''sub-distributivity''' as explained in the article on [[interval arithmetic]].\n\nIn [[category theory]], if {{nowrap|(''S'', ''\u03bc'', ''\u03b7'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''S''\u2032, ''\u03bc''\u2032, ''\u03b7''\u2032)}} are [[monad (category theory)|monad]]s on a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'', a '''distributive law''' {{nowrap|''S''.''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032.''S''}} is a [[natural transformation]] {{nowrap|''\u03bb'' : ''S''.''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032.''S''}} such that {{nowrap|(''S''\u2032, ''\u03bb'')}} is a [[lax map of monads]] {{nowrap|''S'' \u2192 ''S''}} and {{nowrap|(''S'', ''\u03bb'')}} is a [[colax map of monads]] {{nowrap|''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032}}. This is exactly the data needed to define a monad structure on {{nowrap|''S''\u2032.''S''}}: the multiplication map is {{nowrap|''S''\u2032''\u03bc''.''\u03bc''\u2032''S''<sup>2</sup>.''S''\u2032''\u03bbS''}} and the unit map is ''\u03b7''\u2032''S''.''\u03b7''. See: [[distributive law between monads]].\n\nA [[generalized distributive law]] has also been proposed in the area of [[information theory]].\n\n=== Notions of antidistributivity ===\n\nThe ubiquitous [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] that relates inverses to the binary operation in any [[group (mathematics)|group]], namely {{nowrap|1=(''xy'')<sup>\u22121</sup> = ''y''<sup>\u22121</sup>''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, which is taken as an axiom in the more general context of a [[semigroup with involution]], has sometimes been called an '''antidistributive property''' (of inversion as a [[unary operation]]).<ref name=\"BrinkKahl1997\">{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of a [[near-ring]], which removes the commutativity of the additively written group and assumes only one-sided distributivity, one can speak of (two-sided) '''distributive elements''' but also of '''antidistributive elements'''. The latter reverse the order of (the non-commutative) addition; assuming a left-nearring (i.e. one which all elements distribute when multiplied on the left), then an antidistributive element ''a'' reverses the order of addition when multiplied to the right: {{nowrap|1=(''x'' + ''y'')''a'' = ''ya'' + ''xa''}}.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Celestina Cotti Ferrero|author2=Giovanni Ferrero|title=Nearrings: Some Developments Linked to Semigroups and Groups|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=978-1-4613-0267-4|pages=62 and 67}}</ref>\n\nIn the study of [[propositional logic]] and [[Boolean algebra]], the term '''antidistributive law''' is sometimes used to denote the interchange between conjunction and disjunction when implication factors over them:<ref name=\"Hehner1993\">{{cite book|author=[[Eric Hehner|Eric C.R.

The rules allow one to reformulate [[logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] within [[formal proof|logical proofs]].\n\nFor example, in [[arithmetic]]:\n: 2 \u22c5 (1 + 3) = (2 \u22c5 1) + (2 \u22c5 3), but 2 / (1 + 3) \u2260 (2 / 1) + (2 / 3).\n\nOn the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and 3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the products added afterward.\nBecause these give the same final answer (8),  multiplication by 2 is said to ''distribute'' over the addition of 1 and 3.\nSince one could have put any [[real number]]s in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained a true equation, [[multiplication]] of real numbers ''distributes'' over [[addition]] of real numbers.\n\n==Definition==\n\nGiven a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} and two [[binary operator]]s \u2217 and + on {{math|''S''}}, the operation * :\n\nis ''left-distributive'' over + if, [[given any]] elements {{math|''x'', ''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} of {{math|''S''}},\n:<math>x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z),</math>\n\nis ''right-distributive'' over + if, given any elements {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} of {{math|''S''}},\n:<math>(y + z) * x = (y * x) + (z * x),</math> and\n\nis ''distributive'' over + if it is left- and right-distributive.<ref>[http://mathonline.wikidot.com/distributivity-of-binary-operations Distributivity of Binary Operations] from Mathonline</ref>\n\nNotice that when \u2217 is [[commutative]], the three conditions above are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].\n\n==Meaning==\nThe operators used for examples in this section are the [[binary operation]]s of [[addition]] (<math>+</math>) and [[multiplication]] (<math>\\cdot</math>) of [[number]]s.\n\nThere is a distinction between left-distributivity and right-distributivity:\n\n:<math>a \\cdot \\left( b \\pm c \\right) = a \\cdot b \\pm a \\cdot c</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;(left-distributive)\n:<math>(a \\pm b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot c \\pm b \\cdot c</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;(right-distributive)\n\nIn either case, the distributive property can be described in words as:\n\nTo multiply a [[summation|sum]] (or [[difference (mathematics)|difference]]) by a factor, each summand (or [[minuend]] and [[subtrahend]]) is multiplied by this factor and the resulting products are added (or subtracted).\n\nIf the operation outside the parentheses (in this case, the multiplication) is commutative, then left-distributivity implies right-distributivity  and vice versa.\n\nOne example of an operation that is \"only\" right-distributive is division, which is not commutative:\n\n:<math>(a \\pm b) \\div c = a \\div c \\pm b \\div c</math> \nIn this case, left-distributivity does not apply:\n\n:<math>a \\div(b \\pm c) \\neq a \\div b \\pm a \\div c</math>\n\nThe distributive laws are among the axioms for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] (like the ring of [[integer]]s) and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] (like the field of [[rational number]]s). Here multiplication is distributive over addition, but addition is not distributive over multiplication. Examples of structures in which two operations are mutually related to each other by the distributive law (e.&nbsp;g., they distribute over each other) are [[Boolean algebras]] such as the [[algebra of sets]] or the [[switching algebra]].\n\nMultiplying sums can be put into words as follows: When a sum is multiplied by a sum, multiply each summand of a sum with each summand of the other sum (keeping track of signs) then add up all of the resulting products.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Real numbers===\nIn the following examples, the use of the distributive law on the set of real numbers <math>\\R</math> is illustrated. When multiplication is mentioned in elementary mathematics, it usually refers to this kind of multiplication. From the point of view of algebra, the real numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which ensures the validity of the distributive law.\n\n;First example (mental and written multiplication)\nDuring mental arithmetic, distributivity is often used unconsciously:\n\n::<math>6 \\cdot 16 = 6 \\cdot (10+6) = 6\\cdot 10 + 6 \\cdot 6 = 60+36 = 96</math>\nThus, to calculate {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 16}} in one's head, one first multiplies {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 10}} and {{nowrap|6 \u22c5 6}} and add the intermediate results. Written multiplication is also based on the distributive law.\n\n;Second example (with variables)\n::<math>3a^2b \\cdot (4a - 5b) = 3a^2b \\cdot 4a - 3a^2b \\cdot 5b = 12a^3b - 15a^2b^2</math>\n\n;Third example (with two sums)\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(a + b) \\cdot (a - b) & = a \\cdot (a - b) + b \\cdot (a - b) = a^2 - ab + ba - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 \\\\\n                      & = (a + b) \\cdot a - (a + b) \\cdot b = a^2 + ba - ab - b^2 = a^2 - b^2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:Here the distributive law was applied twice, and it does not matter which bracket is first multiplied out.\n\n;Fourth Example\n:Here the distributive law is applied the other way around compared to the previous examples. Consider\n::<math>12 a^3 b^2 - 30 a^4 b c + 18 a^2 b^3 c^2 \\,.</math>\n:Since the factor <math>6 a^2 b</math> occurs in all summands, it can be factored out. That is, due to the distributive law one obtains\n::<math>12 a^3 b^2 - 30 a^4 b c + 18 a^2 b^3 c^2 = 6 a^2 b (2 a b - 5 a^2 c + 3 b^2 c^2)\\,.</math>\n\n===Matrices===\nThe distributive law is valid for [[matrix multiplication]]. More precisely,\n\n:<math>(A + B) \\cdot C = A \\cdot C + B \\cdot C</math>\nfor all  <math>l \\times m</math>-matrices <math>A,B</math> and <math>m \\times n</math>-matrices <math> C</math>, as well as\n\n:<math>A \\cdot (B + C) = A \\cdot B + A \\cdot C</math>\nfor all  <math>l \\times m</math>-matrices <math>A</math> and <math>m \\times n</math>-matrices <math>B, C</math>.  Because the commutative property does not hold for matrix multiplication, the second law does not follow from the first law.

See also the article on [[distributivity (order theory)]].\n\nExamples 4 and 5 are [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, which can be interpreted either as a special kind of ring (a [[Boolean ring]]) or a special kind of distributive lattice (a [[Boolean lattice]]). Each interpretation is responsible for different distributive laws in the Boolean algebra. Examples 6 and 7 are distributive lattices which are not Boolean algebras.\n\nFailure of one of the two distributive laws brings about [[near-ring]]s and [[near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s instead of rings and [[division ring]]s respectively. The operations are usually configured to have the near-ring or near-field distributive on the right but not on the left.\n\nRings and distributive lattices are both special kinds of [[rig (algebra)|rig]]s, certain generalizations of rings.\nThose numbers in example 1 that don't form rings at least form rigs.\n[[near-semiring|Near-rig]]s are a further generalization of rigs that are left-distributive but not right-distributive; example 2 is a near-rig.\n\n==Generalizations of distributivity==\n{{anchor|generalizations}}\nIn several mathematical areas, generalized distributivity laws are considered. This may involve the weakening of the above conditions or the extension to infinitary operations. Especially in [[order theory]] one finds numerous important variants of distributivity, some of which include infinitary operations, such as the [[infinite distributive law]]; others being defined in the presence of only ''one'' binary operation, such as the according definitions and their relations are given in the article [[distributivity (order theory)]]. This also includes the notion of a '''[[completely distributive lattice]]'''.\n\nIn the presence of an ordering relation, one can also weaken the above equalities by replacing = by either \u2264 or \u2265. Naturally, this will lead to meaningful concepts only in some situations. An application of this principle is the notion of '''sub-distributivity''' as explained in the article on [[interval arithmetic]].\n\nIn [[category theory]], if {{nowrap|(''S'', ''\u03bc'', ''\u03b7'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''S''\u2032, ''\u03bc''\u2032, ''\u03b7''\u2032)}} are [[monad (category theory)|monad]]s on a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'', a '''distributive law''' {{nowrap|''S''.''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032.''S''}} is a [[natural transformation]] {{nowrap|''\u03bb'' : ''S''.''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032.''S''}} such that {{nowrap|(''S''\u2032, ''\u03bb'')}} is a [[lax map of monads]] {{nowrap|''S'' \u2192 ''S''}} and {{nowrap|(''S'', ''\u03bb'')}} is a [[colax map of monads]] {{nowrap|''S''\u2032 \u2192 ''S''\u2032}}. This is exactly the data needed to define a monad structure on {{nowrap|''S''\u2032.''S''}}: the multiplication map is {{nowrap|''S''\u2032''\u03bc''.''\u03bc''\u2032''S''<sup>2</sup>.''S''\u2032''\u03bbS''}} and the unit map is ''\u03b7''\u2032''S''.''\u03b7''. See: [[distributive law between monads]].\n\nA [[generalized distributive law]] has also been proposed in the area of [[information theory]].\n\n=== Notions of antidistributivity ===\n\nThe ubiquitous [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] that relates inverses to the binary operation in any [[group (mathematics)|group]], namely {{nowrap|1=(''xy'')<sup>\u22121</sup> = ''y''<sup>\u22121</sup>''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, which is taken as an axiom in the more general context of a [[semigroup with involution]], has sometimes been called an '''antidistributive property''' (of inversion as a [[unary operation]]).<ref name=\"BrinkKahl1997\">{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of a [[near-ring]], which removes the commutativity of the additively written group and assumes only one-sided distributivity, one can speak of (two-sided) '''distributive elements''' but also of '''antidistributive elements'''. The latter reverse the order of (the non-commutative) addition; assuming a left-nearring (i.e. one which all elements distribute when multiplied on the left), then an antidistributive element ''a'' reverses the order of addition when multiplied to the right: {{nowrap|1=(''x'' + ''y'')''a'' = ''ya'' + ''xa''}}.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Celestina Cotti Ferrero|author2=Giovanni Ferrero|title=Nearrings: Some Developments Linked to Semigroups and Groups|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=978-1-4613-0267-4|pages=62 and 67}}</ref>\n\nIn the study of [[propositional logic]] and [[Boolean algebra]], the term '''antidistributive law''' is sometimes used to denote the interchange between conjunction and disjunction when implication factors over them:<ref name=\"Hehner1993\">{{cite book|author=[[Eric Hehner|Eric C.R.
