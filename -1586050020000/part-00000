The ship is captained by the incompetent Cornelius Butt ([[Avery Schreiber]]) and his crewmen: his first officer, Sgt. Thor ([[Stephen Macht]]); pilot \"space-cowboy\" Pvt. Robert \"Buzz\" McHenry (J.D. Hinton); Maurice (Lionel Mark Smith), a black humanoid alien with pointy ears and bat wings; and Sam ([[Tad Horino]]), an Asian man who quotes [[Confucius]]. Also aboard is Galaxina (Dorothy Stratten), a voluptuous blonde [[android (robot)|android]] servant, and Rock-Eater, a rock-eating alien prisoner confined to the brig.\n\nWhile the ''Infinity'' hides behind an [[asteroid]], a suspicious-looking, bird-like ship flies by, and Buzz decides to pursue it. They try to question the ship's pilot, a mysterious masked figure who rudely terminates communications. The two ships exchange [[laser gun|laser fire]], but the bird-ship gets away. After the encounter, Galaxina serves a dinner of chicken-flavored food pills to Captain Butt, Thor, and Buzz. The three men are stunned by her beauty, and Thor receives an electric shock when he slaps her buttocks. Tired of the pill-food, Captain Butt decides to eat an alien egg confiscated from the rock eater prisoner. The egg sickens him, and, on top of the dinner table mimicking the scene from the movie \"Alien,\" he coughs up a baby alien creature that quickly scurries away.\n\nLater, the crew receive orders to proceed to the prison planet Altair One to recover a priceless stolen gemstone called the Blue Star; every time the stone is mentioned, an invisible heavenly chorus is heard by the characters. The trip will take the ''Infinity'' 27 years to complete, requiring that the crew enter cryogenic sleep. Before doing so, they make a quick stop at an asteroid [[brothel]].\n\nGalaxina remains in charge of the ship while the crew is in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. While alone, she reprograms herself to become more human. She learns to talk and disables her electrical defense mechanism. She visits Thor's sleep chamber periodically, embracing it and telling the sleeping Thor that she loves him. Later, the baby alien visits Butt's chamber and tampers with the controls. When the crew awakens at their destination, Butt emerges from his pod an old man with shaggy gray hair.\n\nThor is seduced by Galaxina and he falls in love with her. Although she lacks the proper hardware to have sex, she assures Thor that these components can be ordered from the android catalog. Thor can only fantasize about Galaxina until they return home and get her modifications.\n\nThe ship reaches Altair One and lands. Knowing that the local aliens are hostile to humans, Galaxina volunteers to go look for the Blue Star while the others stay on the ship. She walks into town and enters a \"human restaurant,\" and discovers that this means the restaurant serves humans as food to alien creatures. There, she finds Ordric, the masked figure the crew encountered earlier. Ordric possesses the Blue Star and Galaxina attacks him. Galaxina discovers Ordric is a [[robot]] when she smashes his head open. Ordric is deactivated and Galaxina takes the Star.\n\nAs she flees the town, she is captured by a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|gang of bikers]], descendants of the first settlers of Altair One. Their leader announces that he will sacrifice Galaxina to their deity, \"[[Harley Davidson|Harley-David-Son]]\", and with the power of the Blue Star he will take control of the universe.\n\nThor and Buzz, who have been looking for Galaxina, rescue her from the bikers and return to the ship. Ordric attacks and boards the ''Infinity'' as soon as they reach space. He takes back the Blue Star and confines everyone in the brig. The baby alien, now fully grown, sneaks onto the bridge and attacks Ordric. The creature, believing Butt to be its mother, goes to the brig and gives Butt the keys to the cell door.\n\nThe crew escapes the brig and rushes the bridge, finding that Ordric has been torn to pieces. While contemplating the reward they will receive for returning the Blue Star, they notice that Rock-Eater has eaten it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Macht]] as Sgt.

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].\n\nTo do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a \"final control element\", such as a [[control valve]].<ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992). A history of control engineering, 1930-1955. IET. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-299-8}}.</ref>\n\nExtensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the [[block diagram]]. In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.\n\nControl theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}</ref>  Control theory was further advanced by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of [[PID control]] theory by [[Nicolas Minorsky]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280\u2013309 |issue=2 |ref=harv  |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}</ref>\nAlthough a major application of control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of [[process control]] systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this.  As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Centrifugal governor]] in a [[Boulton & Watt engine]] of 1788]]\n\nAlthough control systems of various types date back to antiquity, a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the [[centrifugal governor]], conducted by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868, entitled ''On Governors''.<ref name=\"Maxwell1867\">{{cite journal|author=Maxwell, J.C.|year=1868|title=On Governors|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=16|pages=270\u2013283|doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055|jstor=112510}}<!--| accessdate = 2008-04-14--></ref> A centrifugal governor was already used to regulate the velocity of windmills.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.302.5633&rep=rep1&type=pdf Control Theory: History, Mathematical Achievements and Perspectives | E.

The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.\n\nBy [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang\u2013bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8\u201312|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich/page/241 241\u2013242]}}</ref> Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].\n\nSometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]] that obeys the [[Good regulator|good regulator theorem]]. So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract \"useful work\" (profits) from it). In AI, an example might be a chatbot modelling the discourse state of humans: the more accurately it can model the human state (e.g. on a telephone voice-support hotline), the better it can manipulate the human (e.g. into performing the corrective actions to resolve the problem that caused the phone call to the help-line).  These last two examples take the narrow historical interpretation of control theory as a set of differential equations modeling and regulating kinetic motion, and broaden it into a vast generalization of a [[controller (control theory)|regulator]] interacting with a [[plant (control theory)|plant]].\n\n==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]\n[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.\n\nIn open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.\n\nIn closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the \"Reference input\" or  \"set point\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\" <ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970\n|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLikewise; \"A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Other examples===\nAn example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.\n\nA primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of non-flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.\n\nIn a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n==Classical control theory==\n{{main|Classical control theory}}\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].\nA [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is \"fed back\" as input to the process, closing the loop.\n\nClosed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:\n* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)\n* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact\n* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized\n* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations\n* improved reference tracking performance\n\nIn some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.\n\nA common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].\n\n==Closed-loop transfer function==\n{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}\nThe output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.\n\nThis is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).\n\n[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]\n\nIf we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:\n\n: <math>Y(s) = P(s) U(s)</math>\n: <math>U(s) = C(s) E(s)</math>\n: <math>E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).</math>\n\nSolving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives\n\n: <math>Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \\right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).</math>\n\nThe expression <math>H(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}</math> is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If <math>|P(s)C(s)| \\gg 1</math>, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if <math>|F(s)| \\approx 1</math>, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.\n\n==PID feedback control==\n{{main |PID Controller}}\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.\n\nA PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\nThe [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.\n\nIf ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and <math>e(t)=r(t)- y(t)</math> is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form\n\n:<math>u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \\int e(\\tau)\\text{d}\\tau + K_D \\frac{\\text{d}e(t)}{\\text{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters <math> K_P</math>, <math> K_I</math> and <math> K_D</math>, often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.\n\nApplying [[Laplace transform|Laplace transformation]] results in the transformed PID controller equation\n\n:<math>u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \\frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)</math>\n:<math>u(s) =  \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right) e(s)</math>\n\nwith the PID controller transfer function\n:<math>C(s) = \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right).</math>\n\nAs an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system <math>H(s)</math>, consider a 1st order plant given by\n\n:<math>P(s) = \\frac{A}{1 + sT_P}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>T_P</math> are some constants. The plant output is fed back through\n\n:<math>F(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + sT_F}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_F</math> is also a constant. Now if we set <math>K_P=K\\left(1+\\frac{T_D}{T_I}\\right)</math>, <math>K_D=KT_D</math>, and <math>K_I=\\frac{K}{T_I}</math>, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as\n\n:<math>C(s) =  K \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sT_I}\\right)(1 + sT_D)</math>\n\nPlugging <math>P(s)</math>, <math>F(s)</math>, and <math>C(s)</math> into the closed-loop transfer function <math>H(s)</math>, we find that by setting\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P</math>\n\n<math>H(s) = 1</math>. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.\n\nHowever, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013576|doi=10.1109/TCST.2005.847331 }}</ref> due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead\u2013lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.\n\n==Linear and nonlinear control theory==\nThe field of control theory can be divided into two branches:\n* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' \u2013 This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. \n* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' \u2013 This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincar\u00e9 map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]</ref>\n\n==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==\nMathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:\n* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.\n* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.\nIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the \"time-domain approach\") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. \"State space\" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.<ref>{{cite book|title=State space & linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=978-0-07-070096-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality \u2014AND\u2014 Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|issue=9|year=1999|pages=705\u2013719 and 812\u2013828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614|jstor=2589614}}</ref>\n\n==System interfacing - SISO & MIMO==\nControl systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.\n* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) \u2013 This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. \n* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) \u2013 These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.\n\n==Topics in control theory==\n\n===Stability===\n\nThe ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.\n*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.\n*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.\n\nFor simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.\n\nMathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside\n* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.\n* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.\nThe difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the <math>x</math> axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the <math>\\rho</math> axis is the real axis.\n\nWhen the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.\n\nIf a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole in <math>z = 0.5</math> (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.\n\nHowever, if the impulse response was\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform is\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole at <math>z = 1.5</math> and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.\n\nNumerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.\n\nMechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.\n\n===Controllability and observability===\n{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}\n\n[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every \"bad\" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.\n\nSolutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.\n\n===Control specification===\nSeveral different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).\n\nA control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have <math>Re[\\lambda] < -\\overline{\\lambda}</math>, where <math>\\overline{\\lambda}</math> is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that <math>Re[\\lambda]<0</math>.\n\nAnother typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.\n\nOther \"classical\" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).\n\nModern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE, ISA, CQI).\n\n===Model identification and robustness===\nA control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.\n\n;System identification\n{{details|System identification}}\nThe process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass\u2013spring\u2013damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that <math> m \\ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \\Beta \\dot{x}(t)</math>. Even assuming that a \"complete\" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called \"nominal parameters\") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.\n\nSome advanced control techniques include an \"on-line\" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (\"identified\") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.\n\n;Analysis\nAnalysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.\n\n;Constraints\nA particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.\n\n==System classifications==\n\n===Linear systems control===\n{{Main|State space (controls)}}\nFor MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.\n\n===Nonlinear systems control===\n{{Main|Nonlinear control}}\nProcesses in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.<ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al>{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |volume = 6 |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |lay-url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G |pmid = 26423222 |pmc = 4600713 |page = 8414}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralized systems control===\n{{Main|Distributed control system}}\nWhen the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.\n\n===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===\n{{Main|Stochastic control}}\n\nA stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.\n\n==Main control strategies==\nEvery control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.\n\n;List of the main control techniques\n\n*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.\n*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].\n*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746\u20132759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}</ref> [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] or a combination of these methods, such as [[neuro-fuzzy]] algorithms, to control a [[dynamic system]].\n*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain \"cost index\": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the \"optimal control\" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].\n*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |volume=02|issue=4|pages=L285\u2013L292|date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}</ref> The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.

The control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection (in a power-preserving manner) in order to achieve a desired behavior.\n*[[Self-organized criticality control]] may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the [[self-organized]] system dissipates energy.\n\n==People in systems and control==\n{{Main|People in systems and control}}\nMany active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] invented the [[Z-transform]] in his work on [[probability theory]], now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems.

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].\n\nTo do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a \"final control element\", such as a [[control valve]].<ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992).

In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.\n\nControl theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.\n\nBy [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang\u2013bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8\u201312|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich/page/241 241\u2013242]}}</ref> Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].\n\nSometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]] that obeys the [[Good regulator|good regulator theorem]]. So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract \"useful work\" (profits) from it). In AI, an example might be a chatbot modelling the discourse state of humans: the more accurately it can model the human state (e.g. on a telephone voice-support hotline), the better it can manipulate the human (e.g. into performing the corrective actions to resolve the problem that caused the phone call to the help-line).  These last two examples take the narrow historical interpretation of control theory as a set of differential equations modeling and regulating kinetic motion, and broaden it into a vast generalization of a [[controller (control theory)|regulator]] interacting with a [[plant (control theory)|plant]].\n\n==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]\n[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.\n\nIn open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.\n\nIn closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the \"Reference input\" or  \"set point\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\" <ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970\n|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLikewise; \"A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Other examples===\nAn example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.\n\nA primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of non-flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.\n\nIn a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n==Classical control theory==\n{{main|Classical control theory}}\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].\nA [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is \"fed back\" as input to the process, closing the loop.\n\nClosed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:\n* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)\n* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact\n* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized\n* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations\n* improved reference tracking performance\n\nIn some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.\n\nA common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].\n\n==Closed-loop transfer function==\n{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}\nThe output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.\n\nThis is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).\n\n[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]\n\nIf we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:\n\n: <math>Y(s) = P(s) U(s)</math>\n: <math>U(s) = C(s) E(s)</math>\n: <math>E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).</math>\n\nSolving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives\n\n: <math>Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \\right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).</math>\n\nThe expression <math>H(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}</math> is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If <math>|P(s)C(s)| \\gg 1</math>, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if <math>|F(s)| \\approx 1</math>, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.\n\n==PID feedback control==\n{{main |PID Controller}}\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.\n\nA PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\nThe [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.\n\nIf ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and <math>e(t)=r(t)- y(t)</math> is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form\n\n:<math>u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \\int e(\\tau)\\text{d}\\tau + K_D \\frac{\\text{d}e(t)}{\\text{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters <math> K_P</math>, <math> K_I</math> and <math> K_D</math>, often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.\n\nApplying [[Laplace transform|Laplace transformation]] results in the transformed PID controller equation\n\n:<math>u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \\frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)</math>\n:<math>u(s) =  \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right) e(s)</math>\n\nwith the PID controller transfer function\n:<math>C(s) = \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right).</math>\n\nAs an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system <math>H(s)</math>, consider a 1st order plant given by\n\n:<math>P(s) = \\frac{A}{1 + sT_P}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>T_P</math> are some constants. The plant output is fed back through\n\n:<math>F(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + sT_F}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_F</math> is also a constant. Now if we set <math>K_P=K\\left(1+\\frac{T_D}{T_I}\\right)</math>, <math>K_D=KT_D</math>, and <math>K_I=\\frac{K}{T_I}</math>, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as\n\n:<math>C(s) =  K \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sT_I}\\right)(1 + sT_D)</math>\n\nPlugging <math>P(s)</math>, <math>F(s)</math>, and <math>C(s)</math> into the closed-loop transfer function <math>H(s)</math>, we find that by setting\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P</math>\n\n<math>H(s) = 1</math>. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.\n\nHowever, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013576|doi=10.1109/TCST.2005.847331 }}</ref> due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead\u2013lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.\n\n==Linear and nonlinear control theory==\nThe field of control theory can be divided into two branches:\n* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' \u2013 This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. \n* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' \u2013 This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincar\u00e9 map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]</ref>\n\n==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==\nMathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:\n* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.\n* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.\nIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the \"time-domain approach\") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. \"State space\" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.<ref>{{cite book|title=State space & linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=978-0-07-070096-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality \u2014AND\u2014 Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|issue=9|year=1999|pages=705\u2013719 and 812\u2013828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614|jstor=2589614}}</ref>\n\n==System interfacing - SISO & MIMO==\nControl systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.\n* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) \u2013 This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. \n* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) \u2013 These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.\n\n==Topics in control theory==\n\n===Stability===\n\nThe ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.\n*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.\n*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.\n\nFor simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.\n\nMathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside\n* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.\n* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.\nThe difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the <math>x</math> axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the <math>\\rho</math> axis is the real axis.\n\nWhen the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.\n\nIf a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole in <math>z = 0.5</math> (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.\n\nHowever, if the impulse response was\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform is\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole at <math>z = 1.5</math> and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.\n\nNumerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.\n\nMechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.\n\n===Controllability and observability===\n{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}\n\n[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every \"bad\" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.\n\nSolutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.\n\n===Control specification===\nSeveral different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).\n\nA control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have <math>Re[\\lambda] < -\\overline{\\lambda}</math>, where <math>\\overline{\\lambda}</math> is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that <math>Re[\\lambda]<0</math>.\n\nAnother typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.\n\nOther \"classical\" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).\n\nModern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE,ISA,CQI).\n\n===Model identification and robustness===\nA control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.\n\n;System identification\n{{details|System identification}}\nThe process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass\u2013spring\u2013damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that <math> m \\ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \\Beta \\dot{x}(t)</math>. Even assuming that a \"complete\" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called \"nominal parameters\") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.\n\nSome advanced control techniques include an \"on-line\" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (\"identified\") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.\n\n;Analysis\nAnalysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.\n\n;Constraints\nA particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.\n\n==System classifications==\n\n===Linear systems control===\n{{Main|State space (controls)}}\nFor MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.\n\n===Nonlinear systems control===\n{{Main|Nonlinear control}}\nProcesses in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.<ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al>{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |volume = 6 |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |lay-url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G |pmid = 26423222 |pmc = 4600713 |page = 8414}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralized systems control===\n{{Main|Distributed control system}}\nWhen the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.\n\n===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===\n{{Main|Stochastic control}}\n\nA stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.\n\n==Main control strategies==\nEvery control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.\n\n;List of the main control techniques\n\n*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.\n*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].\n*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746\u20132759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}</ref> [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] or a combination of these methods, such as [[neuro-fuzzy]] algorithms, to control a [[dynamic system]].\n*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain \"cost index\": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the \"optimal control\" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].\n*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |volume=02|issue=4|pages=L285\u2013L292|date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}</ref> The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.

In 1948, he undertook a project funded by the [[March of Dimes|National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. Salk saw an opportunity to extend this project towards developing a vaccine against polio, and he gathered a research team and devoted himself to this work for the next seven years. The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, \"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.\" Over 1.8 million schoolchildren took part in the trial.<ref name=Rose>Rose DR (2004). \"Fact Sheet\u2014Polio Vaccine Field Trial of 1954.\" March of Dimes Archives. 2004 02 11.</ref> News was made public of the vaccine's success on April 12, 1955, and Salk was hailed as a \"miracle worker\" and the day almost became a national holiday. An immediate rush to vaccinate began around the world, with countries beginning polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine, including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium.\n\nSalk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a \"moral commitment\".<ref name=usa>Jacobs, Charlotte DeCroes.

Named after the founder of [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), it was, said Oshinsky, \"a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money\u2014and pedigree\u2014to attend a top private school.\" In high school \"he was known as a perfectionist ... who read everything he could lay his hands on,\" according to one of his fellow students.<ref name=Bookchin>Bookchin, Debbie, and Schumacher, Jim. ''The Virus and the Vaccine'', Macmillan (2004) {{ISBN|0-312-34272-1}}</ref> Students had to cram a four-year curriculum into just three years.

''Polio: An American Story'', Oxford Univ. Press (2006)</ref>{{rp|96}}\n\n===Education===\nSalk enrolled in CCNY from which he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in chemistry in 1934.<ref name=sherrow>Sherrow, Victoria: ''Jonas Salk, Revised Edition'' (2009), p. 12</ref> Oshinsky writes that \"for working-class immigrant families, City College represented the apex of public higher education. Getting in was tough, but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAt his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were \"barely second rate.\" There were no research laboratories; the library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there ... driven by their parents. ... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more [[Nobel Prize]] winners\u2014eight\u2014and PhD recipients than any other public college except the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a child, Salk did not show any interest in medicine or science in general. He said in an interview with the [[Academy of Achievement]],<ref>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-1 Jonas Salk interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904233007/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-1 |date=September 4, 2008 }} interview with Academy of Achievement</ref> \"As a child I was not interested in science. I was merely interested in things human, the human side of nature, if you like, and I continue to be interested in that.\"\n\n===Medical school===\n\nAfter City College, Salk enrolled in [[New York University]] to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as [[Walter Reed]], who helped conquer [[yellow fever]]. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools\u2014[[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]\u2014had rigid [[Jewish quota|quotas]] in place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in.<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}} During his years at [[New York University School of Medicine|New York University Medical School]], Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer.<ref name=sherrow/>\n\nDuring Salk's medical studies, he stood out from his peers, according to Bookchin, \"not just because of his continued academic prowess\u2014he was [[Alpha Omega Alpha]], the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society of medical education\u2014but because he had decided he did not want to practice medicine.\" Instead, he became absorbed in research, even taking a year off to study [[biochemistry]]. He later focused more of his studies on [[Microbiology|bacteriology]] which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients.<ref name=Bookchin/> \"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAccording to Salk: \"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Jonas Salk Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/jonas-salk-m-d/#interview}}</ref>\n\nConcerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize. And so, by carefully designed experiments, we found it was possible to do so.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722025220/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-2 |archivedate=July 22, 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Postgraduate research and early laboratory work===\n\nIn 1941, during his postgraduate work in virology, Salk chose a two-month elective to work in the laboratory of [[Thomas Francis, Jr.|Thomas Francis]] at the [[University of Michigan]]. Francis had recently joined the faculty of the medical school after working for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], where he had discovered the type B [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]]. According to Bookchin, \"the two-month stint in Francis's lab was Salk's first introduction to the world of [[virology]]\u2014and he was hooked.\"<ref name=Bookchin/>{{rp|25}} After graduating from medical school, Salk began his residency at New York's prestigious<ref name=Oshinsky/> [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], where he again worked in Francis's laboratory.<ref name=Oshinsky/> Salk then worked at the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health]] with Francis, on an army-commissioned project in Michigan to develop an influenza vaccine. He and Francis eventually perfected a vaccine that was soon widely used at army bases, where Salk discovered and isolated one of the strains of influenza that was included in the final vaccine.<ref name=Bookchin/>{{rp|26}}\n\n==Polio research==\n{{further|Polio|Polio vaccine}}\n[[File:Roosevelt OConnor.jpg|thumb|left|President Franklin D.

He asked Salk to find out if there were more types of polio than the three then known, offering additional space, equipment and researchers.

After successful tests on laboratory animals, on July 2, 1952, assisted by the staff at the D.T. Watson Home for Crippled Children, Salk injected 43 children with his killed-virus vaccine. A few weeks later, Salk injected children at the Polk State School for the retarded and feeble-minded. In 1954 he tested the vaccine on about one million children, known as the polio pioneers.

His alma mater, City College of New York, gave him an honorary degree as Doctor of Laws. But \"despite such very nice tributes\", ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"Salk is profoundly disturbed by the torrent of fame that has descended upon him. ... He talks continually about getting out of the limelight and back to his laboratory ... because of his genuine distaste for publicity, which he believes is inappropriate for a scientist.\"<ref name=NYT7-17-55/>\n\nDuring a 1980 interview, 25 years later, he said, \"It's as if I've been a public property ever since, having to respond to external, as well as internal, impulses. ...

Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, \"I thought how nice it would be if a place like this existed and I was invited to work there.\" This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1966, Salk described his \"ambitious plan for the creation of a kind of [[Socratic method|Socratic]] academy where the supposedly alienated two cultures of science and humanism will have a favorable atmosphere for cross-fertilization.\"<ref name=Taubman/> Author and journalist [[Howard Taubman]] explained:\n\n{{quote|Although he is distinctly future-oriented, Dr. Salk has not lost sight of the institute's immediate aim, which is the development and use of the new biology, called [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cellular biology]], described as part physics, part chemistry and part biology. The broad-gauged purpose of this science is to understand man's life processes.\n\nThere is talk here of the possibility, once the secret of how the cell is triggered to manufacture [[antibodies]] is discovered, that a single vaccine may be developed to protect a child against many common infectious diseases. There is speculation about the power to isolate and perhaps eliminate genetic errors that lead to birth defects.\n\nDr. Salk, a creative man himself, hopes that the institute will do its share in probing the wisdom of nature and thus help enlarge the wisdom of man. For the ultimate purpose of science, humanism and the arts, in his judgment, is the freeing of each individual to cultivate his full creativity, in whichever direction it leads. ... As if to prepare for Socratic encounters such as these, the institute's architect, [[Louis Kahn]], has installed blackboards in place of concrete facings on the walls along the walks.<ref name=Taubman/>|sign=|source=}}\n\n''The New York Times'', in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Salk vaccine, described the current workings at the facility:\n\n<blockquote>At the institute, a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, Dr. Salk holds the titles of founding director and resident fellow.

As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\"<ref name=Taubman>Taubman, Howard.

Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.\n\nSalk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, ''Man's Unfolding'', and ''The Survival of the Wisest''. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:\n\n<blockquote>I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. ... People think of [[biology]] in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. ... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.<ref name=NYT4-8-80/></blockquote>\n\nHis definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/openmind_ep1234 \"Man Evolving\"] video interview, 1985, 28 minutes</ref>\n\nJust prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled ''Millennium of the Mind''.\n\n==Personal life==\nThe day after his graduation from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. [[David Oshinsky]] writes that Donna's father, Elmer Lindsay, \"a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors.\" Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his \"rather pedestrian status\" by giving himself a middle name.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nThey had three children: Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan Salk.

In 1948, he undertook a project funded by the [[March of Dimes|National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. Salk saw an opportunity to extend this project towards developing a vaccine against polio, and he gathered a research team and devoted himself to this work for the next seven years. The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, \"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.\" Over 1.8 million schoolchildren took part in the trial.<ref name=Rose>Rose DR (2004). \"Fact Sheet\u2014Polio Vaccine Field Trial of 1954.\" March of Dimes Archives. 2004 02 11.</ref> News was made public of the vaccine's success on April 12, 1955, and Salk was hailed as a \"miracle worker\" and the day almost became a national holiday. An immediate rush to vaccinate began around the world, with countries beginning polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine, including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium.\n\nSalk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a \"moral commitment\".<ref name=usa>Jacobs, Charlotte DeCroes.

Named after the founder of [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), it was, said Oshinsky, \"a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money\u2014and pedigree\u2014to attend a top private school.\" In high school \"he was known as a perfectionist ... who read everything he could lay his hands on,\" according to one of his fellow students.<ref name=Bookchin>Bookchin, Debbie, and Schumacher, Jim. ''The Virus and the Vaccine'', Macmillan (2004) {{ISBN|0-312-34272-1}}</ref> Students had to cram a four-year curriculum into just three years. As a result, most dropped out or flunked out, despite the school's motto \"study, study, study.\" Of the students who graduated, however, most would have the grades to enroll in CCNY, noted for being a highly competitive college.<ref name=Oshinsky>Oshinsky, David M. ''Polio: An American Story'', Oxford Univ. Press (2006)</ref>{{rp|96}}\n\n===Education===\nSalk enrolled in CCNY from which he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in chemistry in 1934.<ref name=sherrow>Sherrow, Victoria: ''Jonas Salk, Revised Edition'' (2009), p. 12</ref> Oshinsky writes that \"for working-class immigrant families, City College represented the apex of public higher education. Getting in was tough, but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAt his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were \"barely second rate.\" There were no research laboratories; the library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there ... driven by their parents. ... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more [[Nobel Prize]] winners\u2014eight\u2014and PhD recipients than any other public college except the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a child, Salk did not show any interest in medicine or science in general. He said in an interview with the [[Academy of Achievement]],<ref>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-1 Jonas Salk interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904233007/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-1 |date=September 4, 2008 }} interview with Academy of Achievement</ref> \"As a child I was not interested in science. I was merely interested in things human, the human side of nature, if you like, and I continue to be interested in that.\"\n\n===Medical school===\n\nAfter City College, Salk enrolled in [[New York University]] to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as [[Walter Reed]], who helped conquer [[yellow fever]]. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools\u2014[[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]\u2014had rigid [[Jewish quota|quotas]] in place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in.<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}} During his years at [[New York University School of Medicine|New York University Medical School]], Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer.<ref name=sherrow/>\n\nDuring Salk's medical studies, he stood out from his peers, according to Bookchin, \"not just because of his continued academic prowess\u2014he was [[Alpha Omega Alpha]], the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society of medical education\u2014but because he had decided he did not want to practice medicine.\" Instead, he became absorbed in research, even taking a year off to study [[biochemistry]]. He later focused more of his studies on [[Microbiology|bacteriology]] which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients.<ref name=Bookchin/> \"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAccording to Salk: \"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Jonas Salk Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/jonas-salk-m-d/#interview}}</ref>\n\nConcerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize. And so, by carefully designed experiments, we found it was possible to do so.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722025220/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/sal0int-2 |archivedate=July 22, 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Postgraduate research and early laboratory work===\n\nIn 1941, during his postgraduate work in virology, Salk chose a two-month elective to work in the laboratory of [[Thomas Francis, Jr.|Thomas Francis]] at the [[University of Michigan]]. Francis had recently joined the faculty of the medical school after working for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], where he had discovered the type B [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]]. According to Bookchin, \"the two-month stint in Francis's lab was Salk's first introduction to the world of [[virology]]\u2014and he was hooked.\"<ref name=Bookchin/>{{rp|25}} After graduating from medical school, Salk began his residency at New York's prestigious<ref name=Oshinsky/> [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], where he again worked in Francis's laboratory.<ref name=Oshinsky/> Salk then worked at the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health]] with Francis, on an army-commissioned project in Michigan to develop an influenza vaccine. He and Francis eventually perfected a vaccine that was soon widely used at army bases, where Salk discovered and isolated one of the strains of influenza that was included in the final vaccine.<ref name=Bookchin/>{{rp|26}}\n\n==Polio research==\n{{further|Polio|Polio vaccine}}\n[[File:Roosevelt OConnor.jpg|thumb|left|President Franklin D.

He asked Salk to find out if there were more types of polio than the three then known, offering additional space, equipment and researchers.

After successful tests on laboratory animals, on July 2, 1952, assisted by the staff at the D.T. Watson Home for Crippled Children, Salk injected 43 children with his killed-virus vaccine. A few weeks later, Salk injected children at the Polk State School for the retarded and feeble-minded. In 1954 he tested the vaccine on about one million children, known as the polio pioneers.

As one of the only living scientists whose face was known the world over, Salk, in the public's eye, had a superstar aura.

His alma mater, City College of New York, gave him an honorary degree as Doctor of Laws. But \"despite such very nice tributes\", ''The New York Times'' wrote, \"Salk is profoundly disturbed by the torrent of fame that has descended upon him. ... He talks continually about getting out of the limelight and back to his laboratory ... because of his genuine distaste for publicity, which he believes is inappropriate for a scientist.\"<ref name=NYT7-17-55/>\n\nDuring a 1980 interview, 25 years later, he said, \"It's as if I've been a public property ever since, having to respond to external, as well as internal, impulses. ...

Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, \"I thought how nice it would be if a place like this existed and I was invited to work there.\" This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1966, Salk described his \"ambitious plan for the creation of a kind of [[Socratic method|Socratic]] academy where the supposedly alienated two cultures of science and humanism will have a favorable atmosphere for cross-fertilization.\"<ref name=Taubman/> Author and journalist [[Howard Taubman]] explained:\n\n{{quote|Although he is distinctly future-oriented, Dr. Salk has not lost sight of the institute's immediate aim, which is the development and use of the new biology, called [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cellular biology]], described as part physics, part chemistry and part biology. The broad-gauged purpose of this science is to understand man's life processes.\n\nThere is talk here of the possibility, once the secret of how the cell is triggered to manufacture [[antibodies]] is discovered, that a single vaccine may be developed to protect a child against many common infectious diseases. There is speculation about the power to isolate and perhaps eliminate genetic errors that lead to birth defects.\n\nDr. Salk, a creative man himself, hopes that the institute will do its share in probing the wisdom of nature and thus help enlarge the wisdom of man. For the ultimate purpose of science, humanism and the arts, in his judgment, is the freeing of each individual to cultivate his full creativity, in whichever direction it leads. ... As if to prepare for Socratic encounters such as these, the institute's architect, [[Louis Kahn]], has installed blackboards in place of concrete facings on the walls along the walks.<ref name=Taubman/>|sign=|source=}}\n\n''The New York Times'', in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Salk vaccine, described the current workings at the facility:\n\n<blockquote>At the institute, a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, Dr. Salk holds the titles of founding director and resident fellow. His own laboratory group is concerned with the [[immunology|immunologic]] aspects of cancer and the mechanisms of autoimmune disease, such as [[multiple sclerosis]], in which the [[immune system]] attacks the body's own tissues.<ref name=NYT4-8-80>Glueck, Grace.

As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\"<ref name=Taubman>Taubman, Howard.

Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.\n\nSalk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, ''Man's Unfolding'', and ''The Survival of the Wisest''. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:\n\n<blockquote>I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. ... People think of [[biology]] in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. ... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.<ref name=NYT4-8-80/></blockquote>\n\nHis definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/openmind_ep1234 \"Man Evolving\"] video interview, 1985, 28 minutes</ref>\n\nJust prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled ''Millennium of the Mind''.\n\n==Personal life==\nThe day after his graduation from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. [[David Oshinsky]] writes that Donna's father, Elmer Lindsay, \"a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors.\" Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his \"rather pedestrian status\" by giving himself a middle name.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nThey had three children: Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan Salk.

During this upgrade, State Highway 1 from the end of the Southern Motorway to just north of Mercer was upgraded from two lanes to four, with grade separated interchanges constructed at Bombay and the junction with State Highway 2 just north of the township of [[Pokeno]]. A bypass of Pokeno was also constructed at this time, as well as several partially separated interchanges to allow access for local property owners along the route.<ref name=\"Auckland Motorways 2008\">{{cite web|title=Auckland Motorways 2008|url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/auckland-motorways/docs/2008.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangiriri to Ohinewai section was completed in 2003.

When completed, the expressway will form a 101.4&nbsp;km long continuous four-lane dual carriageway from the Bombay Hills to beyond the town of Cambridge, 24 kilometres south-east of Hamilton. Hamilton, as well as several other towns along the current route of State Highway 1  (such as [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Ngaruawahia]] and Cambridge), will be completely bypassed by the expressway, allowing through traffic to move much more efficiently.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzta.govt.nz/network/projects/project.html?ID=63 |title=Waikato Expressway |work=[[NZ Transport Agency]] |date=2009|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhile not officially designated as the Waikato Expressway until the early 2000s, the upgrading of State Highway 1 from the Bombay Hills to Mercer from 1992 to 1993 can be considered to be the first step in the construction of the expressway. During this upgrade, State Highway 1 from the end of the Southern Motorway to just north of Mercer was upgraded from two lanes to four, with grade separated interchanges constructed at Bombay and the junction with State Highway 2 just north of the township of [[Pokeno]]. A bypass of Pokeno was also constructed at this time, as well as several partially separated interchanges to allow access for local property owners along the route.<ref name=\"Auckland Motorways 2008\">{{cite web|title=Auckland Motorways 2008|url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/auckland-motorways/docs/2008.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangiriri to Ohinewai section was completed in 2003.
