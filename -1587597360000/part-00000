School dances and athletic events were ended in 1959 by the Arlington County School Board after integration began. Athletic events were reinstated in 1961, but school dances were held privately for years afterwards. Hoffman-Boston Junior-Senior High School closed in 1964 and its students were placed in formerly all-white schools. By 1969, all Arlington high schools were desegregated. The only two schools to remain almost completely segregated were Drew Elementary School and Hoffman-Boston Elementary School. In the case ''John E. Hart et al. v. County School Board of Arlington County, Virginia'', parents of Drew Elementary School students sued the Arlington County School Board for further integration.

Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of [[monitoring control and surveillance]].

In 1957 British fisheries researchers [[Ray Beverton]] and [[Sidney Holt]] published a seminal work on [[North Sea]] commercial fisheries dynamics.<ref name=\"Beverton and Holt, 1957\">{{harvnb|Beverton|Holt|1957}}</ref> In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes.\n\nAfter some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. \"The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations\" expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Beverton|1992}}</ref> Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] was founded to set standards for [[sustainable fishing]].

In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fi/agreem/codecond/ficonde.asp Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries]</ref> agreed at a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [[FAO]] session in 1995. The [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitcher|Kalikoski|Pramod|2006}}</ref>\n\nInternational agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters. The desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the Law of the Sea, and ultimately to the treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). Concepts such as [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ, extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from a nation's coasts) allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries.\n\nOther situations need additional intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water, EEZ of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} are irrelevant.<!--why?--> International waters beyond {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} from shore require explicit agreements.\n\n[[Straddling stocks|Straddling fish stocks]], which [[Fish migration|migrate]] through more than one EEZ also present challenges. Here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring [[coastal states]] and fishing entities. Usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement|coordinating the management]] of that stock.\n\nUNCLOS does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas [[bottom trawling]] fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range. In November 2004 the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution on Fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law.\n\n==Management mechanisms==\nMany countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named \"[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]]\" or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their [[exclusive economic zones]].\nFour categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!!!Inputs!!Outputs\n|-\n|Indirect\n|Vessel licensing\n|Catching techniques\n|-\n|Direct\n|Limited entry\n|[[IFQ|Catch quota]] and technical regulation\n|}\n\nTechnical means may include:\n* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms\n* prohibiting nets\n* setting minimum mesh sizes\n* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical \"inputs\".<ref>Sustainable Fishery system, Charles, A.

The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.<ref name=\"ASSS 2005\"/>\n\n==Data quality==\nAccording to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is the absence of quality data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be effective.

It was initially a [[NOAA]] initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath \"revolutionized scientists\u2019 ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems\". Behind this lies two decades of development work by [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\n\n==Human factors==\nManaging fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|McConney|2004}}</ref> If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of fishermen, are of key importance, and need to be understood.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Hilborn |first=R |year=2007 |title=Managing fisheries is managing people: what has been learned? |journal=Fish and Fisheries |volume=8 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00263_2.x |pages=285\u2013296\n|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nManagement regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town's economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Elder|2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jentoft|first=Svein|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nEmpowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.<ref name=\"svein1\">{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries isn't possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nThis concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices.<ref name=\"svein1\"/> Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nEmpowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management.\n\n==Performance==\nThe [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of certain global [[fish stock]]s have been allowed to run down.  The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to [[Maximum sustainable yield|sustainably]] catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled ''[[The Sunken Billions|The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]]'', the world's [[fishing fleet]]s incur a \"$US 50 billion annual economic loss\" through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the [[World Bank]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), asserts that half the world's [[fishing fleet]] could be scrapped with no change in catch.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation\u2019s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Arnason|Kelleher|Willmann|2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the [[Cod fisheries#Collapse of the northern cod fishery|northern cod fisheries]]. More recently, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] produced a series of journalistic investigations called ''[[Looting the seas]]''.

In 1957 British fisheries researchers [[Ray Beverton]] and [[Sidney Holt]] published a seminal work on [[North Sea]] commercial fisheries dynamics.<ref name=\"Beverton and Holt, 1957\">{{harvnb|Beverton|Holt|1957}}</ref> In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes.\n\nAfter some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. \"The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations\" expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Beverton|1992}}</ref> Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] was founded to set standards for [[sustainable fishing]]. In 2010, the [[Aquaculture Stewardship Council]] was created to do the same for [[aquaculture]].\n\nA report by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based [[Environmental Defense Fund]] and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by  an extra amount of as much as $50 billion.<ref name=\"GlobalFisheries\">{{cite news|title=Prince Charles calls for greater sustainability in fisheries|url=http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=London Mercury|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150815/http://www.londonmercury.com/index.php/sid/223769121/scat/415361b06433ee08/ht/Prince-Charles-calls-for-greater-sustainability-in-fisheries|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Political objectives==\nAccording to the [[FAO]], fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives, ideally with transparent priorities.<ref name=\"FAOGuidebook\">{{cite book|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kevern L.|last2=Garcia|first2=Serge M.|title=A Fishery Manager's Guidebook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wIEtBDxOxZUC|page=91}}|date=22 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7085-7|pages=91\u2013}}</ref> Typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to:<ref name=Duzgunes/>\n* [[maximum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable biomass yield]]\n* [[optimum sustainable yield|maximize sustainable economic yield]]\n* secure and increase employment\n* secure protein production and food supplies\n* increase export income\n\nSuch political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management, since the objectives can conflict with each other.<ref name=Duzgunes>{{cite journal |last1=Erdogan |first1=Naciye |last2=Duzgunes |first2=Ertug |title=Fisheries Management in the Black Sea Countries |journal=Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |date=1 January 2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=181\u2013192 |url=http://www.trjfas.org/abstract.php?lang=en&id=608 }}</ref>\n\n==International objectives==\nFisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules. In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fi/agreem/codecond/ficonde.asp Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries]</ref> agreed at a meeting of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization [[FAO]] session in 1995. The [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitcher|Kalikoski|Pramod|2006}}</ref>\n\nInternational agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters. The desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the Law of the Sea, and ultimately to the treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). Concepts such as [[exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZ, extending {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from a nation's coasts) allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries.\n\nOther situations need additional intergovernmental coordination. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water, EEZ of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} are irrelevant.<!--why?--> International waters beyond {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} from shore require explicit agreements.\n\n[[Straddling stocks|Straddling fish stocks]], which [[Fish migration|migrate]] through more than one EEZ also present challenges. Here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring [[coastal states]] and fishing entities. Usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement|coordinating the management]] of that stock.\n\nUNCLOS does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed. Several new fisheries (such as high seas [[bottom trawling]] fisheries) are not (yet) subject to international agreement across their entire range. In November 2004 the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution on Fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law.\n\n==Management mechanisms==\nMany countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named \"[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]]\" or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their [[exclusive economic zones]].\nFour categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!!!Inputs!!Outputs\n|-\n|Indirect\n|Vessel licensing\n|Catching techniques\n|-\n|Direct\n|Limited entry\n|[[IFQ|Catch quota]] and technical regulation\n|}\n\nTechnical means may include:\n* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms\n* prohibiting nets\n* setting minimum mesh sizes\n* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical \"inputs\".<ref>Sustainable Fishery system, Charles, A.

He asserts that scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |title=Adkison advocates increased fisheries data gathering |access-date=14 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045411/http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |archive-date=11 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe most reliable source for summary statistics is the [[FAO]] Fisheries Department.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM Fishery statistics: Reliability and policy implications]</ref>\n\n==Ecopath==\n[[Ecopath]], with [[Ecosim]] (EwE), is an [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]]. It was initially a [[NOAA]] initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath \"revolutionized scientists\u2019 ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems\". Behind this lies two decades of development work by [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.\n\n==Human factors==\nManaging fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|McConney|2004}}</ref> If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of fishermen, are of key importance, and need to be understood.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Hilborn |first=R |year=2007 |title=Managing fisheries is managing people: what has been learned? |journal=Fish and Fisheries |volume=8 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00263_2.x |pages=285\u2013296\n|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nManagement regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town's economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Elder|2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jentoft|first=Svein|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nEmpowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.<ref name=\"svein1\">{{Cite journal|last=Svein|first=Jentoft|date=January 2004|title=Fisheries co-management as empowerment|url=|journal=Marine Policy|volume=29|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2004.01.003}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries isn't possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nThis concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices.<ref name=\"svein1\"/> Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management.<ref name=\"svein1\"/>\n\nEmpowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management.\n\n==Performance==\nThe [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of certain global [[fish stock]]s have been allowed to run down.  The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to [[Maximum sustainable yield|sustainably]] catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled ''[[The Sunken Billions|The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]]'', the world's [[fishing fleet]]s incur a \"$US 50 billion annual economic loss\" through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the [[World Bank]] and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), asserts that half the world's [[fishing fleet]] could be scrapped with no change in catch.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation\u2019s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Arnason|Kelleher|Willmann|2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the [[Cod fisheries#Collapse of the northern cod fishery|northern cod fisheries]]. More recently, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] produced a series of journalistic investigations called ''[[Looting the seas]]''. These detail investigations into the black market for [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]], the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the [[Chilean jack mackerel]].<ref>[http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas Looting the Seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304215856/http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/natural-resources/looting-seas |date=4 March 2012 }} ''iWatch News'', 17 March 2012.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Too many see alsos|date=October 2015}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Age class structure]]\n* [[Beverton\u2013Holt model]]\n* [[Community supported fishery]]\n* [[Fisheries Law Centre]]\n* [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing]]\n* [[International inspection pennant]]\n* [[List of harvested aquatic animals by weight]]\n* [[Marine conservation]]\n* [[Marine Protected Area]]\n* [[Marine Conservation Cambodia|MFMA implementation in Cambodia]]\n* [[Maximum sustainable yield]]\n* [[North Pacific Fishery Management Council]]\n* [[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]]\n* [[Sustainable fisheries]]\n* [[The Sunken Billions]]\n* [[The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat|The End of the Line]] \u2013 documentary\n* [[U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils]]\n* [[Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arnason |first1=R |last2=Kelleher |first2=K |last3=Willmann |first3=R |year=2008 |url=http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 |archive-url=https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100504080401/http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-04 |title=The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform'' |publisher=[[World Bank]] and [[FAO]] |isbn=978-0-8213-7790-1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Beverton\n | first = R.

Often called \"Freddie,\" he was born and raised in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Despite limited formal art training, he rose to prominence at Disney very quickly in the early thirties due to his great natural talent and the tremendous appeal of his drawings, which are still greatly admired by animators and animation fans.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and career beginnings===\nMoore was born in Los Angeles and is best known for being the resident specialist in the animation of [[Mickey Mouse]].  He is most notable for redesigning the character in 1938 for his landmark role in \"''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''\" in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', a look which remains Mickey's official look to this day. His animation of the earlier Mickey design was especially memorable in the 1938 short ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', the last significant appearance of the \"pie-eyed\" Mickey.\n\nMoore's other significant work at the studio included ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]'', on which he was the principal animator; animation supervision of the dwarfs in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; most of Lampwick in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (all of the poolroom scene and until halfway through his transformation to a donkey); and Timothy the mouse in ''[[Dumbo]]''. Lampwick, who had red hair and buck teeth, has been largely believed to be a self-caricaturization of Fred Moore, as he was responsible for much of the character's designs and scenes. Moore animated some scenes of the mice from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', some scenes of the oysters as well as some of the later scenes of the White Rabbit in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice In Wonderland]]'', and did the mermaids in the Mermaid Lagoon for ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n\nMoore was well-known around the studio for his drawings of innocently [[sexual attraction|sexy]], often [[nude]], [[women]], referred to as \"Freddie Moore Girls.\"  Some of his girl designs found their way into Disney films: for example, the [[centaur]]ettes in ''Fantasia'' and the teenage girls in the \"All the Cats Join In\" segment of ''[[Make Mine Music]]''. (In \"All The Cats Join In\", Moore personally animated the sequence at the beginning, when the girl answers the telephone and then quickly showers and dresses, through to her scene putting on lipstick in front of her mirror). Moore's enduring influence can also be seen in the design of Casey's daughters in the 1954 short \"Casey Bats Again\".  His [[good girl art]] remains iconic and influential.  A model sheet for Ariel in the 1989 Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' made specific distinctions between the design of that character and a \"Freddie Moore Girl.\"\n\nMoore's drawings and design style have come to epitomize the formative years of the studio in between [[Ub Iwerks]]' departure in 1930 and the ascension of the \"[[Nine Old Men]]\", after which studio design was dominated by animator [[Milt Kahl]], along with storyboard artist [[Bill Peet]], and later production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]]. During the 1930s, Moore, [[Art Babbitt]], [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], [[Bill Tytla]], and Ham Luske were the dominant Disney animators whose pioneering work culminated in 1937 with the breakthrough of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''.\n\nMoore was a close friend of fellow animators [[Ward Kimball]] and [[Walt Kelly]], though he apparently had a quieter and more reserved nature than either of them.  Many surviving gag drawings by Kelly from the period of ''Pinocchio'' show Kimball as the corrupt Lampwick, with boyish Moore as Pinocchio.  Moore and Kimball were also caricatured as song and dance men in the 1941 Mickey Mouse short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]''.  Moore makes a brief (and quiet) live-action appearance in the 1941 feature ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'', along with Kimball and animator [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]] during one of the studio tour sequences. Kimball has discussed surreptitiously performing some of Moore's Disney work when Moore was too inebriated to finish it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ |title=''Ward Kimball's Final Farewell'', Hogan's Alley #11 |access-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306095332/http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ |archive-date=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHe talked little about his family. His daughters were Sue Moore and Melinda Moore. Later on, his daughter Sue had married and had another daughter named Kelly Hall, who now resides in Tacoma, Washington, with her two children.  Melinda married and had two children; her son Christian resides in the Bay Area and her daughter Timothia resides in Los Angeles.\n\n===Brief departure and return to ''Disney''===\nFred Moore was briefly fired from Disney Studios in 1946 due to his alcoholism, and instead worked for [[Walter Lantz]], where he redesigned the character [[Woody Woodpecker]] during a two-year stint that ended with his return to Disney in 1948.\n\n===Accident and death===\nMoore was already at work animating the mermaids and the lost boys for ''Peter Pan'' when both he and his second wife, Virginia, were injured in a [[road accident|traffic accident]] early on the evening of Saturday, November 22, 1952, when their car was struck head-on while she made a U-turn on a rural highway through Big Tujunga Canyon near the Angeles National Forest.  The Moores were reportedly returning from a day spent watching a football game with fellow Disney artist [[Jack Kinney]]. Moore died the following day at St. Joseph's Hospital in [[Burbank, California]], located across the street from the Disney Studios, from a cerebral hemorrhage resulting from a concussion.

Often called \"Freddie,\" he was born and raised in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Despite limited formal art training, he rose to prominence at Disney very quickly in the early thirties due to his great natural talent and the tremendous appeal of his drawings, which are still greatly admired by animators and animation fans.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and career beginnings===\nMoore was born in Los Angeles and is best known for being the resident specialist in the animation of [[Mickey Mouse]].  He is most notable for redesigning the character in 1938 for his landmark role in \"''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''\" in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', a look which remains Mickey's official look to this day. His animation of the earlier Mickey design was especially memorable in the 1938 short ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', the last significant appearance of the \"pie-eyed\" Mickey.\n\nMoore's other significant work at the studio included ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]'', on which he was the principal animator; animation supervision of the dwarfs in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; most of Lampwick in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (all of the poolroom scene and until halfway through his transformation to a donkey); and Timothy the mouse in ''[[Dumbo]]''. Lampwick, who had red hair and buck teeth, has been largely believed to be a self-caricurtuzation of Fred Moore, as he was responsible for much of the character's designs and scenes. Moore animated some scenes of the mice from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', some scenes of the oysters as well as some of the later scenes of the White Rabbit in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice In Wonderland]]'', and did the mermaids in the Mermaid Lagoon for ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n\nMoore was well-known around the studio for his drawings of innocently [[sexual attraction|sexy]], often [[nude]], [[women]], referred to as \"Freddie Moore Girls.\"  Some of his girl designs found their way into Disney films: for example, the [[centaur]]ettes in ''Fantasia'' and the teenage girls in the \"All the Cats Join In\" segment of ''[[Make Mine Music]]''. (In \"All The Cats Join In\", Moore personally animated the sequence at the beginning, when the girl answers the telephone and then quickly showers and dresses, through to her scene putting on lipstick in front of her mirror). Moore's enduring influence can also be seen in the design of Casey's daughters in the 1954 short \"Casey Bats Again\".  His [[good girl art]] remains iconic and influential.  A model sheet for Ariel in the 1989 Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' made specific distinctions between the design of that character and a \"Freddie Moore Girl.\"\n\nMoore's drawings and design style have come to epitomize the formative years of the studio in between [[Ub Iwerks]]' departure in 1930 and the ascension of the \"[[Nine Old Men]]\", after which studio design was dominated by animator [[Milt Kahl]], along with storyboard artist [[Bill Peet]], and later production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]]. During the 1930s, Moore, [[Art Babbitt]], [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], [[Bill Tytla]], and Ham Luske were the dominant Disney animators whose pioneering work culminated in 1937 with the breakthrough of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''.\n\nMoore was a close friend of fellow animators [[Ward Kimball]] and [[Walt Kelly]], though he apparently had a quieter and more reserved nature than either of them.  Many surviving gag drawings by Kelly from the period of ''Pinocchio'' show Kimball as the corrupt Lampwick, with boyish Moore as Pinocchio.  Moore and Kimball were also caricatured as song and dance men in the 1941 Mickey Mouse short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]''.  Moore makes a brief (and quiet) live-action appearance in the 1941 feature ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'', along with Kimball and animator [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]] during one of the studio tour sequences. Kimball has discussed surreptitiously performing some of Moore's Disney work when Moore was too inebriated to finish it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ |title=''Ward Kimball's Final Farewell'', Hogan's Alley #11 |access-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306095332/http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ |archive-date=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHe talked little about his family. His daughters were Sue Moore and Melinda Moore. Later on, his daughter Sue had married and had another daughter named Kelly Hall, who now resides in Tacoma, Washington, with her two children.  Melinda married and had two children; her son Christian resides in the Bay Area and her daughter Timothia resides in Los Angeles.\n\n===Brief departure and return to ''Disney''===\nFred Moore was briefly fired from Disney Studios in 1946 due to his alcoholism, and instead worked for [[Walter Lantz]], where he redesigned the character [[Woody Woodpecker]] during a two-year stint that ended with his return to Disney in 1948.\n\n===Accident and death===\nMoore was already at work animating the mermaids and the lost boys for ''Peter Pan'' when both he and his second wife, Virginia, were injured in a [[road accident|traffic accident]] early on the evening of Saturday, November 22, 1952, when their car was struck head-on while she made a U-turn on a rural highway through Big Tujunga Canyon near the Angeles National Forest.  The Moores were reportedly returning from a day spent watching a football game with fellow Disney artist [[Jack Kinney]]. Moore died the following day at St. Joseph's Hospital in [[Burbank, California]], located across the street from the Disney Studios, from a cerebral hemorrhage resulting from a concussion.  Moore is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]] in a plot overlooking the Disney Studios.\n\nFred Moore was posthumously inducted as a [[Disney Legend]] by the studio in 1995, and posthumously received the animation industry's Winsor McCay Award in 1983.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
