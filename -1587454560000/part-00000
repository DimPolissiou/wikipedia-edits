The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what have we done to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don't need to because we are already there.\"<ref name=\"federalnewsradio.com\"/>\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the NMCI contract ended and the new Continuity of Services Contract (COSC) began. The COSC gives the Navy and Marine Corps the best of the current NMCI IT environment while driving operations continuity, cost savings, network control, competition and contract management.  Under the COSC, the Navy retains the same scope of NMCI services with [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], but the network becomes a government-owned, contractor-supported, managed services environment.<ref>[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100708xa.html U.S. Department of the Navy Signs Enterprise Information Technology Services Contract with HP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThis is a paradigm shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program.<ref>[https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/5231.3A.pdf Department Of The Navy Letterhead<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as [[SIPRnet|classified]] connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per-seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops as well as other network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nNMCI is the first large-scale federal government IT centralization and outsourcing project. Its lessons have informed other government agency efforts to consolidate and outsource IT services.  According to industry analyst Warren Suss of Suss consulting, \"In the long run, government agencies will come to see the need for similar types of solutions, and I think they'll look to NMCI for lessons learned.\"<ref>[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_32/news/103696-1.html Love/hate relationship with NMCI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe NMCI program is managed by the Navy's [[Project management office|Program Executive Office\u2013Enterprise Information Systems]] (PEO-EIS).\n\n==History==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to have no discussion of developments since 2006|date=April 2018}}\nOn 6 October 2000, the NMCI contract was awarded to [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS), now [[HP Enterprise Services]] (HP).<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/051308-hp-buys-eds-for-139.html HP buys EDS for $13.9 billion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Secretary of the Navy Gordon England summed up the Navy's IT Environment prior to the commencement of NMCI: \u201cWe basically had 28 separate commands budgeting, developing, licensing, and operating IT autonomously.

The tool helps provide enhanced situational awareness via increased information sharing and collaboration to commanders by giving them a common picture of network performance.  Commanders can see scheduled maintenance tasks and other issues impacting the network, giving them the option to defer work that might affect the flow of critical information from the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=4064703 U.S. Navy expands network alert effort \u2013 C4ISRJournal.com \u2013 Military Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWork in 2008 has increased NMCI's ability to respond to security issues and the program was the first network to implement fully the Department of Defense information assurance standards in both classified and unclassified environments. Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense content filtering, an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, \"Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content.\"<ref name=\"navy.mil\">[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36432 Information Assurance is Top Priority at Kings Bay<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Navy, Websense enables users to block or unblock sites, based on emerging and/or dynamic threats. The NMCI blocking policy is determined by various operational commands, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, and enforced by the Global Network Operations Center, based in Norfolk.  Blocked sites are redirected to a notification page which then links to a page on NMCI's homeport Web site. On this site, a user can submit a request that a site be unblocked in order to support mission requirements.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nIn addition, NMCI is upgrading existing servers with Bluecoat proxy servers, which provides better capacity and traffic management functions. According to NMCI's own data, a few users account for the majority of NMCI's bandwidth usage, mostly attributed to streaming internet radio and video. New servers will allow bandwidth usage monitoring, down to a command or user level.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nThe security upgrades have been well received by the Navy. On 31 March 2009, Rear Admiral (Ret.) John A. Gauss, Acquisition Director for the NGEN System Program Office (SPO) said during a press conference that \"NMCI is the most secure network within the Navy.\"<ref>[http://thepacketrat.com/ The Packet Rat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Navy and HP measure end-user satisfaction through a series of quarterly satisfaction surveys.  End user satisfaction has steadily improved, reaching a high of nearly 86% in February 2008, as compared to 80% in December 2006. This is largely due to the upgrade of nearly 112,000 desktop and laptop computers in 2007, and a combination of network enhancements that are improving speed and reliability.

Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense content filtering, an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, \"Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content.\"<ref name=\"navy.mil\">[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36432 Information Assurance is Top Priority at Kings Bay<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Navy, Websense enables users to block or unblock sites, based on emerging and/or dynamic threats. The NMCI blocking policy is determined by various operational commands, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, and enforced by the Global Network Operations Center, based in Norfolk.  Blocked sites are redirected to a notification page which then links to a page on NMCI's homeport Web site. On this site, a user can submit a request that a site be unblocked in order to support mission requirements.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nIn addition, NMCI is upgrading existing servers with Bluecoat proxy servers, which provides better capacity and traffic management functions. According to NMCI's own data, a few users account for the majority of NMCI's bandwidth usage, mostly attributed to streaming internet radio and video. New servers will allow bandwidth usage monitoring, down to a command or user level.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nThe security upgrades have been well received by the Navy. On 31 March 2009, Rear Admiral (Ret.) John A. Gauss, Acquisition Director for the NGEN System Program Office (SPO) said during a press conference that \"NMCI is the most secure network within the Navy.\"<ref>[http://thepacketrat.com/ The Packet Rat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Navy and HP measure end-user satisfaction through a series of quarterly satisfaction surveys.

So, I see a lot of good things with NMCI.\"<ref name=Governance/>\n\nNMCI works today{{when|date=April 2018}} and it continues to improve as user needs evolve and technology opportunities arise. During the final two years{{when|date=April 2018}} of the contract, technology initiatives included new hardware, applications, and services to support the Navy and Marine Corps' advanced IT needs. HP will install more than 110,000 new laptops and desktops, and will push more upgrades to improve end-users' IT capabilities through upgraded machine capacity, new operating systems, and new service lines.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Today{{when|date=April 2018}}==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2011 as \"today\" without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nThe Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office, in collaboration with NMCI partner HP, which manages the CoSC program, is deploying a number of new Navy initiatives, including:\n \nTablet laptops for Navy recruiters\n* The NRC began rolling out Hewlett-Packard (HP) Elitebook 2740p Tablets to recruiters in early September 2011.\nHosted Virtual Desktop (HVD) capability\n* Thin-client HVDs using network storage will replace bulkier traditional workstations.\nExpanded support for smartcards\n* [[Two-factor authentication]] using a SIPRNET smartcard token will be used to confirm the identity of NMCI users.\nEnterprise-wide operating system upgrade and improved end-user hardware delivery times\n* New five-day seat deployment initiative aims to speed up the delivery time of new workstations.<ref>{{cite web|title=NMCI Continues to Provide Solutions for Sailors and Marines|url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=3572|work=CHIPS Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Next Steps for NMCI==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss plans in 2009 without discussing what happened later.|date=April 2018}}\nOn 31 March 2009, the Department of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare System Command announced its intention to negotiate a Continuity of Service Contract (COSC) that would allow HP to continue to provide IT services during the transition from the existing contract (NMCI) to the proposed next contract, known as Next Generation Enterprise Network Solution (NGEN).\n\nUnder the new contract, HP will continue NMCI services, support the transition to NGEN (which includes various engineering services), and give the Navy licenses for the network's operations and infrastructure.  A chief goal of the new contract is to ensure that the network remains up-and-running while the Navy pursues the goals of NGEN.\n\nAs Rear Admiral John Goodwin, assistant chief of naval operations of NGEN notes, \"My responsibilities are to synchronize the efforts of the operations, the policy, the programming, the resources and the acquisition piece,\" Goodwin said.<ref>http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/04/06/NMCI-NGEN.aspx</ref</ref>\n\n==Network Security, Functionality vs. Users\u2019 Permissions, Expectations==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2007 without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nIn November 2007, a quarterly user satisfaction rating between both the United States Marine Corps. and the United States Navy revealed that 83.8 percent of the military members who submitted the survey said that NMCI was satisfactory.  Some of the 17 percent who were not satisfied were vocal in their disapproval.<ref>[http://gcn.com/articles/2007/12/07/nmci-aye-aye.aspx?sc_lang=en NMCI?

Senior officers said they enacted the worldwide ban on these types of sites out of concern that the rapidly increasing use of these sites threatened to overwhelm the military's private Internet network and risk the disclosure of combat-sensitive material.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/14/AR2007051400112.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Alan | last1=Sipress | first2=Sam | last2=Diaz | title=A Casualty of War: MySpace | date=15 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nNMCI's (per DoD requirements) need for security results in longer boot-up times for computers on the network than on non-network computers.  HP claims to be accelerating its technology refresh activities which include deploying new, faster computers which should improve performance while maintaining tight security.\n\nThough technical support has improved dramatically, and though HP's help desk earned high praise from many survey respondents in 2007, some NMCI users felt that their wait times were excessive when they called the help desk.  Further, because NMCI's first priority was to rein in the counterproductive customization and proliferation of applications and networks,<ref>See footnote 7: MAg.com reports \"NMCI consolidated 8,000 applications to 500 in four years and 15,003 logistics and readiness systems to 2,759 over a two-year period\" http://www.softwaremag.com/L.cfm?Doc=1100-12/2007</ref> users are not given permissions to change computers\u2019 settings.  Some servicemen and women are unhappy with the fact that they are not given permission to administer the system from the user level.\n\nNMCI requires that only network administrators perform all maintenance and support to ensure uniform security and capabilities across the network.  Some users find that requirement cumbersome and claim that wait times to resolve even the smallest of issues are too long.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nDespite early challenges, NMCI will be the foundation on which the Navy and Marine Corps can build to support their broader strategic information management objectives.<ref>Military Information Technology reports that \"Navy officials envision that NGEN will be a follow on to NMCI, possibly with the addition of other networks.\" http://www.military-information-technology.com/article.cfm?DocID=2324</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nmciinfo.usmc.mil/ Official USMC NMCI site]\n* [https://www.homeport.navy.mil/ NMCI Homeport] (smart card required)\n* [http://enterprise.spawar.navy.mil/body.cfm?type=c&category=28&subcat=62 Official Navy PEO EIS Web site]\n* [http://h30423.www3.hp.com/index.jsp?fr_story=5db3972d51a33e9b7c7c1fd7e21058659f84daeb&rf=bm Official Video: NMCI Success, an HP story]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Navy Marine Corps Intranet}}\n[[Category:United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps]]\n", "name_user": "Nickelpro", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Marine_Corps_Intranet"}

He began the study of [[Kyokushin kaikan|Kyokushin karate]] as a [[student]] in [[high school]] at the headquarters ([[honbu]]) of Kyokushin Kaikan at [[Ikebukuro]], [[Tokyo]], where founder [[Masutatsu \u014cyama]] taught.  Yamazaki practiced with the senior pupils who were [[jp:\u5927\u5c71\u8302 (\u7a7a\u624b\u5bb6)|Shigeru \u014cyama]], [[jp:\u5927\u5c71\u6cf0\u5f66|Yasuhiko \u014cyama]] (both from [[jp:\u56fd\u969b\u5927\u5c71\u7a7a\u624b\u9053\u9023\u76df|The World \u014cyama Karate]] in the [[United States]] - Shigeru is S\u014dshu and Yasuhiko is Saik\u014d [[Shihan]]), [[Tadashi Nakamura (martial artist)|Tadashi Nakamura]] and [[Hideyuki Ashihara]] at the time.\n\nFor two and a half years Yamazaki commuted three hours from his house to the [[dojo]], and reached the rank of [[Shodan (rank)|shodan]] (1st degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]) on April 15, 1967.<ref name=\"iko-dan\">{{cite journal \n|title=International Karate Organization KYOKUSHINKAIKAN Domestic Black Belt List As of Oct.2000 \n|journal=Kyokushin karate s\u014dkan : shin seishin shugi eno s\u014dseiki e (\u6975\u771f\u30ab\u30e9\u30c6\u7dcf\u9451 \uff1a \u65b0\u30fb\u7cbe\u795e\u4e3b\u7fa9\u3078\u306e\u5275\u4e16\u7d00\u3078) \n|publisher=Aik\u0113\u014dshuppanjigy\u014dkyoku (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793eI.K.O.\u51fa\u7248\u4e8b\u52d9\u5c40)\n|year=2001 \n|volume= \n|issue= \n|pages=62\u201364\n|isbn = 4-8164-1250-6}}\n</ref>  This was an unusually short time period of only two years because of his level of talent and effort.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/> He reached the rank of [[Dan rank#List of common ranks in Japanese|nidan]] (2nd degree black belt) on October 10, 1967.<ref name=\"iko-dan\"/>\n\nYamazaki instructed pupils of novice, intermediate and advanced levels at the headquarters of Kyokushin and the [[U.S. Army]] [[Camp Zama]] besides his own practice. He later said that it was good experience for him to instruct at Camp Zama as the pupils of the U.S. Army were larger than Japanese fighters. Several pupils measured over 200 centimeters in height and weighed over 90 kilograms, and practicing with these students led him to develop new ways to fight and knock out larger opponents.<ref name=\"1997dec232435364041\"/>\n\n===Kickboxing career===\nTelevised [[kickboxing]] was a huge boom from 1965 to 1975 when it was broadcast on the four TV stations, [[jp:\u6771\u6771\u4eac\u653e\u9001\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9|TBS]], [[Nippon Television]], [[TV Asahi]] and [[TV Tokyo]] all over [[Japan]]. TV Asahi requested a player from Kyokushin in February, 1969, and [[Masutatsu \u014cyama]] elected Yamazaki and [[Yoshiji Soeno]] to enter the competitions. \u014cyama also founded a kickboxing gym called ''Kyokushin Gym'' where they practiced kickboxing about two months before entering the kickboxing competitions in April, 1969. Yamazaki fought in the [[lightweight]] or [[welterweight]] division at kickboxing.\n\nAt the first competition, Soeno fought Kannanpai who was one of the strongest boxers of [[Muay Thai]] and had won over [[Tadashi Sawamura]] a half a year before their match. Soeno was defeated by Kannanpai, and the next match was Yamazaki and Kannanpai. Yamazaki gained a knock out win over Kannanpai with a right [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] [[Punch (combat)|punch]] in the first round.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref>''[[Nikkan Sports]]'' of morning newspaper, June 14, 1969.</ref> Also one of the strongest boxers of Muai Thai with knockout wins over Sawamura was Samanso from [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium|Lumpinee-ranked boxers]]. Samanso got knocked downs sixteen times from Sawamura, but Yamazaki fought and also knocked out Samanso in the first round.<ref>''GONKAKU Remix CROSS TALK BATTLE Vol.1'', p. 188\u2013191, Nippon Sports Publishing co.,Ltd, July, 2003.</ref><ref name=\"ful1995nov\">''Fullcontact KARATE'', pp. 48\u201352, fukushodo, November, 1995.</ref>\n\nAfter these fights, Yamazaki wanted to learn Muay Thai because it is a strong and technical [[martial arts|martial art]]. He was able to learn Muay Thai from the coach and the boxers at the matches. As his Muai Thai techniques improved, especially his [[front kick]], [[roundhouse kick]], [[elbow]] and [[knee (strike)]], he included these techniques in his [[karate]] training.\n\nThe kickboxing promoters wanted to keep Yamazaki at kickboxing because Yamazaki was a strong and good-looking fighter, and he had been very popular.<ref name=\"sat\u014dkarate1987\"/><ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/> The promoters presented Yamazaki with good contract terms, but Yamazaki refused the offer, responding that he had never fought martial arts for the money. It was the life style of [[bushido]] that matters to his thinking. Many offers and persuasions came again and again, and finally he signed to participate in kickboxing matches.<ref name=\"1997dec232435364041\"/> But TV Asahi stopped broadcasting kickboxing, and he returned to karate after only one year.<ref name=\"Katabutu1999\"/> He fought ten kickboxing matches with a record of eight knock out wins and two losses (two lost on a decision).<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"1997dec232435364041\"/>\n\n===Full Contact Karate Open Championships career===\nKyokushin was planning to hold the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships at the [[Tokyo]] Metropolitan Gymnasium in September 1969. It was not only a karate [[championship]], but [[martial artists]] of various kinds also participated in this competition.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"TakagiWagashi\"/> Athletes included Gidon Gaddary who was an [[Israel]]i [[judo]] player weighing over 100 kilograms; Paul Jackson who was a [[heavyweight]] [[Boxing|boxer]] from the [[United States]]; and three [[Muay Thai]] boxers from [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium|Lumpinee-ranked boxers]] including Birahon, Sakao and Samanso.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"TakagiWagashi\"/> The competition was fighting against other combative arts. The rules were simple: It was a foul to use a hand or elbow to the face and to attack a man's vital point. The players didn't use any protection. They fought using bare hands, bare knees and bare legs.\n\nBefore the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, Yamazaki had thought that he had to win this championships at any cost. If he did not become a [[champion]] at the All-Japan Open Championships, Kyokushin would end there when Yamazaki or Soeno of the Kyokushin's [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] were defeated by another style of karate fighters or other martial artists.<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> Yamazaki admitted that the mental pressure was considerable, but he dealt with the pressures. He fought six matches and won five by [[ippon]] (knock out) and one by judgment at this championships tournament, and thus became the first champion of the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships.<ref name=\"sat\u014dkarate1987\"/><ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/><ref>{{cite journal \n|title=WORLD KARATE (\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u7a7a\u624b)\n|date=Jan 2010 \n|journal=IKO Management (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30a2\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8)\n|volume=6 \n|issue=1 \n|page=96\n}}</ref>\n\nYamazaki also participated in the Second, Fourth and Fifth All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, winning 2nd place, 4th place and 2nd place, respectively.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/> His karate training had decreased because he graduated [[university]] and began to work as a [[television producer]] after the Second All-Japan Open Championships.

R\u014dyama was a specialist in low [[roundhouse kick]]s and he had practiced extensively before this championship. Although Yamazaki was under-trained, the match was almost even, and R\u014dyama's won only on a decision. The finals was one of the best matches ever at Kyokushin, and the story passed into history down from generation to generation.<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> All concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media said \"Yamazaki is a genius\" at what he does.<ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/>\n\nThough Yamazaki tried to make time to practice karate while doing television production work, it was very difficult for him to continue training for the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships. He made a deliberate decision to retire from the All-Japan Open Championships and reported it to Masutatsu \u014cyama after the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships. Yamazaki left a steady record of wins in all of the All-Japan Open Championships in which he participated.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/> Yamazaki said \u201cI don't do professional karate.

Most of his fame came from [[kickboxing]], and there was much demand for him to open a school of karate. Yamazaki consulted with [[Masutatsu \u014cyama]] and \u014cyama obtained clearance for Yamazaki to open a karate [[dojo]] at [[\u014cmiya-ku, Saitama|\u014cmiya]] in 1977. The dojo was managed by volunteers because Yamazaki did not wish to earn money by professional karate. For this reason, the dojo was not called Kyokushin but instead [[Fuurinkazan]] (\u98a8\u6797\u706b\u5c71) from his hometown hero [[Shingen Takeda]]. He established a Fuurinnkazan or [[nonprofit organization]] called International Budo Karate Organization Gyakushin-Kai (\u9006\u771f\u4f1a\u9928) in 1995. He continues to manage this organization.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/>\n\n== Profile ==\n\n=== Fighting ===\nYamazaki was skilled in advanced techniques and very strong and fast at the basic techniques of [[front kick]], [[roundhouse kick]] and [[knee (strike)|knee]], as well as the [[elbow]] and the [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] [[Punch (combat)|punch]] ([[gyaku zuki]]).<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/><ref name=\"championsfight\">[[Yasuhiko \u014cyama]]:''The Champions' Fights-[[Kyokushin Kaikan]]\u30fb[[K-1]]\u30fb[[The World \u014cyama Karate|USA \u014cyama]]'', pp. 11\u201323, [[Bookman Inc.]], 1998.</ref> These techniques were refined by him because he integrated [[karate]] and [[Muay Thai]].<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> Yamazaki used his elbows and knees to defend himself.<ref name=\"gpk481989\"/> Pupils or fighters who did [[kumite]] or fought with him said \"We always hurt our hands and legs. Yamazaki has a technique which means defense is offense.\"<ref name=\"championsfight\"/><ref name=\"gpk481989\"/><ref name=\"masandstrong1995\"/><ref name=\"Kitanoguchi,F page75-80\"/>\n\n===Expert breaking===\nYamazaki was not only an expert at [[kumite]], but also an expert at [[Breaking (martial arts)|breaking]]. All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships and World Full Contact Karate Open Championships included a breaking competition as well as kumite, with players required to demonstrate breaking of cryptomeria boards. The challenge was to break the boards with bare hands, bare [[Elbow-joint|elbows]] and bare legs. Competitors could use four types of technique: punching (\u201c[[tsuki]]\"), [[kick]]ing (\u201ckeri\"),\u3000[[knifehand strike]], and [[elbow]]. The winner was decided by the total number of broken cryptomeria boards. Yamazaki broke four boards by punching, seven by kicking, six by knifehand strike and seven by elbow with a total of 24, and won the breaking championship at the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships in 1973.\n\nThis record was not broken for a while, but it was exceeded in total breaking and reached a new height with [[jp:\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2\u30e0\u30b9 (\u683c\u95d8\u5bb6)|Willie Williams]], a karateka from the [[United States]], at the Second World Full Contact Karate Open Championships in 1979.  He broke five boards by punching, six by kicking, eight by knifehand strike, and seven by elbow with a total of 26. Williams won 3rd place in kumite, as well. However, all concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media pointed out that Williams was 196 centimeters in height and 100 kilogram in weight, while Yamazaki was 177 centimeters in height and 62 kilograms in weight with a difference of almost 40 kilograms, while the number of the broken boards was only different by two. Yamazaki proved his skill and talent eminently.<ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/><ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/>\n\n=== Teaching ===\nYamazaki was not only a strong fighter but also became a respected teacher.

He later said that it was good experience for him to instruct at Camp Zama as the pupils of the U.S. Army were larger than Japanese fighters.

Yamazaki fought in the [[lightweight]] or [[welterweight]] division at kickboxing.\n\nAt the first competition, Soeno fought Kannanpai who was one of the strongest boxers of [[Muay Thai]] and had won over [[Tadashi Sawamura]] a half a year before their match. Soeno was defeated by Kannanpai, and the next match was Yamazaki and Kannanpai.

He was able to learn Muay Thai from the coach and the boxers at the matches. As his Muai Thai techniques improved, especially his [[front kick]], [[roundhouse kick]], [[elbow]] and [[knee (strike)]], he included these techniques in his [[karate]] training.\n\nThe kickboxing promoters wanted to keep Yamazaki at kickboxing because Yamazaki was a strong and good-looking fighter, and he had been very popular.<ref name=\"sat\u014dkarate1987\"/><ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/> The promoters presented Yamazaki with good contract terms, but Yamazaki refused the offer, responding that he had never fought martial arts for the money. It was the life style of [[bushido]] that matters to his thinking. Many offers and persuasions came again and again, and finally he signed to participate in kickboxing matches.<ref name=\"1997dec232435364041\"/> But TV Asahi stopped broadcasting kickboxing, and he returned to karate after only one year.<ref name=\"Katabutu1999\"/> He fought ten kickboxing matches with a record of eight knock out wins and two losses (two lost on a decision).<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"1997dec232435364041\"/>\n\n===Full Contact Karate Open Championships career===\nKyokushin was planning to hold the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships at the [[Tokyo]] Metropolitan Gymnasium in September 1969. It was not only a karate [[championship]], but [[martial artists]] of various kinds also participated in this competition.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"TakagiWagashi\"/> Athletes included Gidon Gaddary who was an [[Israel]]i [[judo]] player weighing over 100 kilograms; Paul Jackson who was a [[heavyweight]] [[Boxing|boxer]] from the [[United States]]; and three [[Muay Thai]] boxers from [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium|Lumpinee-ranked boxers]] including Birahon, Sakao and Samanso.<ref name=\"Fullcontact KARATE Oct1995\"/><ref name=\"TakagiWagashi\"/> The competition was fighting against other combative arts. The rules were simple: It was a foul to use a hand or elbow to the face and to attack a man's vital point. The players didn't use any protection. They fought using bare hands, bare knees and bare legs.\n\nBefore the First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, Yamazaki had thought that he had to win this championships at any cost. If he did not become a [[champion]] at the All-Japan Open Championships, Kyokushin would end there when Yamazaki or Soeno of the Kyokushin's [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] were defeated by another style of karate fighters or other martial artists.<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> Yamazaki admitted that the mental pressure was considerable, but he dealt with the pressures. He fought six matches and won five by [[ippon]] (knock out) and one by judgment at this championships tournament, and thus became the first champion of the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships.<ref name=\"sat\u014dkarate1987\"/><ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/><ref>{{cite journal \n|title=WORLD KARATE (\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u7a7a\u624b)\n|date=Jan 2010 \n|journal=IKO Management (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30a2\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8)\n|volume=6 \n|issue=1 \n|page=96\n}}</ref>\n\nYamazaki also participated in the Second, Fourth and Fifth All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships, winning 2nd place, 4th place and 2nd place, respectively.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/> His karate training had decreased because he graduated [[university]] and began to work as a [[television producer]] after the Second All-Japan Open Championships.

R\u014dyama was a specialist in low [[roundhouse kick]]s and he had practiced extensively before this championship. Although Yamazaki was under-trained, the match was almost even, and R\u014dyama's won only on a decision. The finals was one of the best matches ever at Kyokushin, and the story passed into history down from generation to generation.<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> All concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media said \"Yamazaki is a genius\" at what he does.<ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/>\n\nThough Yamazaki tried to make time to practice karate while doing television production work, it was very difficult for him to continue training for the All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships. He made a deliberate decision to retire from the All-Japan Open Championships and reported it to Masutatsu \u014cyama after the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships. Yamazaki left a steady record of wins in all of the All-Japan Open Championships in which he participated.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/> Yamazaki said \u201cI don't do professional karate. I think that makes [[martial arts]] dirty. It was good for me only in the Spirit of Kyokushin that had been cultivated for years.\u201d<ref name=\"Shit\u014d\">{{cite journal \n|title=Kyokushin Karate Shit\u014d!

Most of his fame came from [[kickboxing]], and there was much demand for him to open a school of karate. Yamazaki consulted with [[Masutatsu \u014cyama]] and \u014cyama obtained clearance for Yamazaki to open a karate [[dojo]] at [[\u014cmiya-ku, Saitama|\u014cmiya]] in 1977. The dojo was managed by volunteers because Yamazaki did not wish to earn money by professional karate. For this reason, the dojo was not called Kyokushin but instead [[Fuurinkazan]] (\u98a8\u6797\u706b\u5c71) from his hometown hero [[Shingen Takeda]]. He established a Fuurinnkazan or [[nonprofit organization]] called International Budo Karate Organization Gyakushin-Kai (\u9006\u771f\u4f1a\u9928) in 1995. He continues to manage this organization.<ref name=\"ful1995nov\"/>\n\n== Profile ==\n\n=== Fighting ===\nYamazaki was skilled in advanced techniques and very strong and fast at the basic techniques of [[front kick]], [[roundhouse kick]] and [[knee (strike)|knee]], as well as the [[elbow]] and the [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] [[Punch (combat)|punch]] ([[gyaku zuki]]).<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/><ref name=\"championsfight\">[[Yasuhiko \u014cyama]]:''The Champions' Fights-[[Kyokushin Kaikan]]\u30fb[[K-1]]\u30fb[[The World \u014cyama Karate|USA \u014cyama]]'', pp. 11\u201323, [[Bookman Inc.]], 1998.</ref> These techniques were refined by him because he integrated [[karate]] and [[Muay Thai]].<ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/> Yamazaki used his elbows and knees to defend himself.<ref name=\"gpk481989\"/> Pupils or fighters who did [[kumite]] or fought with him said \"We always hurt our hands and legs. Yamazaki has a technique which means defense is offense.\"<ref name=\"championsfight\"/><ref name=\"gpk481989\"/><ref name=\"masandstrong1995\"/><ref name=\"Kitanoguchi,F page75-80\"/>\n\n===Expert breaking===\nYamazaki was not only an expert at [[kumite]], but also an expert at [[Breaking (martial arts)|breaking]]. All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships and World Full Contact Karate Open Champtionships included a breaking competition as well as kumite, with players required to demonstrate breaking of cryptomeria boards. The challenge was to break the boards with bare hands, bare [[Elbow-joint|elbows]] and bare legs. Competitors could use four types of technique: punching (\u201c[[tsuki]]\"), [[kick]]ing (\u201ckeri\"),\u3000[[knifehand strike]], and [[elbow]]. The winner was decided by the total number of broken cryptomeria boards. Yamazaki broke four boards by punching, seven by kicking, six by knifehand strike and seven by elbow with a total of 24, and won the breaking championship at the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships in 1973.\n\nThis record was not broken for a while, but it was exceeded in total breaking and reached a new height with [[jp:\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2\u30e0\u30b9 (\u683c\u95d8\u5bb6)|Willie Williams]], a karateka from the [[United States]], at the Second World Full Contact Karate Open Championships in 1979.  He broke five boards by punching, six by kicking, eight by knifehand strike, and seven by elbow with a total of 26. Williams won 3rd place in kumite, as well. However, all concerned in Kyokushin and the mass media pointed out that Williams was 196 centimeters in height and 100 kilogram in weight, while Yamazaki was 177 centimeters in height and 62 kilograms in weight with a difference of almost 40 kilograms, while the number of the broken boards was only different by two. Yamazaki proved his skill and talent eminently.<ref name=\"gong4447nihon5255\"/><ref name=\"fullconkara6815fuku1994\"/>\n\n=== Teaching ===\nYamazaki was not only a strong fighter but also became a respected teacher.

Shigeru was the Saik\u014d-[[shihan]] (the top instructor) of Kyokushin at that time. Shigeru talked about when Yamazaki practiced with Shigeru's pupils. \"My pupils were very surprised to see Yamazaki's [[Stand-up fighting|fighting]]. His footwork is sharp and light. All of his techniques are fast, containing a lot of destructive power, and they thought it looked very fine.
