{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

(2010). Wyoming Range War: The Infamous Invasion of Johnson County. Norman, Oklahoma: [[University of Oklahoma Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4106-0}}.</ref> He is celebrated for his heroic stand in his besieged cabin and for a heartfelt letter written at the time describing the events.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n{{expand section|date=August 2012}}\nNate Champion was born 29 September 1857 in [[Leander, Texas]]. His parents were John and Naomi Champion. One of eighteen brothers and sisters, he grew up in the [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]] area. His father served as sheriff of [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]] for while his Aunt Hattie Cluck drove her own cattle to market in [[Abilene, Kansas]] in 1871. With the money she and her husband George purchased the land that would become Cedar Park. Like most footloose cowboys of that area he worked his way north to Wyoming where he worked for several ranches before building his own spread.\n\n===The Johnson County War===\nThe dramatic events of 1892 took place against a background of violent conflict over land use that stretched from 1889 to 1909. Historian Richard Maxwell Brown refers to the events in Wyoming as part of a wider \"Western Civil War of Incorporation.\"\n\nIn the early days in [[Wyoming]], most of the land was in the public domain, open both to stockraising as [[open range]] and to [[Homestead Act|homesteading]]. Large numbers of [[cattle]] were turned loose on the open range by large [[ranching|ranches]], sometimes financed by other investors. In the spring a roundup was held and the cows and the calves belonging to each ranch were separated and the calves branded. Before the roundup, sometimes calves, especially orphan or stray calves, were surreptitiously branded, and thus taken. The large ranches, concerned about this practice, forbade their employees from owning cattle and aggressively defended against [[rustling]].\n\nThe situation became steadily worse after the poor winter of 1886. The large companies began to aggressively appropriate land and control the flow and supply of water in this area; they justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling, and vigorously sought to exclude the smaller ranchers from participation in the annual roundup; apparently agents of the larger ranches killed several alleged rustlers. A number of [[lynching]]s of alleged rustlers took place in 1889, including the double lynching of innocent homesteaders and ranchers [[Cattle Kate|Ella Watson]] and [[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averell]].<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\nThe large ranches were organized as the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] (the WSGA) and gathered socially as the [[Cheyenne Club]] in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. In April 1892 the WSGA hired killers from [[Texas]]; an expedition of 50 men was organized, which proceeded by train from Cheyenne to [[Casper, Wyoming]], then toward Johnson County, intending to eliminate alleged rustlers and also, apparently, to replace the government in Johnson County. Major [[Frank Wolcott]] led the Regulators into Johnson County. To prevent an alarm, the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines out of [[Buffalo, Wyoming|Buffalo]] were cut. The expedition was accompanied by two [[newspaper]] [[reporter]]s whose lurid accounts later appeared in the eastern newspapers.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n===Attack on Champion===\nThe first target of the WSGA was Nate Champion at the \"KC Ranch\". Champion was a small rancher who was active in the efforts of small ranchers to organize a competing roundup. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men, evidently trappers, who had taken shelter for the night, were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin and died a few hours later. The fourth, Nate Champion, was besieged. Two passers-by noticed the ruckus and rode to Buffalo, where Johnson County [[Sheriff]] William \"Red\" Angus raised a [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|posse]] of 200 men and set out for the \"KC Ranch\".<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/> \n\nChampion held out for several hours, killing at least four of the [[vigilante]]s, and wounding several others. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. \"Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once.\" he wrote. The last journal entry read: \"Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again.\"<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\nWith the house on fire, Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put the journal in his pocket before he emerged, running from the back door with a Colt revolver in the left hand and a Winchester rifle in the right. He was gunned down by four men firing simultaneously, hit by 28 bullets. The invaders later pinned a note on Champion's bullet-riddled chest that read \"Cattle Thieves Beware\". They also  carefully removed entries from the diary which named some of the attackers.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n===Aftermath of death===\nThe following day the posse led by the sheriff besieged the invading force at the \"TA Ranch\" on [[Crazy Woman Creek]]. After two days, one of the invaders escaped and was able to contact the acting Governor of Wyoming, [[Amos W. Barber]]. Frantic efforts to save the besieged invaders ensued, and telegraphs to Washington resulted in intervention by the [[President of the United States]], [[Benjamin Harrison]]. The [[Sixth Cavalry]] from [[Fort McKinney (Wyoming)|Fort McKinney]] was ordered to proceed to the \"TA Ranch\" and take custody of the invaders and save them from the posse. As part of the surrender, the invaders turned in all their arms and equipment to the Army. Major Wolcott, as unofficial leader of the group made a list of these arms and provided it to the government.\n\nIn the end the invaders went free due to cunning legal maneuvers by the defense attorneys. Although many of the leaders of the invaders, such as W. C. Irvine, were themselves [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the ranchers who had hired the Invaders were tied to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and their opponents were mostly Democrats. A scandal was caused by the rescue of the Invaders at the order of President Harrison, a Republican, and the failure of the courts to prosecute them. As a result of the scandal, Wyoming voted Democratic in the elections of 1894.\n\n==Dramatic representations==\n*[[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] (1912\u20131990) played Champion in a 1955 episode of [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.\n*[[Christopher Walken]] played a highly fictionalized Champion in [[Michael Cimino]]'s 1980 film ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wyohistory.org/essays/johnson-county-war The Johnson County War: 1892 Invasion of Northern Wyoming] at wyohistory.org\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Champion, Nate}}\n[[Category:1857 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:American cattlemen]]\n[[Category:People from Johnson County, Wyoming]]\n[[Category:People from Leander, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Round Rock, Texas]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Courtesy_Time_life_books_(_the_gun_fighters_)_2014-05-18_11-40.jpg|thumbnail|Courtesy Time life books (the gun fighters)]]\n\n'''Nathan D.

Norman, Oklahoma: [[University of Oklahoma Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4106-0}}.</ref> He is celebrated for his heroic stand in his besieged cabin and for a heartfelt letter written at the time describing the events.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n{{expand section|date=August 2012}}\nNate Champion was born 29 September 1857 in [[Leander, Texas]]. His parents were John and Naomi Champion. One of eighteen brothers and sisters, he grew up in the [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]] area. His father served as sheriff of [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]] for while his Aunt Hattie Cluck drove her own cattle to market in [[Abilene, Kansas]] in 1871. With the money she and her husband George purchased the land that would become Cedar Park. Like most footloose cowboys of that area he worked his way north to Wyoming where he worked for several ranches before building his own spread.\n\n===The Johnson County War===\nThe dramatic events of 1892 took place against a background of violent conflict over land use that stretched from 1889 to 1909. Historian Richard Maxwell Brown refers to the events in Wyoming as part of a wider \"Western Civil War of Incorporation.\"\n\nIn the early days in [[Wyoming]], most of the land was in the public domain, open both to stockraising as [[open range]] and to [[Homestead Act|homesteading]]. Large numbers of [[cattle]] were turned loose on the open range by large [[ranching|ranches]], sometimes financed by other investors. In the spring a roundup was held and the cows and the calves belonging to each ranch were separated and the calves branded. Before the roundup, sometimes calves, especially orphan or stray calves, were surreptitiously branded, and thus taken. The large ranches, concerned about this practice, forbade their employees from owning cattle and aggressively defended against [[rustling]].\n\nThe situation became steadily worse after the poor winter of 1886. The large companies began to aggressively appropriate land and control the flow and supply of water in this area; they justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling, and vigorously sought to exclude the smaller ranchers from participation in the annual roundup; apparently agents of the larger ranches killed several alleged rustlers. A number of [[lynching]]s of alleged rustlers took place in 1889, including the double lynching of innocent homesteaders and ranchers [[Cattle Kate|Ella Watson]] and [[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averell]].<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\nThe large ranches were organized as the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] (the WSGA) and gathered socially as the [[Cheyenne Club]] in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. In April 1892 the WSGA hired killers from [[Texas]]; an expedition of 50 men was organized, which proceeded by train from Cheyenne to [[Casper, Wyoming]], then toward Johnson County, intending to eliminate alleged rustlers and also, apparently, to replace the government in Johnson County. Major [[Frank Wolcott]] led the Regulators into Johnson County. To prevent an alarm, the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines out of [[Buffalo, Wyoming|Buffalo]] were cut. The expedition was accompanied by two [[newspaper]] [[reporter]]s whose lurid accounts later appeared in the eastern newspapers.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n===Attack on Champion===\nThe first target of the WSGA was Nate Champion at the \"KC Ranch\". Champion was a small rancher who was active in the efforts of small ranchers to organize a competing roundup. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men, evidently trappers, who had taken shelter for the night, were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin and died a few hours later. The fourth, Nate Champion, was besieged. Two passers-by noticed the ruckus and rode to Buffalo, where Johnson County [[Sheriff]] William \"Red\" Angus raised a [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|posse]] of 200 men and set out for the \"KC Ranch\".<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/> \n\nChampion held out for several hours, killing at least four of the [[vigilante]]s, and wounding several others. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. \"Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once.\" he wrote. The last journal entry read: \"Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again.\"<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\nWith the house on fire, Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put the journal in his pocket before he emerged, running from the back door with a Colt revolver in the left hand and a Winchester rifle in the right. He was gunned down by four men firing simultaneously, hit by 28 bullets. The invaders later pinned a note on Champion's bullet-riddled chest that read \"Cattle Thieves Beware\". They also  carefully removed entries from the diary which named some of the attackers.<ref name=\"Davis, John W. 2010\"/>\n\n===Aftermath of death===\nThe following day the posse led by the sheriff besieged the invading force at the \"TA Ranch\" on [[Crazy Woman Creek]]. After two days, one of the invaders escaped and was able to contact the acting Governor of Wyoming, [[Amos W. Barber]]. Frantic efforts to save the besieged invaders ensued, and telegraphs to Washington resulted in intervention by the [[President of the United States]], [[Benjamin Harrison]]. The [[Sixth Cavalry]] from [[Fort McKinney (Wyoming)|Fort McKinney]] was ordered to proceed to the \"TA Ranch\" and take custody of the invaders and save them from the posse. As part of the surrender, the invaders turned in all their arms and equipment to the Army. Major Wolcott, as unofficial leader of the group made a list of these arms and provided it to the government.\n\nIn the end the invaders went free due to cunning legal maneuvers by the defense attorneys. Although many of the leaders of the invaders, such as W. C. Irvine, were themselves [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the ranchers who had hired the Invaders were tied to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and their opponents were mostly Democrats. A scandal was caused by the rescue of the Invaders at the order of President Harrison, a Republican, and the failure of the courts to prosecute them. As a result of the scandal, Wyoming voted Democratic in the elections of 1894.\n\n==Dramatic representations==\n*[[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] (1912\u20131990) played Champion in a 1955 episode of [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.\n*[[Christopher Walken]] played a highly fictionalized Champion in [[Michael Cimino]]'s 1980 film ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wyohistory.org/essays/johnson-county-war The Johnson County War: 1892 Invasion of Northern Wyoming] at wyohistory.org\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Champion, Nate}}\n[[Category:1857 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:American cattlemen]]\n[[Category:People from Johnson County, Wyoming]]\n[[Category:People from Leander, Texas]]\n[[Category:People from Round Rock, Texas]]\n", "name_user": "Chris j wood", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Champion"}

These planes have since been decommissioned, but not before seeing ample use in the latter\u2018s domestic military operations against communist and Muslim separatist insurgents. In addition to this, South Korea has also donated a number of [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero|T-41]] trainer planes.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea donated the ROKS Chungju, a ''Pohang''-class corvette, to the [[Philippine Navy]]. She was handed over, refitted, and commissioned as the [[BRP Conrado Yap (PS-39)]] on 5 August 2019.\n<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-donates-philippine-2014-6</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/238091-philippines-welcomes-most-powerful-warship-conrado-yap</ref>\n\nThe South Korean government also actively fulfills contracts for the Philippines for a variety of military hardware. These range from [[Daewoo Precision Industries K3|small arms]], [[Kia KLTV|armored tactical vehicles]], missile frigates, to multirole fighters.\n\nIn 2017, South Korea delivered the last batch of the 12 [[FA-50|FA-50 Fighting Eagle]] multirole fighters ordered by the Philippines. <ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/166409-philippines-fighter-jets-complete</ref> \n\nOn 16 October 2018, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] began construction on the future [[BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150)]], the first missile frigate of her [[Jose Rizal-class frigate|class]] and one of two that had been placed on order by the Philippine government.

These planes have since been decommissioned, but not before seeing ample use in the latter\u2018s domestic military operations against communist and Muslim separatist insurgents. In addition to this, South Korea has also donated a number of [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero|T-41]] trainer planes.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea donated the ROKS Chungju, a ''Pohang''-class corvette, to the [[Philippine Navy]]. She was handed over, refitted, and commissioned as the [[BRP Conrado Yap (PS-39)]] on 5 August 2019.\n<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-donates-philippine-2014-6</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/238091-philippines-welcomes-most-powerful-warship-conrado-yap</ref>\n\nThe South Korean government also actively fulfills contracts for the Philippines for a variety of military hardware. These range from [[Daewoo Precision Industries K3|small arms]], [[Kia KLTV|armored tactical vehicles]], missile frigates, to multirole fighters.\n\nIn 2017, South Korea delivered the last batch of the 12 [[FA-50|FA-50 Fighting Eagle]] multirole fighters ordered by the Philippines. <ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/166409-philippines-fighter-jets-complete</ref> \n\nOn 16 October 2018, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] began construction on the future [[BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150)]], the first missile frigate of her [[Jose Rizal-class frigate|class]] and one of two that had been placed on order by the Philippine government. She was launched on 23 May 2019. Construction on the next missile frigate, [[BRP Antonio Luna (FF-151)]], began on the same day. The latter was launched on 8 November 2019 and is expected to be commissioned some time in 2020.\n\n==Others==\n\nAs of 2011, there are currently more than 90,000 [[Koreans in the Philippines|South Koreans]] in the Philippines.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration.

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address. I loved the idea, went straight to [[NBC]] with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a [[Television pilot|pilot show]].<ref name=\"lowry\">{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Cynthia|title=Merv Griffin: Question and Answer Man|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Pasadena Star-News|Independent Star-News]]|date = March 29, 1964}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- |title=What Is Jeopardy!'? |last1=Lidz |first1=Franz |date=May 1, 1989 |website=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. |access-date=October 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423161445/http://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/01/119810/television-for-1000-the-worlds-toughest-game-show-what-is-jeopardy- |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n}}\n\nGriffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=2}} He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting \"Who is&nbsp;...\" for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=4}} Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, ''What's the Question?'', when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, \"It doesn't have enough [[wikt:jeopardy|jeopardies]].\"{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=2}}{{Sfn|Griffin|Bender|2003|p=71}}\n\n''Jeopardy!'' was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

They had a singer in the band, but were looking for a replacement because he wasn't very good. Lenny is later introduced to Anthony Santos via a mutual friend who attended the same school as him. Lenny and Anthony clicked instantly, and worked on songs together. Anthony introduces his cousin Henry to Lenny and Max, and they all formed the group Los Tinellers in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/aventura-hits-lady-gaga-park-headlining-4-msg-shows-article-1.457611|title=Aventura hits Lady Gaga out of the park, headlining 4 MSG shows - who are they?|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> The group was discovered by Elvin Polanco at a local parade in the Bronx when Lenny and Romeo asked him if they could perform in the parade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://listindiario.com/entretenimiento/2016/11/07/442117/a-20-anos-del-primer-album-de-aventura|title=A 20 a\u00f1os del primer \u00e1lbum de Aventura|last=Diario|first=Listin|date=2016-11-07|website=listindiario.com|language=ES|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Elvin became their manager and helped them record their first studio album. They released their debut album in 1995 titled \"Trampa de Amor\" under Elca Productions.The album did not do well commercially. Elvin Polanco ran into some heatlh problems and the group was left without a manager at that time.\n\nIn 1996, with the help of new manager Julio C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda, the group created a new image. Julio added Max and Henry and made the group to resemble popular American boy bands. They renamed the group to Aventura and signed with Premium Latin Music, Inc. They made their big break in 1999, with the hopes of breaking bachata music into the mainstream from its traditional base.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latintrends.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-aventura/|title=What You Didn\u2019t Know about Aventura \u2013 LatinTRENDS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> The group was the first to experiment with bachata by fusing the genre with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rapping|rap]] and [[Rock music|rock]].

They had a singer in the band, but were looking for a replacement because he wasn't very good. Lenny is later introduced to Anthony Santos via a mutual friend who attended the same school as him. Lenny and Anthony clicked instantly, and worked on songs together. Anthony introduces his cousin Henry to Lenny and Max, and they all formed the group Los Tinellers in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/aventura-hits-lady-gaga-park-headlining-4-msg-shows-article-1.457611|title=Aventura hits Lady Gaga out of the park, headlining 4 MSG shows - who are they?|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> The group was discovered by Elvin Polanco at a local parade in the Bronx when Lenny and Romeo asked him if they could perform in the parade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://listindiario.com/entretenimiento/2016/11/07/442117/a-20-anos-del-primer-album-de-aventura|title=A 20 a\u00f1os del primer \u00e1lbum de Aventura|last=Diario|first=Listin|date=2016-11-07|website=listindiario.com|language=ES|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Elvin became their manager and helped them record their first studio album. They released their debut album in 1995 titled \"Trampa de Amor\" under Elca Productions.The album did not do well commercially. Elvin Polanco ran into some heatlh problems and the group was left without a manager at that time.\n\nIn 1996, with the help of new manager Julio C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda, the group created a new image. Julio added Max and Henry and made the group to resemble popular American boy bands. They renamed the group to Aventura and signed with Premium Latin Music, Inc. They made their big break in 1999, with the hopes of breaking bachata music into the mainstream from its traditional base.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latintrends.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-aventura/|title=What You Didn\u2019t Know about Aventura \u2013 LatinTRENDS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> The group was the first to experiment with bachata by fusing the genre with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rapping|rap]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. Aventura broke bachata rules. They were the first bachata act to sing a whole bachata song in English.
