The highlands  have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences.

According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Eritrea have either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the highest elevations.<ref name=Mussie/>\n\nIn the central highlands, the hottest month is usually May to June with highs around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (80.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing point.

Prominent members have included many [[Irish people|Irish]] men and women of note, from the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] revolutionary [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and the author [[Bram Stoker]], to founding father of the Northern Irish state [[Edward Carson]] and first President of Ireland [[Douglas Hyde]], and - in more recent times - [[Government of Ireland|Government]] [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] [[Mary Harney]]<ref name=\"IT 250\"/> (who was the first female auditor of the society) and [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]].\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe first meeting of the College Historical Society took place on Wednesday 21 March 1770.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/7/historical-society |title=The Hist Page |accessdate=4 September 2019 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227031312/http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/7/historical-society |date=February 27, 2012 |website=[[List of Trinity College Dublin student organisations#Societies|TrinitySocieties.ie]] |via=[[Wayback Machine]] |archivedate=27 February 2012}}</ref> The society took into its care the minute book of '''Burke's Club''', founded 1747, from which the Hist has since drawn inspiration. Its other precursor was the '''Historical Club''', founded 1753, of which [[Henry Grattan]] was a member. James Reid became the first auditor of the Hist later in 1770. It was a time of great change in [[Ireland]] and the [[Western world]], at the height of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and before the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]]. From its inception it showed itself to be at the forefront of intellectual thought in Ireland, and many of its members later went into politics. In 1782, [[Lawrence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse|Lawrence Parsons]] was elected as an MP for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] at 24, having served as auditor of the Hist just the previous year.\n\n===Restrictions and expulsions===\nTheobald Wolfe Tone, later leader of the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], was elected auditor in 1785, and [[Thomas Addis Emmet]] was a member of the committee. The society was briefly expelled from the college in 1794, but readmitted on the condition that \"No question of modern politics shall be debated\". In 1797, the poet [[Thomas Moore]] and the nationalist [[Robert Emmet]] were elected as members.{{sfn|various|1892|p=254}} Eight members{{ref|contumacy|A}} of The Hist were expelled in 1798{{sfn|various|1892|p=85-88}} in the run-up to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Rebellion]], and a motion was later carried condemning the rebellion, against their former auditor.\n\nTension between the society and the college flourished in the early nineteenth century, with the auditor being called before the provost in 1810. In 1812 the provost, Dr [[Thomas Elrington (bishop)|Thomas Elrington]], objected vehemently to the question \u2018Was Brutus justifiable in putting Julius Caesar to death?\u2019. After a number of members were removed at the request of the college board, the society left the college in 1815.\n\n===The Extern Society===\nThe society continued from 1815 as the Extern Historical Society. Among its members at this time were [[Isaac Butt]], a president of the society<ref name=\"Monitor\">{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-dec-27-1913-1340776 |title=Life Story of Isaac Butt - His Early Career - Political Opponent of O'Connell |work=[[The Monitor and New Era]] |location=[[London]] |date=27 December 1913 |page=6 |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]] |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref> who tried unsuccessfully in 1832 to have the society readmitted, [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan LeFanu]], [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] (a president of the society)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.from-ireland.net/address-historical-society-thomas-osborne-davis/ |title=Address to the Historical Society, Thomas Osborne Davis |last=Davis |first=Thomas Osborne |date=June 1840 |access-date=19 February 2020 |via=From-Ireland.net}}</ref>{{sfn|Potter|2017|p=27}} and [[John Blake Dillon]] and many other notables of the nationalist cause. In 1843, under auditor [[William Connor Magee]], future [[Archbishop of York]],{{sfn|various|1892|p=127,253}} the society reformed within the college after a student petition, again on the condition that no subject of current politics was debated. This provision remains in the Laws of the Hist as a nod to the past, but the college authorities have long since ceased to restrict the subjects of the society's debates.\n\n===The 19th century===\nThe society continued successfully after that with many lively debates, including the motion on June 10, 1857 \u2018That the Reform Bill of Lord Grey was not framed in accordance with the wants of the country\u2019, proposed by Isaac Butt and opposed by [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]]. This era was considered by many to be the high point of the society, with many of its members moving to high political positions. It was common for the [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] for the University to have served on the Committee of the Hist, such as Edward Gibson and [[David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore|David Plunkett]], who were both auditors, and [[Edward Carson]], who was the Librarian. [[Bram Stoker]], author of Dracula, became auditor in 1872. In 1864 the society collected money from its members to erect statues of Edmund Burke and [[Oliver Goldsmith]] at the Front Gate of College.\n\nThe society moved to the Graduates' Memorial Building (GMB) in 1904, which it shares with the [[University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|University Philosophical Society]]. The college board relaxed its rules, allowing such motions as \u2018That the Gaelic League is deserving of the support of every Irishman\u2019 in 1905 and 1906.\n\n===The 20th and 21st centuries===\nThe society continued well through the twentieth century, although the [[World War I|First World War]] hit it badly, with 136 of its former members killed. Eoin O'Mahony was elected auditor in 1930 and faced impeachment when he raised a toast to Ireland instead of the King. Eoin O'Mahony offered Lord Carson the presidency of the society in 1931, although Carson declined due to ill health, recommending that the position be offered to former gold medallist and future [[President of Ireland]] [[Douglas Hyde]], who was elected to the position. The current president is Prof. David McConnell, a former librarian and auditor of the society and a winner of The Irish Times Debating Competition, and now chairman of [[The Irish Times]] Trust and one of Europe's foremost geneticists.\n\nSon of [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Michael Yeats]] became auditor in 1944, and in that capacity organised the inaugural meeting on 'The small nations'; Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera and Jan Masaryk, minister for foreign affairs in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile in London, were his main speakers. Yeats had further involvement with the society in 1969, when it proposed admitting women members. The proposal passed by a single vote; having supported it, Yeats contended that had he stayed at home on the night of the vote the society would have remained all male.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do;jsessionid=2D4305D2D6C552F8975581B21E05111B?articleId=a9839|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press|website=dib.cambridge.org|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\nWomen had been refused membership of the society until 1969. Soon after the change in the rules, the society debated the motion \u2018That this House reveres the memory of [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Mrs Pankhurst]]' with [[Rosaleen Mills]] participating (the motion, however, was defeated). The first female auditor, future [[T\u00e1naiste]] [[Mary Harney]], was elected in 1976. {{as of|2019|alt=Since then}} the society has had four female auditors. The society's Bicentennial Meeting in 1970 was addressed by US Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], at which he called the society \"the greatest of the school of the orators\" {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.\n\nRecent developments have seen the re-opening of the Resource Library, operated in conjunction with the Phil, which holds over 200 books and is made available as a general study area and library for the use of the members of the society. The society has also extensively re-developed the Conversation Room with the addition of better facilities such as wireless Internet access.\n\n==Chamber debating==\nThe main business of the society is the weekly debates held each Wednesday Night during term time. Chamber debating, including the debates (known as Public Business Meetings) with invited guest speakers for which the society is best known, tends to be less formalised (even if more formal) than competitive debates, and the manner of delivery is closer to public speaking, with audience engagement far more important.\n\nThe Weekly Debate is the second of the society's weekly meeting, with the Private Business Meeting being the first. In this, the internal business of the society is conducted by the General Committee with an Ordinary Member chairing: motions internal to the society may be put to the House and debated, questions asked to the Committee and Officers, and Fines contested and administered. The Minutes read at both this and the Public Business Meeting are usually comedic, with the Record Secretary making a speech that has little, if any, relation to the previous week's meeting. \n \nThe Meeting then moves to Public Business, where an invited guest, usually someone of expertise or involvement in the matter being debated, chairs the debate in which both student and guest speakers from the Proposition or Opposition bench take the floor. During speeches, Points of Information may be offered from the floor or opposing bench. Shorter, impromptu Floor Speeches may also be given if there is interest from the student audience. At the debate's conclusion, the motion is put to the House followed by a speech from the occupant of the Chair who usually offers his thoughts on how the debate proceeded. Students and guests then proceed to a reception where discussion of the matter is usually continued.\n\nThe motions are varied and wide-ranging, giving students an opportunity to debate with experts on the specific motion chosen, usually based on an important issue taking place in current affairs. The society addresses controversial issues. In 2005, over 500 people attempted to gain access to a debate on abortion which was targeted by [[Youth Defence]] protesters and a debate on euthanasia was recorded for an upcoming documentary on the pro-euthanasia group [[Dignitas - To live with dignity - To die with dignity|Dignitas]] for the Canadian [[Discovery Channel]].\n\nProminent politicians such as [[David Ervine]], [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[John Hume]] have spoken in debates on [[Northern Ireland]]. In 2005 the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] T.D. unveiled proposals for reform of the legal profession at a Hist debate on the matter. The Inaugural Meeting of the 236th Session in 2006 was addressed by Dr. [[Mary Robinson]], a former President of Ireland, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Chancellor of the University of Dublin. The society has the distinction of having been addressed by every Taoiseach and President of the Ireland.\n\n==Competitive debating==\nBefore the creation of a competitive debating structure, representatives of the society were invited to speak at similar societies internationally. As early as 1932 [[James Auchmuty]] and Garrett Gill travelled to [[Moorhead, Minnesota|Moorhead]] to speak at [[Minnesota]] [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|State University]].<ref name=\"Moorhead\">{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/entertainment-clipping-oct-29-1932-1340754/ |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]] |title=Trinity College to Debate here |work=[[Moorhead Daily News]] |date=29 October 1932 |location=[[Moorhead, Minnesota]] |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n[[Image:Mary Robinson at the Irish Times Debating Competition.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Irish President and UN Human Rights Commissioner [[Mary Robinson]] at the Hist, 2007]]\n<!--[[Image:EU204a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|French Prime Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] at the Hist, 2007]] -->\nThe society's best debaters compete nationally and internationally against other societies in competitions, most usually of the [[British Parliamentary debating]] style with the notable exception being the prestigious [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times public-speaking competition]].  The society regularly fields one of the most successful teams in Ireland having been represented in the Grand Final of The Irish Times Debating Competition in 2006, and winning it in three consecutive years, in 2007, 2008 and 2009. It is second to the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin when it comes to individual and team victories. It is also a force internationally, competing regularly at foreign Inter-Varsities and at both the [[World Universities Debating Championship]] and [[European Universities Debating Championships]] (the society having hosted the former in 1992).\n\nThe society jointly hosts the Trinity Women's Open, the Robert Emmett Invitational summer Open, and the [[Jonathan Swift|Dean Swift]] Intervarsity (Trinity IV), the largest and most prestigious Irish Inter-varsity, with the [[University Philosophical Society]]. The society also fosters development and competition within itself, running frequent workshops and internal competitions: most notably its Maiden Speaker Competition and the Wolfe Tones's Public Speaking Competition.\n\nIt also plays a prominent role in providing Secondary School Level Debating, jointly running the esteemed Leinster Schools' Debating Competition with the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]] and its own Schools' Mace.\n\n==Notable speakers==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\n{{Cleanup list|section|date=February 2010}}\n[[Image:John Major at the Hist Inaugural.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[John Major|Sir John Major]] speaking at the Inaugural Meeting of the 238th Session]]\n\nThe society has a long history of hosting international figures, intellectuals and personalities.\n\n===Political figures and public intellectuals===\n*[[Gordon Brown]], the former British prime minister was awarded the Society's Gold Medal on Friday 10 December 2010<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1211/1224285303520.html|title=PM's question time: Gordon Brown in Dublin to promote new book|work=The Irish Times|date=11 December 2010}}</ref>\n*Sir [[Winston Churchill]], former British prime minister<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcdhist.com/awards-of-the-society|title=Awards of the Society|website=College Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n*[[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], United States Senator\n*[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], former French President\n*[[Clement Attlee]], former British prime minister\n*Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]], former British prime minister\n*Sir [[John Major]], former British prime minister\n*[[Paul Henri Spaak]], one of the founders of the European Union.\n*[[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.

Several Vice-Presidents, usually distinguished Honorary Members of the society, also serve the society in a largely ceremonial position. The vast majority of the society's operation and management is conducted by the General Committee, made up of the President; the ex-Auditor; the Officers of the session (listed below), ''ex officio'', and fourteen other members of the society.\n\nThe roles of these officers are:\n*the Auditor leads the committee, is responsible for the final accounts of the society and delivers an address at the society's annual inaugural meeting on a subject of their choosing.\n*the Treasurer oversees the society's expenditure and income, membership subscriptions, fines and the Billiards rooms.\n*the Correspondence Secretary organises the society's Wednesday night debates, inviting guest speakers and selecting members to give speeches.*\n*the Record Secretary is charged with the keeping of the society's records, laws and membership lists, correspondence with the society's honorary members, running of the internal Maidens competition and reading/taking of minutes at all meetings of the society and committee.\n*the Censor publicises the society's activities to its members and college, organising the writing and publication of the society's annual magazine, the HistOracle.\n*the Librarian manages the society's library, runs its secondary school debating competitions and takes attendance before debates.\n*the Debates Convenor encourages and develops competitive debating within the society, sending teams to external competitions and co-convening the Trinity IV and Open with their counterpart in the Phil. This position is appointed by the new committee of the society following each annual election.\n*the Events Convenor organises social events for the members of the society, including the receptions after the Wednesday night debates.\n*the Senior Member of Committee is responsible for coordinating the work of the fourteen general members of committee including setting up before debates, tidying the society's rooms, cleaning glasses after receptions etc.\n\n==Presidents and vice-presidents==\n===Presidents of the society since 1843===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n!Term\n!President\n!Hist record\n!Other roles\n|-\n| 1843\u20131851\n| Rev.

Prominent members have included many [[Irish people|Irish]] men and women of note, from the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] revolutionary [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and the author [[Bram Stoker]], to founding father of the Northern Irish state [[Edward Carson]] and first President of Ireland [[Douglas Hyde]], and - in more recent times - [[Government of Ireland|Government]] [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] [[Mary Harney]]<ref name=\"IT 250\"/> (who was the first female auditor of the society) and [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]].\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe first meeting of the College Historical Society took place on Wednesday 21 March 1770.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/7/historical-society |title=The Hist Page |accessdate=4 September 2019 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227031312/http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/7/historical-society |date=February 27, 2012 |website=[[List of Trinity College Dublin student organisations#Societies|TrinitySocieties.ie]] |via=[[Wayback Machine]] |archivedate=27 February 2012}}</ref> The society took into its care the minute book of '''Burke's Club''', founded 1747, from which the Hist has since drawn inspiration. Its other precursor was the '''Historical Club''', founded 1753, of which [[Henry Grattan]] was a member. James Reid became the first auditor of the Hist later in 1770. It was a time of great change in [[Ireland]] and the [[Western world]], at the height of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and before the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]]. From its inception it showed itself to be at the forefront of intellectual thought in Ireland, and many of its members later went into politics. In 1782, [[Lawrence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse|Lawrence Parsons]] was elected as an MP for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] at 24, having served as auditor of the Hist just the previous year.\n\n===Restrictions and expulsions===\nTheobald Wolfe Tone, later leader of the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], was elected auditor in 1785, and [[Thomas Addis Emmet]] was a member of the committee. The society was briefly expelled from the college in 1794, but readmitted on the condition that \"No question of modern politics shall be debated\". In 1797, the poet [[Thomas Moore]] and the nationalist [[Robert Emmet]] were elected as members.{{sfn|various|1892|p=254}} Eight members{{ref|contumacy|A}} of The Hist were expelled in 1798{{sfn|various|1892|p=85-88}} in the run-up to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Rebellion]], and a motion was later carried condemning the rebellion, against their former auditor.\n\nTension between the society and the college flourished in the early nineteenth century, with the auditor being called before the provost in 1810. In 1812 the provost, Dr [[Thomas Elrington (bishop)|Thomas Elrington]], objected vehemently to the question \u2018Was Brutus justifiable in putting Julius Caesar to death?\u2019. After a number of members were removed at the request of the college board, the society left the college in 1815.\n\n===The Extern Society===\nThe society continued from 1815 as the Extern Historical Society. Among its members at this time were [[Isaac Butt]], a president of the society<ref name=\"Monitor\">{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-dec-27-1913-1340776 |title=Life Story of Isaac Butt - His Early Career - Political Opponent of O'Connell |work=[[The Monitor and New Era]] |location=[[London]] |date=27 December 1913 |page=6 |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]] |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref> who tried unsuccessfully in 1832 to have the society readmitted, [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan LeFanu]], [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] (a president of the society)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.from-ireland.net/address-historical-society-thomas-osborne-davis/ |title=Address to the Historical Society, Thomas Osborne Davis |last=Davis |first=Thomas Osborne |date=June 1840 |access-date=19 February 2020 |via=From-Ireland.net}}</ref>{{sfn|Potter|2017|p=27}} and [[John Blake Dillon]] and many other notables of the nationalist cause. In 1843, under auditor [[William Connor Magee]], future [[Archbishop of York]],{{sfn|various|1892|p=127,253}} the society reformed within the college after a student petition, again on the condition that no subject of current politics was debated. This provision remains in the Laws of the Hist as a nod to the past, but the college authorities have long since ceased to restrict the subjects of the society's debates.\n\n===The 19th century===\nThe society continued successfully after that with many lively debates, including the motion on June 10, 1857 \u2018That the Reform Bill of Lord Grey was not framed in accordance with the wants of the country\u2019, proposed by Isaac Butt and opposed by [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]]. This era was considered by many to be the high point of the society, with many of its members moving to high political positions. It was common for the [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] for the University to have served on the Committee of the Hist, such as Edward Gibson and [[David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore|David Plunkett]], who were both auditors, and [[Edward Carson]], who was the Librarian. [[Bram Stoker]], author of Dracula, became auditor in 1872. In 1864 the society collected money from its members to erect statues of Edmund Burke and [[Oliver Goldsmith]] at the Front Gate of College.\n\nThe society moved to the Graduates' Memorial Building (GMB) in 1904, which it shares with the [[University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|University Philosophical Society]]. The college board relaxed its rules, allowing such motions as \u2018That the Gaelic League is deserving of the support of every Irishman\u2019 in 1905 and 1906.\n\n===The 20th and 21st centuries===\nThe society continued well through the twentieth century, although the [[World War I|First World War]] hit it badly, with 136 of its former members killed. Eoin O'Mahony was elected auditor in 1930 and faced impeachment when he raised a toast to Ireland instead of the King. Eoin O'Mahony offered Lord Carson the presidency of the society in 1931, although Carson declined due to ill health, recommending that the position be offered to former gold medallist and future [[President of Ireland]] [[Douglas Hyde]], who was elected to the position. The current president is Prof. David McConnell, a former librarian and auditor of the society and a winner of The Irish Times Debating Competition, and now chairman of [[The Irish Times]] Trust and one of Europe's foremost geneticists.\n\nSon of [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Michael Yeats]] became auditor in 1944, and in that capacity organised the inaugural meeting on 'The small nations'; Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera and Jan Masaryk, minister for foreign affairs in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile in London, were his main speakers. Yeats had further involvement with the society in 1969, when it proposed admitting women members. The proposal passed by a single vote; having supported it, Yeats contended that had he stayed at home on the night of the vote the society would have remained all male.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do;jsessionid=2D4305D2D6C552F8975581B21E05111B?articleId=a9839|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press|website=dib.cambridge.org|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\nWomen had been refused membership of the society until 1969. Soon after the change in the rules, the society debated the motion \u2018That this House reveres the memory of [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Mrs Pankhurst]]' with [[Rosaleen Mills]] participating (the motion, however, was defeated). The first female auditor, future [[T\u00e1naiste]] [[Mary Harney]], was elected in 1976. {{as of|2019|alt=Since then}} the society has had four female auditors. The society's Bicentennial Meeting in 1970 was addressed by US Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], at which he called the society \"the greatest of the school of the orators\" {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.\n\nRecent developments have seen the re-opening of the Resource Library, operated in conjunction with the Phil, which holds over 200 books and is made available as a general study area and library for the use of the members of the society. The society has also extensively re-developed the Conversation Room with the addition of better facilities such as wireless Internet access.\n\n==Chamber debating==\nThe main business of the society is the weekly debates held each Wednesday Night during term time. Chamber debating, including the debates (known as Public Business Meetings) with invited guest speakers for which the society is best known, tends to be less formalised (even if more formal) than competitive debates, and the manner of delivery is closer to public speaking, with audience engagement far more important.\n\nThe Weekly Debate is the second of the society's weekly meeting, with the Private Business Meeting being the first. In this, the internal business of the society is conducted by the General Committee with an Ordinary Member chairing: motions internal to the society may be put to the House and debated, questions asked to the Committee and Officers, and Fines contested and administered. The Minutes read at both this and the Public Business Meeting are usually comedic, with the Record Secretary making a speech that has little, if any, relation to the previous week's meeting. \n \nThe Meeting then moves to Public Business, where an invited guest, usually someone of expertise or involvement in the matter being debated, chairs the debate in which both student and guest speakers from the Proposition or Opposition bench take the floor. During speeches, Points of Information may be offered from the floor or opposing bench. Shorter, impromptu Floor Speeches may also be given if there is interest from the student audience. At the debate's conclusion, the motion is put to the House followed by a speech from the occupant of the Chair who usually offers his thoughts on how the debate proceeded. Students and guests then proceed to a reception where discussion of the matter is usually continued.\n\nThe motions are varied and wide-ranging, giving students an opportunity to debate with experts on the specific motion chosen, usually based on an important issue taking place in current affairs. The society addresses controversial issues. In 2005, over 500 people attempted to gain access to a debate on abortion which was targeted by [[Youth Defence]] protesters and a debate on euthanasia was recorded for an upcoming documentary on the pro-euthanasia group [[Dignitas - To live with dignity - To die with dignity|Dignitas]] for the Canadian [[Discovery Channel]].\n\nProminent politicians such as [[David Ervine]], [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[John Hume]] have spoken in debates on [[Northern Ireland]]. In 2005 the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] T.D. unveiled proposals for reform of the legal profession at a Hist debate on the matter. The Inaugural Meeting of the 236th Session in 2006 was addressed by Dr. [[Mary Robinson]], a former President of Ireland, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Chancellor of the University of Dublin. The society has the distinction of having been addressed by every Taoiseach and President of the Ireland.\n\n==Competitive debating==\nBefore the creation of a competitive debating structure, representatives of the society were invited to speak at similar societies internationally. As early as 1932 [[James Auchmuty]] and Garrett Gill travelled to [[Moorhead, Minnesota|Moorhead]] to speak at [[Minnesota]] [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|State University]].<ref name=\"Moorhead\">{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/entertainment-clipping-oct-29-1932-1340754/ |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]] |title=Trinity College to Debate here |work=[[Moorhead Daily News]] |date=29 October 1932 |location=[[Moorhead, Minnesota]] |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n[[Image:Mary Robinson at the Irish Times Debating Competition.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Irish President and UN Human Rights Commissioner [[Mary Robinson]] at the Hist, 2007]]\n<!--[[Image:EU204a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|French Prime Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] at the Hist, 2007]] -->\nThe society's best debaters compete nationally and internationally against other societies in competitions, most usually of the [[British Parliamentary debating]] style with the notable exception being the prestigious [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times public-speaking competition]].  The society regularly fields one of the most successful teams in Ireland having been represented in the Grand Final of The Irish Times Debating Competition in 2006, and winning it in three consecutive years, in 2007, 2008 and 2009. It is second to the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin when it comes to individual and team victories. It is also a force internationally, competing regularly at foreign Inter-Varsities and at both the [[World Universities Debating Championship]] and [[European Universities Debating Championships]] (the society having hosted the former in 1992).\n\nThe society jointly hosts the Trinity Women's Open, the Robert Emmett Invitational summer Open, and the [[Jonathan Swift|Dean Swift]] Intervarsity (Trinity IV), the largest and most prestigious Irish Inter-varsity, with the [[University Philosophical Society]]. The society also fosters development and competition within itself, running frequent workshops and internal competitions: most notably its Maiden Speaker Competition and the Wolfe Tones's Public Speaking Competition.\n\nIt also plays a prominent role in providing Secondary School Level Debating, jointly running the esteemed Leinster Schools' Debating Competition with the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]] and its own Schools' Mace.\n\n==Notable speakers==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\n{{Cleanup list|section|date=February 2010}}\n[[Image:John Major at the Hist Inaugural.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[John Major|Sir John Major]] speaking at the Inaugural Meeting of the 238th Session]]\n\nThe society has a long history of hosting international figures, intellectuals and personalities.\n\n===Political figures and public intellectuals===\n*[[Gordon Brown]], the former British prime minister was awarded the Society's Gold Medal on Friday 10 December 2010<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1211/1224285303520.html|title=PM's question time: Gordon Brown in Dublin to promote new book|work=The Irish Times|date=11 December 2010}}</ref>\n*Sir [[Winston Churchill]], former British prime minister<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcdhist.com/awards-of-the-society|title=Awards of the Society|website=College Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n*[[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], United States Senator\n*[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], former French President\n*[[Clement Attlee]], former British prime minister\n*Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]], former British prime minister\n*Sir [[John Major]], former British prime minister\n*[[Paul Henri Spaak]], one of the founders of the European Union.\n*[[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.

Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training.

In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by ''uke'' (and which ''tori'' must defend against) have been criticized as being \"weak\", \"sloppy\", and \"little more than caricatures of an attack\".<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\">{{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Aikido Practice Today| journal = Aiki News| volume = 86| publisher = Aiki News| date = Fall 1990| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| accessdate = 2 November 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231252/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| archivedate = 21 November 2007| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Ledyard| first = George S.| title = Non-Traditional Attacks| work = aikiweb.com|date=June 2002| url = http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| accessdate = 29 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080725060329/http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| archivedate= 25 July 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Weak attacks from ''uke'' allow for a conditioned response from ''tori'', and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\"/> To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.

Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the [[spear]] ({{transl|ja|''[[yari]]''}}), short [[Stick fighting|staff]] ({{transl|ja|''[[j\u014d]]''}}), and possibly the {{Nihongo|[[bayonet]]|\u9283\u5263|j\u016bken}}.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

This trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by [[Hiroshi Tada]]; and Germany in 1965 by [[Katsuaki Asai]]. Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.\n\n===Proliferation of independent organizations===\n{{further|Aikido styles}}\n{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid\u014dka}}\n\nThe largest aikido organization is the [[Aikikai Foundation]], which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has developed into many styles, most of which were formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nThe earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name=\"Mochizuki\"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Yoshinkan Aikido \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |archivedate=26 September 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite book\n| last = Shishido\n| first = Fumiaki\n| authorlink = Fumiaki Shishida\n|last2=Nariyama\n|first2=Tetsuro\n|authorlink2= Tetsuro Nariyama\n| title = Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge\n| publisher = Shodokan Publishing USA\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7\n}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and [[Physical exercise|conditioning]], as well as specific techniques.<ref name=\"AFL\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma\n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20 20]\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20\n}}</ref> Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of [[throw (grappling)|throws]], beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.<ref name=\"AFL\"/> The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and [[Pinning hold|pins]]. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.\n\n===Fitness===\n[[File:A\u00efkido-shihoo nage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uke (martial arts)|Ukemi]] ({{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8eab}}) is very important for safe practice]]\nPhysical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed. It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab face strike'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a\u9762\u6253\u3061|kata-dori men-uchi}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest grab'''|\u80f8\u53d6\u308a|mune-dori or muna-dori}}, when the lapel is grabbed; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"collar grab\"|\u895f\u53d6\u308a|eri-dori}}.\n\n===Basic techniques===\n{{main|Aikido techniques}}\n[[File:Aikido ikkyo.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of ''ikky\u014d'', or \"first technique\".

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.
