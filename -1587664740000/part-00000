General Electric improved the fan module and the high-pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduced clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, were stated by GE to lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing's wing modifications were intended to deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another {{cvt|75|nmi}} on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or {{cvt|2400|lb}} of cargo to a \"load limited\" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Mind the gap\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 \u2013 March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were unveiled.  The 777-300ER was to shed {{cvt|1800|lb}} by replacing the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. The new flight control software was to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing was also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip was to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a \"poor man's airfoil\" by Boeing; this was originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project. Another change involved elevator trim bias. These changes were to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Sharpened edge\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 16\u201329, 2015, pp. 26-8.</ref>\n\nMindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered ten 777-300ERs, normally costing around US$150 million each but paid around US$130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://leehamnews.com/2015/01/20/odds-and-ends-bbds-sheridan-to-nordic-united-and-777s/ |title= United and 777-300ERs |date= January 20, 2015 |publisher= Leeham News |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>  The roll-out of the prototype 777X, a 777-9 model, occurred on March 13, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |title=Boeing Unveils 777-9 In Low-Key Event |url=https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-unveils-777-9-low-key-event |work=aviationweek.com |date=March 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, Boeing lists prices for the 777-200ER, -200LR, 777F, -300ER, 777-8, and 777-9 variants.

General Electric improved the fan module and the high-pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduced clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, were stated by GE to lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing's wing modifications were intended to deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another {{cvt|75|nmi}} on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or {{cvt|2400|lb}} of cargo to a \"load limited\" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Mind the gap\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 \u2013 March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were unveiled.  The 777-300ER was to shed {{cvt|1800|lb}} by replacing the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. The new flight control software was to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing was also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip was to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a \"poor man's airfoil\" by Boeing; this was originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project. Another change involved elevator trim bias. These changes were to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Sharpened edge\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 16\u201329, 2015, pp. 26-8.</ref>\n\nMindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered ten 777-300ERs, normally costing around US$150 million each but paid around US$130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://leehamnews.com/2015/01/20/odds-and-ends-bbds-sheridan-to-nordic-united-and-777s/ |title= United and 777-300ERs |date= January 20, 2015 |publisher= Leeham News |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>  The roll-out of the prototype 777X, a 777-9 model, occurred on March 13, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |title=Boeing Unveils 777-9 In Low-Key Event |url=https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-unveils-777-9-low-key-event |work=aviationweek.com |date=March 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, Boeing lists prices for the 777-200ER, -200LR, 777F, -300ER, 777-8, and 777-9 variants.

CRS is mainly used to image lipid, protein, and other bio-molecules in live or fixed cells or tissues without labeling or staining the sample<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1062325706|title=Coherent raman scattering microscopy|others=Cheng, Ji-Xin,, Xie, Xiaoliang Sunney,|isbn=978-1-138-19952-1|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1062325706}}</ref>. CRS can also be used to image samples labeled with Raman Tags<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />, which normally has higher CRS signal than common bio-molecules have. CRS also find applications in other fields like material science and environmental sciences.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Principles energy levels.png|thumb|Energy diagrams of spontaneous and coherent Raman scatterings.]]\nCoherent Raman scattering is based on [[Raman scattering]] (or spontaneous Raman scattering). In spontaneous Raman, only one monochromatic excitation laser is used. Spontaneous Raman scattering's signal intensity grows linearly with the average power of a [[Continuous-wave laser|continuous wave pump laser]]. In CRS, two lasers are used to excite specific vibrational modes of molecules to be imaged.  The laser with a higher photon energy is normally called pump laser and the laser with a lower photon energy is called Stokes laser. Their photon energy differences match the energy of vibrational modes of molecules:\n\n<math>E_{Raman}=E_{pump}-E_{Stokes}</math>,\n\nwhere the <math>E_{Raman}=\\hbar \\Omega,\\ E_{pump}= \\hbar \\omega_{pump},\\ E_{Stokes}=\\hbar \\omega_{Stokes}</math>.\n\nCRS is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical process]], where the signal level is normally multiplication of powers of pump and Stokes lasers.

In the forward-detected SRS, the modulated laser is blocked by high optical density filter and the other laser is measured by a photodiode.

In epi-detected SRS, there are normally two methods to detect the SRS signal. One method is to detect the back scattered light in front of the objective by a photodiode with a hole at center. The other method is similar to the epi-detected CARS microscopy, where the back-scattered light went through the objective and deflected to the side of the light path normally with a combination of a polarizing beam splitter and a quarter wave-plate.

This can be achieved by image at different wavenumbers one after another. This operation always involves some type of tuning: tuning of laser's wavelength, tuning of spectral filtering device, or tuning of time delay between pump and Stokes lasers in the case of spectral-focusing CRS. Another way of doing multi-color CRS is to use one picosecond laser with a narrow spectral bandwidth (<1 nm) as pump or Stokes and the other laser with broad spectral bandwidth as Stokes or pump laser. In this case, the spectrum of transmitted broadband laser can be spread by a grating and measured by an array of detectors.  \n\n=== Spectral-focusing CRS ===\nCRS normally use lasers with narrow bandwidth lasers, whose bandwidth < 1 nm, to maintain good spectral resolution ~ 15 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

It takes a long time to scan the whole sample, since each pixel requires seconds for data acquisition. So the whole imaging process is long and therefore, it is more suitable for samples that do not move. CRS on the other hand measures signals at single wavenumber but allow fast scanning. If more spectral information is needed, multi-color or hyperspectral CRS can be used and the scanning speed or data quality will be compromised accordingly.\n\n== Comparison between SRS and CARS ==\nIn CRS microscopy, we can regard SRS and CARS as two aspects of the same process. CARS signal is always mixed with non-resonant four-wave mixing background and has a quadratic dependence on concentration of chemicals being imaged. SRS has much smaller background and depends linearly on the concentration of the chemical being imaged. Therefore, SRS is more suitable for quantitative imaging than CARS. On the instrument side, SRS requires modulation and lock-in detection. For multi-channel imaging, SRS will requires multichannel demodulation and CARS only need a PMT array or a camera. So the instrumentation is more complicated in SRS than CARS.  \n\nOn the sensitivity side, SRS and CARS normally provide similar sensitivities. Their differences are mainly due to detection methods. In CARS microscopy, PMT, APD or cameras are used as detectors to detect photons generated in the CARS process. PMT is most commonly used due to its large detection area and high speed. In SRS microscopy, photodiodes are normally used to measure the laser beams. Because of such differences, the application of CARS and SRS are also different.  \n\nPMT normally has relatively low [[quantum efficiency]] compared with photodiodes. This will negatively impact the SNR of CARS microscopy. PMT's also has reduced sensitivity for lasers with wavelength longer than 650 nm. Therefore, with the commonly used laser system for CRS, CARS is mainly used to image at high wavenumber region <math>(2800\\ cm^{-1}\\sim3400\\ cm^{-1})</math>. The SNR of CARS microscopy is normally poor for finger-print imaging <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.  \n\nSRS microscopy mainly use [[Photodiode|silicon photodiode]] as detectors. Si photodiodes have much higher quantum efficiency than PMT, that is one of the reasons that the SNR of SRS can be better than CARS in many cases. Si photodiodes also suffer reduced sensitivity when the wavelength of laser is longer than 850 nm. However, the sensitivity is still relatively high and allow for imaging in fingerprint region <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.    \n\n== See Also ==\n[[Raman scattering]]\n\n[[Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n[[Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy|CARS spectroscopy]]\n\n== References ==<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

In spontaneous Raman, only one monochromatic excitation laser is used. Spontaneous Raman scattering's signal intensity grows linearly with the average power of a [[Continuous-wave laser|continuous wave pump laser]]. In CRS, two lasers are used to excite specific vibrational modes of molecules to be imaged.  The laser with a higher photon energy is normally called pump laser and the laser with a lower photon energy is called Stokes laser. Their photon energy differences match the energy of vibrational modes of molecules:\n\n<math>E_{Raman}=E_{pump}-E_{Stokes}</math>,\n\nwhere the <math>E_{Raman}=\\hbar \\Omega,\\ E_{pump}= \\hbar \\omega_{pump},\\ E_{Stokes}=\\hbar \\omega_{Stokes}</math>.\n\nCRS is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical process]], where the signal level is normally multiplication of powers of pump and Stokes lasers. Therefore, most CRS microscopy experiments are performed with [[Pulsed laser|pulsed lasers]], where higher peak power improved the signal levels of CRS significantly.\n\n=== Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) Microscopy ===\n[[File:Forward and epi-detected CARS.tif|alt=|thumb|'''Forward and epi-detected CARS''']]\nIn CARS, photons generated in the anti-Stokes wavelength are being detected as signals.\n\n<math>E_{CARS}=E_{pump}+\\Omega=2\\times E_{pump}-E_{Stokes}</math>\n\nIn CARS microscopy, there are normally two ways to detect the newly generated photons.

In forward-detected CARS, the generated CARS photons together with pump and Stokes lasers go through the samples. The pump and Stokes lasers are completely blocked by a high [[Optical Density|optical density]] (OD) filter. The CARS photons are then detected by a [[Photomultiplier tube|photonmultiplier tube]] (PMT)  or a camera. In epi-detected CARS, back scattered CARS photons are redirected by a [[Dichroic filter|dichroic mirror]] or [[Polarizing beam splitter|polarizing beam splitter.]] After high OD filters are used to block back scattered pump and Stokes lasers, the newly generated photons are detected by a PMT. The signal intensity of CARS has the following relationship with the pump and Stokes laser's intensity <math>I^2_{pump}, I_{Stokes}</math>, the number of molecules <math>N</math> in the focus of the lasers and the third order Raman susceptibility <math>\\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman}</math> of the molecule:\n\n<math>I_{CARS}\\propto (N \\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman})^2 I^2_{pump} I_{Stokes}</math>\n\nThe [[Signal-to-noise ratio (imaging)|signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is a more important characteristic in imaging experiments are square root of the number of CARS photons generated, which is also given below:\n\n<math>\nSNR_{CARS}\\propto N \\chi ^{(3)} _{Raman} I_{pump} \\sqrt{I_{Stokes}}</math>\n\nThere are other non-linear optical processes that also generate photons at the anti-Stokes wavelength.

This can be achieved by image at different wavenumbers one after another. This operation always involves some type of tuning: tuning of laser's wavelength, tuning of spectral filtering device, or tuning of time delay between pump and Stokes lasers in the case of spectral-focusing CRS. Another way of doing multi-color CRS is to use one picosecond laser with a narrow spectral bandwidth (<1 nm) as pump or Stokes and the other laser with broad spectral bandwidth as Stokes or pump laser.

It takes a long time to scan the whole sample, since each pixel requires seconds for data acquisition. So the whole imaging process is long and therefore, it is more suitable for samples that do not move. CRS on the other hand measures signals at single wavenumber but allow fast scanning. If more spectral information is needed, multi-color or hyperspectral CRS can be used and the scanning speed or data quality will be compromised accordingly.\n\n== Comparison between SRS and CARS ==\nIn CRS microscopy, we can regard SRS and CARS as two aspects of the same process. CARS signal is always mixed with non-resonant four-wave mixing background and has a quadratic dependence on concentration of chemicals being imaged. SRS has much smaller background and depends linearly on the concentration of the chemical being imaged. Therefore, SRS is more suitable for quantitative imaging than CARS. On the instrument side, SRS requires modulation and lock-in detection. For multi-channel imaging, SRS will requires multichannel demodulation and CARS only need a PMT array or a camera. So the instrumentation is more complicated in SRS than CARS.  \n\nOn the sensitivity side, SRS and CARS normally provide similar sensitivities. Their differences are mainly due to detection methods. In CARS microscopy, PMT, APD or cameras are used as detectors to detect photons generated in the CARS process. PMT is most commonly used due to its large detection area and high speed. In SRS microscopy, photodiodes are normally used to measure the laser beams. Because of such differences, the application of CARS and SRS are also different.  \n\nPMT normally has relatively low [[quantum efficiency]] compared with photodiodes. This will negatively impact the SNR of CARS microscopy. PMT's also has reduced sensitivity for lasers with wavelength longer than 650 nm. Therefore, with the commonly used laser system for CRS, CARS is mainly used to image at high wavenumber region <math>(2800\\ cm^{-1}\\sim3400\\ cm^{-1})</math>. The SNR of CARS microscopy is normally poor for finger-print imaging <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.  \n\nSRS microscopy mainly use [[Photodiode|silicon photodiode]] as detectors. Si photodiodes have much higher quantum efficiency than PMT, that is one of the reasons that the SNR of SRS can be better than CARS in many cases. Si photodiodes also suffer reduced sensitivity when the wavelength of laser is longer than 850 nm. However, the sensitivity is still relatively high and allow for imaging in fingerprint region <math>(400\\ cm^{-1}\\sim1800\\ cm^{-1})</math>.    \n\n== See Also ==\n[[Raman scattering]]\n\n[[Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n[[Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy|CARS spectroscopy]]\n\n== References ==<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

They remarked there were problems between Liu and her mother, and the reporter learned that Liu \"worked in a nightclub, took money to keep men company\".<ref name=Pan/> According to David Ownby, a University of Montreal historian and expert on Falun Gong, Pan's portrayal of Liu Chunlin is highly inconsistent with the typical profile of a Falun Gong practitioner.<ref name=Ownby/>\n\nThe identities of participants on Tiananmen Square was also called into question by a CNN producer on the scene. While the Chinese government claimed that a 12-year-old Liu Siying had set herself on fire at the urging of her mother, the CNN producer said that she did not see any children among the self-immolators.<ref name=\"Schechter2001\"/>\n\nSeveral observers have noted that foreign journalists were not allowed to interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby.<ref>David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China''.

Every morning and night, the state-controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader, Li Hongzhi.\"<ref name=Pan/> Posters, leaflets and videos were produced, detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice.

In particular, it issued new, detailed instructions requiring that all who continued to actively practice Falun Gong were to be sent to prison or labour camps, and individuals who refused to renounce the practice were to be socially isolated and monitored by their families and workplaces. This was a shift from the past, when local officials sometimes tolerated Falun Gong on the condition that it was practised privately.<ref>Charles Hutzler, \"Falun Gong Feels Effect of China's Tighter Grip --- Shift Means Even Private Practice Is Banned,\" Asian Wall Street Journal, 26 April 2001.</ref> According to Freedom House, In the year following the incident, the scale of imprisonment, torture, and deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in custody increased significantly.

While state-run Xinhua News Agency had reported that Liu Chunling's adoptive mother spoke of Liu's \"obsession with Falun Gong\", her \"worshipping of Li Hongzhi\", and that Liu would teach her daughter Falun Gong,<ref>{{cite web |agency=Xinhua News Agency |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/7490.htm |title=Families of Falun Gong Victims After Tragedy |publisher=china.org.cn |date=1 February 2001}}</ref> Pan found most residents in Kaifeng felt disgraced by what Liu had done (i.e. the self-immolation), but none of Liu's neighbours had ever observed her practising Falun Gong. They remarked there were problems between Liu and her mother, and the reporter learned that Liu \"worked in a nightclub, took money to keep men company\".<ref name=Pan/> According to David Ownby, a University of Montreal historian and expert on Falun Gong, Pan's portrayal of Liu Chunlin is highly inconsistent with the typical profile of a Falun Gong practitioner.<ref name=Ownby/>\n\nThe identities of participants on Tiananmen Square was also called into question by a CNN producer on the scene. While the Chinese government claimed that a 12-year-old Liu Siying had set herself on fire at the urging of her mother, the CNN producer said that she did not see any children among the self-immolators.<ref name=\"Schechter2001\"/>\n\nSeveral observers have noted that foreign journalists were not allowed to interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby.<ref>David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China''. (Oxford University Press, 2008), p 217</ref> Pan wrote that \"Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized&nbsp;... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government.\"<ref name=Pan/> The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a [[tracheotomy]] shortly before the interview. Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the \"heavenly golden kingdom\";<ref name=mediachannel/> journalist [[Danny Schechter]] doubted that the child would have been able to speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.<ref name=\"Schechter2001\" />\n\nAccording to Schechter, Xinhua had unusually released a statement on the self-immolation to foreign media only hours after the event occurred, saying that this was unusual because sensitive subjects in the Chinese press are almost never reported on a timely basis.<ref name=mediachannel>{{cite web |first=Danny |last=Schechter |url=http://www.mediachannel.org/views/dissector/falungong2.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202162929/http://www.mediachannel.org/views/dissector/falungong2.shtml |archivedate=2 December 2002 |title=The Fires This Time: Immolation or Deception In Beijing? |publisher=Mediachannel |date=22 February 2001}}</ref> The usual protocol is approval by several party officials before publication, which usually takes a fair amount of time.<ref name=mulls/> Ian Johnson similarly observed the state media \"reported [the victim's] death with unusual alacrity, implying that either the death took place earlier than reported or the usually cautious media had top-level approval to rush out electronic reports and a televised dispatch.\"<ref name=mediachannel/>\n\nQuestions were also raised over where the footage of the event came from, and the speed with which camera crews appeared on scene. Chinese government media reported that the close-up shots in its video footage came from confiscated CNN tapes.<ref name=mulls /> CNN representatives argued that this was impossible, however, as their reporters were detained shortly after the event began and were not allowed to film the rest.

Every morning and night, the state-controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader, Li Hongzhi.\"<ref name=Pan/> Posters, leaflets and videos were produced, detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice.

In the kitchen awaits her two daughters and their father. The daughters and the father leave to go to his house, where his wife, Lorraine Farris, is preparing for her campaign to become counsellor. It is at this point, one sees a little inkling into the sinister character behind Dr. Farris.\n\nUpon his wife being elected counsellor, Dr. Farris can be seen as visibly disturbed by the relationship between his wife Loraine and her colleague. Shortly after that, his wife is seen as  becoming ill, with similar symptoms to that of his ex-wife. At this point, Ellen starts to become concerned for her health and pleads with her ex-husband to seek help for Lorraine, as he did, to find out the cause of her illness. At this point, from what Ellen is suffering is still unknown.\n\nAfter his wife suffers more serious episodes and his ex-wife again pleads with him, Dr. Farris takes their son (by Lorraine) Graham and her to Mexico to get her treated. On return, Ellen informs Dr. Farris and Lorraine that she found out she had [[selenium poisoning]] due to ingesting pure selenium (which is also found in some health supplements). Ellen then asks Lorraine to get tested for the same thing, which she promises to do. Dr Farris can also be seen throughout the movie to write a computerized journal about his personal life, which shows how distraught he is under his caring and loving persona.\n\nHowever, just 3 weeks later, Lorraine drops dead at home in front of Graham and is then quickly cremated by David. The pathologist initially is not able to find any signs of foul play except the faint smell of chlorine when he opened her up during autopsy. Dr. Farris has applied for a marriage license and subsequently gets married to a woman he met at his wife's election celebration. This course of action places a great level of suspicion on him. \nWith the help of his ex-wife, the police look into the conditions surrounding Lorraine's death, and after the examination of Ellen Farris further, they find out that she is suffering from kidney failure. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. It was also revealed that Lorraine died of cyanide poisoning, to which he switched after Mexico to speed up the effects of selenium (i.e. death) - it was initially missed due to a chlorine smell, and Dr. Farris was believed to have forced his wife to swallow a water supplement pill shortly before her death to mask the prominent smell of cyanide - hence the chlorine smell.\n\nThe motive behind these acts was jealousy and the desire to get rid of his wife; he poisoned his first wife to leave her for his second, Lorraine, with whom he was having an affair prior to their divorce and with whom he shared an apartment under her nose, and he did the same thing to Lorraine, to marry his third wife.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0212304}}\n\n[[Category:1999 television films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Lethal Vows\n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = {{hlist|Thriller|Drama}}\n| writer               = Michele Samit<br />Eric Edson<br />John Carlen<br />Dennis Nemec\n| director             = [[Paul Schneider (director)|Paul Schneider]]\n| starring             = [[John Ritter]]<br />[[Marg Helgenberger]]<br />[[Megan Gallagher]]\n| music                = [[Joseph Conlan]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| producer             = Dennis Nemec<br />Robert F.

It is thought that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew this [[self-portrait]] at about the age of 60. The portrait has been extensively reproduced and has become an iconic representation of Leonardo as a [[polymath]] or \"Renaissance Man\". Despite this, some historians and scholars disagree as to the true identity of the sitter.\n\n==Description and provenance==\nThe portrait is drawn in red chalk on paper. It depicts the head of an elderly man in three-quarter view, his face turned towards the viewer. The subject is distinguished by his long hair and long waving beard which flow over the shoulders and chest. The length of the hair and beard is uncommon in Renaissance portraits and suggests, as now, a person of sagacity. The face has a somewhat aquiline nose and is marked by deep lines on the brow and pouches below the eyes. It appears as if the man has lost his upper front teeth, causing deepening of the grooves from the nostrils. The eyes of the figure do not engage the viewer but gaze ahead, veiled by the long eyebrows.\n\nThe drawing has been drawn in fine unique lines, shadowed by hatching and executed with the left hand, as was Leonardo's habit. The paper has brownish \"fox marks\" caused by the accumulation of iron salts due to moisture. It is housed at the [[Royal Library of Turin|Royal Library]] (''Biblioteca Reale'') in [[Turin, Italy]], and is not generally viewable by the public due to its fragility and poor condition.<ref name=Finearts/>\nResearchers have developed a nondestructive way to gauge the condition of the drawing by describing and quantifying the [[chromophores]] affecting the paper. Their technique, described in ''[[Applied Physics Letters]]'' (2014), will be used to assess the rate at which the image is deteriorating and should help with planning appropriate conservation strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/104/22/10.1063/1.4879838|title=Visual degradation in Leonardo da Vinci's iconic self-portrait: A nanoscale study}}</ref>\n\n==History and attribution==\nThe drawing is estimated to have been drawn c. 1510, possibly as a self-portrait by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].
