It received 12 nominations for the [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards]], the most nominations of any eligible film, and eventually won the awards for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Adaptation|Best Adaptation]], [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. \n\n''An Officer and a Spy'' is Polanski's first film to be shot after he was expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] under the new \"ethical standards\" of the post-[[Me Too]] era. The director's perceived impunity in Europe made the release of the film, and the accolades it won in Italy and France, controversial.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centres on the notorious 19th century [[Dreyfus affair]]. [[Jean Dujardin]] stars as French officer [[Georges Picquart]]. After being appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]], service de renseignement militaire'') in 1895, he discovers that doctored evidence was used to convict [[Alfred Dreyfus]], one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff, of passing military secrets to the [[German Empire]]. Picquart risks his career and his life, struggling for a decade to expose the truth and liberate the wrongly convicted Dreyfus from the dreaded [[Devil's Island]] prison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jean Dujardin]] as [[Georges Picquart]]\n* [[Louis Garrel]] as [[Alfred Dreyfus]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Pauline Monnier\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as [[Alphonse Bertillon]]\n* [[Melvil Poupaud]] as [[Fernand Labori]]\n* Eric Ruf as [[Jean Sandherr]]\n* [[Laurent Stocker]] as [[Georges-Gabriel de Pellieux]]\n* [[Michel Vuillermoz]] as [[Armand du Paty de Clam]]\n* [[Denis Podalyd\u00e8s]] as [[Edgar Demange]]\n* [[Wladimir Yordanoff]] as [[Auguste Mercier]]\n* [[Didier Sandre]] as [[Raoul Le Mouton de Boisdeffre]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois]] as [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]]\n* [[Vincent Grass]] as [[Jean-Baptiste Billot]]\n* [[Herv\u00e9 Pierre]] as [[Charles-Arthur Gonse]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]] was inspired to write the [[An Officer and a Spy|novel]] by his friend Polanski's longtime interest in the [[Dreyfus affair]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/29/robert-harris-interview-officer-spy|title=Robert Harris: 'Whenever a crowd is running one way, I run the other'|first=Andrew|last=Anthony|date=29 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> Harris followed up the novel with a script of the same story, titled ''D'', with Polanski announced as director in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanski-dreyfus-affair-d-322555|title=Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D'|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis film marks the third time Harris has worked with Polanski.<ref name=\"Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D'\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanski-dreyfus-affair-d-322555 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Pamela | last=McClintock | title=Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D' | date=9 May 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513200703/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanski-dreyfus-affair-d-322555 | archivedate=13 May 2012 }}</ref> Harris previously co-wrote ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' with Polanski, which was also an adaptation of one of Harris's novels, ''[[The Ghost (Harris novel)|The Ghost]]''.

It received 12 nominations for the [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards]], the most nominations of any eligible film, and eventually won the awards for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Adaptation|Best Adaptation]], [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. \n\n''An Officer and a Spy'' is Polanski's first film to be shot after he was expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] under the new \"ethical standards\" of the post-[[Me Too]] era.

[[Jean Dujardin]] stars as French officer [[Georges Picquart]]. After being appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]], service de renseignement militaire'') in 1895, he discovers that doctored evidence was used to convict [[Alfred Dreyfus]], one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff, of passing military secrets to the [[German Empire]].

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, [[triceps]], and anterior [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or [[physical education]] and commonly in [[Military Fitness|military physical training]]. They are also a common form of [[punishment]] used in the military, school sport, or some [[martial arts]] disciplines.\n\n==Etymology== twich \nThe American English term ''push-up'' was first used between 1905 and 1910,<ref>{{cite web | title=push-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/push-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> while the British ''press-up'' was first recorded between 1945 and 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=press-up |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/press-upp |year=2006 |author= Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=press-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/press-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Body mass supported during push-ups==\nAccording to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their [[body mass]] in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where [[knees]] are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.<ref name=\"suprak\">{{cite journal|last1=Suprak|first1=David N|last2=Dawes|first2=Jay|last3=Stephenson|first3=Mark D|title=The Effect of Position on the Percentage of Body Mass Supported During Traditional and Modified Push-up Variants|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|date=February 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=497\u2013503|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bde2cf|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Dawes/publication/41548700_The_Effect_of_Position_on_the_Percentage_of_Body_Mass_Supported_During_Traditional_and_Modified_Push-up_Variants/links/549983200cf2d6581ab14a6d.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Muscles worked==\nWhile the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/41/push-up/ |title=Push-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>\n[[File: Marines do pushups.jpg|thumb|Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.]]\n\n=== Abdominals ===\nThe [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] and [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and [[torso]] aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.\n\n=== Deltoid ===\nThe anterior portion of the [[deltoid muscle]] is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the [[clavicle]] and [[scapula]], just above the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] on one end, and to the outside of the [[humerus bone]] on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.\n\n=== Chest muscles ===\nThe push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and the [[Pectoralis minor muscle|minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.md-health.com/What-Muscles-Do-Push-Ups-Work.html|title=What Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?|work=MDhealth.com}}</ref> These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.\n\n=== Stabilizers: back body ===\nThe push-up depends on stabilizer muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The [[Erector spinal muscles|erector spinae]] is the main stabilizer muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilizes the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.\n\n=== Triceps brachii ===\nWhile the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the [[triceps brachii]] muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads \u2014 the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/341958-which-muscles-does-a-push-up-work/|title=Which Muscles Does a Push-Up Work?|author=Matthew Schirm|work=Live Well - Jillian Michaels}}</ref>\nThere is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.\n\n=== Forearms ===\nStabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.\n\n=== Biceps ===\nDuring the push-up exercise, the short head of the [[biceps brachii]] muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends\u2014the elbow and the shoulder\u2014to help stabilize the joints.\n\n=== Joints and tendons ===\nInner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehealthsciencejournal.com/10-level-push-ups-series-building-ultimate-strength/|title=10 Level Push-ups Series for Building Ultimate Strength|author=Melissa Bell|work=www.thehealthsciencejournal.com |publisher=[[The Health Science Journal]] |accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the \"full push-up\", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a \"diamond push-up\") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the [[triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.\n===Weighted push-ups=== \nProgressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands (or any form of weight). The load is positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position.\n\n===Planche push-ups===\n[[Image:Planche.jpg|thumb|right|Planche position]]\nAn extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the [[Planche (exercise)|planche]] position. These are known as \"planche push-ups\". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.\n\n===Knuckle push-ups===\nAnother variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in [[martial arts]], such as [[Karate]] and [[Tae Kwon Do]], and may be used in boxing training while wearing [[boxing gloves]].\n\nThe intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical \"palms on floor\" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.\n\n===Maltese push-up===\nThe ''Maltese push-up'' is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the [[hip (anatomy)|hips]] (as opposed to roughly alongside the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]]), but with a wide distance between them.\n\n===Hindu push-up===\n{{see also|sun salutation}}\n[[File:Dand (Basic).gif|thumb|The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch.]]\nThe most basic form of ''Hindu push-up'' starts from the [[downward dog]] [[yoga]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a [[cobra pose]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a ''dand''. It is common in [[India]]n physical culture and [[Indian martial arts]], particularly [[Pehlwani]].<ref>Mujumdar D.C., ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture'', 1950, p.460, plate 131</ref> Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.<ref>Lee, Bruce,\n'Preliminaries' in ''The Tao of Jeet Kune Do'', California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29</ref> It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the [[anterior chain| anterior]] and [[posterior chain|posterior]] chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a [[Hanuman]], [[judo]], or dive-bomber push-up.\n\n===Guillotine push-up===\nThe ''guillotine push-up'' is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally [[medicine balls]]) wherein the practitioner lowers the [[chest]], [[human head|head]], and [[neck]] (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the [[shoulder]]s and put extra emphasis on the [[muscle]]s there.\n\n===Backhanded push-up===\nThe ''backhanded push-up'' is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grandcanyonnews.com/news/2010/feb/23/grand-canyon-record-breaker-does-it-again/|title=Grand Canyon record-breaker does it again - Grand Canyon News - Grand Canyon, Arizona|last=Whitehurst|first=Patrick|work=Grand Canyon News|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===One arm versions===\n[[File: US Army 52113 FORSCOM employee excels at fitness competition.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position.]]\nMany of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.\n\n===Single-leg push-up===\nLift one leg off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set.\n\n===Narrow-grip push-up===\nDo a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.\n\n===Wide-grip push-up===\nSimilar to a normal push-up but with wider spacing of the hands. This works the chest and shoulders more.\n\n===Clap push-up===\nAt the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest.\n\n===Spiderman push-up===\nDo a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep.\nAlso, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold.\n\n===Other versions===\nThere are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.\n\n\"Wall\" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall.\n\n\"Table\" or \"chair\" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.\n\n\"Modified\" or \"knee\" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition.\n\n\"Three-phase\" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.\n\n\"Diamond\" or \"Triceps\" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps.\n\n\"Hollow-Body\" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the \"hollow body\". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.\n\n===Plyometrics===\nTwo platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.\n\nAnother is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.\n\n'''Aztec push-ups'''\n\nThe Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups.  A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air.  While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes.  The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/|title=Bodyweight Exercises Periodic Table with How-To Videos|work=Strength Stack 52}}</ref>\n\n'''360 push ups'''\n\nThe 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mNQsPMuHQ|title=19 Variations of Push Up Exercises (The Best Chest Builders Ever!)|date=26 December 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n''' Falling and explosive rebound push ups'''<br />\nHere one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRaVsFn_g4|title=10-15 Crazy Extreme Push Ups - Calisthenics Street Workout 2013 (HD)|date=1 June 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nWith push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.\n\nPush-ups between chairs form an integral part of the \"Dynamic Tension\" Course devised by [[Charles Atlas]], and similar systems.\n\n==Record breakers and attempts==\n* The first record for push-ups documented by Guinness World Records was 6,006 non-stop push-ups by Charles Linster on 5 October 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|title=World Records for Non-Stop Push-Ups - Ulysses Yield|author=Ralf Laue and Charles Linster|work=recordholders.org}}</ref>\n* The record for the most push-ups non-stop was 10,507, set by Minoru Yoshida of Japan in October 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Record for Non-Stop Push-Ups|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|work=World Records for Push-Ups (Press-Ups)|publisher=The International World Record Breakers' Club|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> Yoshida's record was the last for non-stop push-ups to be published by Guinness World Records.

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, [[triceps]], and anterior [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or [[physical education]] and commonly in [[Military Fitness|military physical training]]. They are also a common form of [[punishment]] used in the military, school sport, or some [[martial arts]] disciplines.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe American English term ''push-up'' was first used between 1905 and 1910,<ref>{{cite web | title=push-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/push-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> while the British ''press-up'' was first recorded between 1945 and 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=press-up |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/press-upp |year=2006 |author= Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=press-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/press-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Body mass supported during push-ups==\nAccording to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their [[body mass]] in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where [[knees]] are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.<ref name=\"suprak\">{{cite journal|last1=Suprak|first1=David N|last2=Dawes|first2=Jay|last3=Stephenson|first3=Mark D|title=The Effect of Position on the Percentage of Body Mass Supported During Traditional and Modified Push-up Variants|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|date=February 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=497\u2013503|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bde2cf|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Dawes/publication/41548700_The_Effect_of_Position_on_the_Percentage_of_Body_Mass_Supported_During_Traditional_and_Modified_Push-up_Variants/links/549983200cf2d6581ab14a6d.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Muscles worked==\nWhile the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/41/push-up/ |title=Push-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>\n[[File: Marines do pushups.jpg|thumb|Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.]]\n\n=== Abdominals ===\nThe [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] and [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and [[torso]] aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.\n\n=== Deltoid ===\nThe anterior portion of the [[deltoid muscle]] is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the [[clavicle]] and [[scapula]], just above the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] on one end, and to the outside of the [[humerus bone]] on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.\n\n=== Chest muscles ===\nThe push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and the [[Pectoralis minor muscle|minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.md-health.com/What-Muscles-Do-Push-Ups-Work.html|title=What Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?|work=MDhealth.com}}</ref> These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.\n\n=== Stabilizers: back body ===\nThe push-up depends on stabilizer muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The [[Erector spinal muscles|erector spinae]] is the main stabilizer muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilizes the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.\n\n=== Triceps brachii ===\nWhile the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the [[triceps brachii]] muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads \u2014 the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/341958-which-muscles-does-a-push-up-work/|title=Which Muscles Does a Push-Up Work?|author=Matthew Schirm|work=Live Well - Jillian Michaels}}</ref>\nThere is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.\n\n=== Forearms ===\nStabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.\n\n=== Biceps ===\nDuring the push-up exercise, the short head of the [[biceps brachii]] muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends\u2014the elbow and the shoulder\u2014to help stabilize the joints.\n\n=== Joints and tendons ===\nInner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehealthsciencejournal.com/10-level-push-ups-series-building-ultimate-strength/|title=10 Level Push-ups Series for Building Ultimate Strength|author=Melissa Bell|work=www.thehealthsciencejournal.com |publisher=[[The Health Science Journal]] |accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the \"full push-up\", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a \"diamond push-up\") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the [[triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.\n===Weighted push-ups=== \nProgressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands (or any form of weight). The load is positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position.\n\n===Planche push-ups===\n[[Image:Planche.jpg|thumb|right|Planche position]]\nAn extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the [[Planche (exercise)|planche]] position. These are known as \"planche push-ups\". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.\n\n===Knuckle push-ups===\nAnother variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in [[martial arts]], such as [[Karate]] and [[Tae Kwon Do]], and may be used in boxing training while wearing [[boxing gloves]].\n\nThe intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical \"palms on floor\" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.\n\n===Maltese push-up===\nThe ''Maltese push-up'' is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the [[hip (anatomy)|hips]] (as opposed to roughly alongside the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]]), but with a wide distance between them.\n\n===Hindu push-up===\n{{see also|sun salutation}}\n[[File:Dand (Basic).gif|thumb|The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch.]]\nThe most basic form of ''Hindu push-up'' starts from the [[downward dog]] [[yoga]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a [[cobra pose]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a ''dand''. It is common in [[India]]n physical culture and [[Indian martial arts]], particularly [[Pehlwani]].<ref>Mujumdar D.C., ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture'', 1950, p.460, plate 131</ref> Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.<ref>Lee, Bruce,\n'Preliminaries' in ''The Tao of Jeet Kune Do'', California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29</ref> It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the [[anterior chain| anterior]] and [[posterior chain|posterior]] chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a [[Hanuman]], [[judo]], or dive-bomber push-up.\n\n===Guillotine push-up===\nThe ''guillotine push-up'' is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally [[medicine balls]]) wherein the practitioner lowers the [[chest]], [[human head|head]], and [[neck]] (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the [[shoulder]]s and put extra emphasis on the [[muscle]]s there.\n\n===Backhanded push-up===\nThe ''backhanded push-up'' is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grandcanyonnews.com/news/2010/feb/23/grand-canyon-record-breaker-does-it-again/|title=Grand Canyon record-breaker does it again - Grand Canyon News - Grand Canyon, Arizona|last=Whitehurst|first=Patrick|work=Grand Canyon News|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===One arm versions===\n[[File: US Army 52113 FORSCOM employee excels at fitness competition.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position.]]\nMany of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.\n\n===Single-leg push-up===\nLift one leg off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set.\n\n===Narrow-grip push-up===\nDo a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.\n\n===Wide-grip push-up===\nSimilar to a normal push-up but with wider spacing of the hands. This works the chest and shoulders more.\n\n===Clap push-up===\nAt the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest.\n\n===Spiderman push-up===\nDo a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep.\nAlso, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold.\n\n===Other versions===\nThere are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.\n\n\"Wall\" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall.\n\n\"Table\" or \"chair\" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.\n\n\"Modified\" or \"knee\" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition.\n\n\"Three-phase\" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.\n\n\"Diamond\" or \"Triceps\" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps.\n\n\"Hollow-Body\" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the \"hollow body\". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.\n\n===Plyometrics===\nTwo platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.\n\nAnother is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.\n\n'''Aztec push-ups'''\n\nThe Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups.  A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air.  While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes.  The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/|title=Bodyweight Exercises Periodic Table with How-To Videos|work=Strength Stack 52}}</ref>\n\n'''360 push ups'''\n\nThe 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mNQsPMuHQ|title=19 Variations of Push Up Exercises (The Best Chest Builders Ever!)|date=26 December 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n''' Falling and explosive rebound push ups'''<br />\nHere one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRaVsFn_g4|title=10-15 Crazy Extreme Push Ups - Calisthenics Street Workout 2013 (HD)|date=1 June 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nWith push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.\n\nPush-ups between chairs form an integral part of the \"Dynamic Tension\" Course devised by [[Charles Atlas]], and similar systems.\n\n==Record breakers and attempts==\n* The first record for push-ups documented by Guinness World Records was 6,006 non-stop push-ups by Charles Linster on 5 October 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|title=World Records for Non-Stop Push-Ups - Ulysses Yield|author=Ralf Laue and Charles Linster|work=recordholders.org}}</ref>\n* The record for the most push-ups non-stop was 10,507, set by Minoru Yoshida of Japan in October 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Record for Non-Stop Push-Ups|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|work=World Records for Push-Ups (Press-Ups)|publisher=The International World Record Breakers' Club|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> Yoshida's record was the last for non-stop push-ups to be published by Guinness World Records.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

The boundary between Harold Wood and Noak Hill was formed by a tributary of the [[River Ingrebourne]]. In the Harold Hill area the manor was subdivided into Dagnams, Cockerells and Gooshays. The Havering courts and Romford vestry were the principal local government in the area. The Havering liberty was abolished in 1892 and the vestry in 1894. Following the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the area was split between the parishes of Romford Rural (in the west) and Noak Hill (in the east), each with a [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] and within the [[Romford Rural District]]. In 1900 the Romford Rural parish was abolished and the area was then split between the [[Romford Urban District]] (in the west) and Noak Hill in Romford Rural District (in the east). In 1934 Romford Urban District absorbed Noak Hill, bringing the whole area under the authority of Romford Urban District Council. Romford was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1937 governed by Romford Borough Council, which was the local authority during the construction of the estate. The Municipal Borough of Romford was abolished in 1965 and Harold Hill became part of the [[London Borough of Havering]] in Greater London.\n\n===Urban development===\nHarold Hill was a planned community, conceived as part of the [[Greater London Plan]] in 1944 as a satellite town on the edge of the built up area.<ref group=\"notes\">[[New towns in the United Kingdom|New towns]] by contrast were planned to be further away from London and provide more diverse development.</ref> Land for the estate, which consisted of the remaining {{convert|850|acre|sqkm}} of [[Dagnam Park|Dagnams]], was purchased in 1947 by the London County Council.<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner (2005).

Reflecting the urgency of the problem, housing was initially prefabricated. Construction of 7,631 permanent homes, housing 25,000 people, began in 1948 and was complete by 1958. The development is fairly low density with large sections of parkland retained in the centre and edges of the estate.

In 1939 he established and lead the ''[[Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh]]'' (PUSA), or All Aceh Islamic Scholars Association. PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of ''[[ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang]]'' (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their [[Dutch East Indies campaign|1942 invasion]], in the hope of overturning ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' rule as a reward for their support. As the Japanese saw a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' to religious courts headed by Daud. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' and the killing of many in the [[Cumbok Affair]] of December 1945/January 1946. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949\u201350)|Indonesian Republic]]'s struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause. He was recognised as Military Governor in 1947, and Governor once independence was won in 1950.\n\nHe and his supporters were alienated from Jakarta thereafter. Daud was sidelined in favour of western-educated leaders in 1951 when Aceh was merged in a larger Province of [[North Sumatra]] with a substantial Christian ([[Batak]]) minority. Supported by former PUSA members and much of the military, he led a rebellion against Jakarta in September 1953, declaring that Aceh would join the insurgent ''[[Negara Islam Indonesia]]'' (Indonesian Islamic State) formed earlier in Java by [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo|Kartosuwiryo]]. Jakarta quickly retook the cities, but resistance was widespread until 1959, when many supporters accepted a peace agreement whereby Aceh would become a \"Special Region\" with the right to enact Islamic laws.

PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of ''[[ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang]]'' (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their [[Dutch East Indies campaign|1942 invasion]], in the hope of overturning ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' rule as a reward for their support. As the Japanese saw a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' to religious courts headed by Daud. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the ''ul\u00e8\u00ebbalang'' and the killing of many in the [[Cumbok Affair]] of December 1945/January 1946. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949\u201350)|Indonesian Republic]]'s struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause. He was recognised as Military Governor in 1947, and Governor once independence was won in 1950.\n\nHe and his supporters were alienated from Jakarta thereafter. Daud was sidelined in favour of western-educated leaders in 1951 when Aceh was merged in a larger Province of [[North Sumatra]] with a substantial Christian ([[Batak]]) minority. Supported by former PUSA members and much of the military, he led a rebellion against Jakarta in September 1953, declaring that Aceh would join the insurgent ''[[Negara Islam Indonesia]]'' (Indonesian Islamic State) formed earlier in Java by [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo|Kartosuwiryo]]. Jakarta quickly retook the cities, but resistance was widespread until 1959, when many supporters accepted a peace agreement whereby Aceh would become a \"Special Region\" with the right to enact Islamic laws. Daud himself did not return from his guerrilla base until 1962, however, when he was given an amnesty but remained very critical.<ref name=\"Reid341\">Reid (2005), p. 341</ref>\n\nAfter the appearance of [[Free Aceh Movement]] (GAM) in 1978, Beureueh was arrested and held under house arrest in Jakarta until his death in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/cara-orde-baru-membungkam-para-ulama-ckrP|title=Daud Beureueh Arrested|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Biography}}\n* {{cite book | last =Siegel | first =James | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Rope of God | publisher =University of California Press | year = 1969 | location = United States | pages = | isbn = }}\n* {{cite book | last =Reid | first =Anthony | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Blood of the People: Revolution and the End of Traditional Rule in Northern Sumatra | publisher =Singapore University Press | year = 1979 | location = [[Singapore]] | pages = | isbn = 9971696371}}\n* {{cite book | last =Reid | first =Anthony | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =An Indonesian Frontier: Acehnese & Other Histories of Sumatra | publisher =Singapore University Press | year = 2005 | location = Singapore | pages = | isbn = 9971-69-298-8}}\n{{authority control|VIAF=280425100}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beureueh, Daud}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:Acehnese people]]\n[[Category:Governors of Aceh]]\n[[Category:Indonesian military personnel]]\n[[Category:Indonesian Muslims]]\n[[Category:Indonesian prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:People from Pidie Jaya Regency]]\n[[Category:Politics of Aceh]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Aceh]]\n\n\n{{Indonesia-mil-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Vahurzpu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBibliography:Move authority control to Wikidata", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daud_Beureu%27eh"}

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

Stadium (Indiana)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. This marked the first time that the Buckeyes opened a season on the road since their 42\u201324 victory over [[2015 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] in [[2015 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2015]] and their first time opening with a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent since [[1976 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1976]] when they defeated [[1976 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] 49\u201321.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ohiostate.247sports.com/ContentGallery/Ohio-State-Buckeyes-football-will-open-on-road-in-Big-Ten-for-th-106464208|title=Ohio State Buckeyes football will open on road in Big Ten for third time ever|work=Bucknuts|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nOhio State began the game well, driving the ball 66 yards on 11 plays, but were stalled in the redzone, settling for a Sean Nuernberger field goal to take an early 3\u20130 lead. The Hoosiers answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Richard Lagow to tight end Ian Thomas to take a four-point lead. The teams continued to trade punts until the second quarter when the Buckeyes' Jordan Fuller intercepted an Indiana pass in the endzone. Ohio State mounted a 58-yard drive that ended came up short at Indiana two-yard line that resulted in another Nuernberger field goal to bring the score to 7\u20136. Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes held on for the win, 49\u201321.\n\nTwo Buckeye records were set during the game: J.K. Dobbins broke [[Maurice Clarett]]'s 2002 debut rushing performance of 175 yards by amassing 181 yards on the ground,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400935229|title=Ohio State vs. Indiana \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 August 31, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref> and [[J.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K. Dobbins touchdown, giving the Buckeyes a 10\u20133 lead. But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10. Ohio State would never find the endzone again and would settle for two more Nuernberger field goals.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown.

This was Ohio State's Homecoming game. The Buckeyes have continued their undefeated streak over the Terrapins by winning by an average of 39 points.\n\nThe heavily favored Buckeyes began the game with a 9-play, 70-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run.  On the Terrapins first drive, Quarterback Max Bortenschlager, was hit from behind by DE Nick Bosa and fumbled the ball which was returned by LB Jerome Baker for a 20-yard touchdown to give the Buckeyes an early 14\u20130 lead. The Buckeyes' special teams woes began on the ensuing kickoff which was returned for a 100-yard touchdown by Ty Johnson to cut the Ohio State lead to 7. But, the Ohio State offense answered again by scoring an 8-yard touchdown pass from Barrett to Benjimin Victor. Following a botched PAT snap, the Buckeyes lead 20\u20137 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe Buckeyes' miscues began adding up at the beginning of the second quarter. Sean Nuernberger's 47-yard field goal was blocked, [[J. K. Dobbins]] fumbled and punter Drue Chrisman had a 22-yard punt giving Maryland great field position. Though the mistakes on special teams and offense added up, the defense kept the Maryland offense scoreless. In the final five minutes of the second half, Ohio State scored three consecutive touchdowns giving them a 41\u20137 halftime lead.\n\nMaryland began the second half with a \u221214 yard drive that was followed by an Ohio State drive that ended with a missed 29-yard field goal attempt. The Ohio State offense recovered and scored touchdowns on three of their next four drives. Maryland's only offensive score of the day came after a Dwayne Haskins fumble at the Ohio State 27, which allowed for a four play drive, capped by a 20-yard Javon Leake run, making the final 62\u201314.\n\nOhio State finished the day with 584 total yards and held the Terrapins to only 66.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|584\n|66\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|303\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|281\n|50\n|-\n|Penalties\n|8\u201385\n|6\u201366\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|32:24\n|27:36\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

This is the third consecutive defeat of their cross-divisional foe, with the last and only loss coming in 2011. Additionally, the win marked the Buckeye's 500th [[Big Ten Conference]] victory and moved them into a tie with the Cornhuskers for the third-most [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] wins at 892.\n\nThe Buckeyes began the game on defense which forced a three-and-out. Following a 57-yard punt which pinned the Ohio State offense at their own 4-yard line, the Buckeye's drove 96 yards to score the game's first score that was capped by a 52-yard, [[J. K. Dobbins]], touchdown.  After another three-and-out by the Silver Bullet defense, the offense again scored on another drive that ended with a [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run, giving the Buckeyes a 14\u20130 lead at the end of the opening quarter. Ohio State scored less than 90 seconds into the second quarter, increasing their lead to 21. The Nebraska offense showed very little in the first half, gaining only five first downs on their six possessions, and the defense struggled even more by failing to stop the Buckeyes from reaching the endzone on all five of their possessions. This gave Ohio State a 35\u20130 halftime lead.\n\nOhio State once again lead a 75-yard drive to open the second half but were quickly matched by a 77-yard [[Tanner Lee]] touchdown pass to J.D. Spielman, making the score 42\u20137 Ohio State. The Cornhuskers would once again score on their following possession, on another Tanner Lee pass, but the score was again matched on a 15-play, 66-yard, Ohio State scoring drive. Nebraska would fail to score again while Ohio State would score once more, making the final score 56\u201314. Ohio State would score on eight of their nine drives and never having to punt.\n\n[[J. T.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State. Iowa quarterback, [[Nate Stanley]], was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|371\n|487\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|208\n|244\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|243\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201395\n|5\u201334\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:09\n|34:51\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

OSU coach [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 4\u20132 versus the Spartans, while MSU coach [[Mark Dantonio]] fell to 3\u20136 against the Buckeyes. With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T. Barrett]] was able to rush for two more touchdowns as well as pass for another to give them a 28\u20130 lead. The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory. This result was the largest defeat in the series history.\n\nThe Buckeyes moved up three spots to No. 8 in both the AP and Coaches' polls and four spots to No. 9 in the CFP poll while Michigan State fell to No. 24 in the AP poll, No. 22 in the Coaches' poll and No. 17 in the CFP poll.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6. It was announced on December 3, that No. 5 Ohio State would face No. 8 USC in the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|449\n|298\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|211\n|238\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|238\n|60\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201348\n|6\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:65\n|34:06\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively. Barrett also passed [[Drew Brees]] for the Big Ten record of most offensive yards in a career.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|277\n|413\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|114\n|356\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|57\n|-\n|Penalties\n|3\u201330\n|3\u201335\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|4\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:04\n|34:56\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes held on for the win, 49\u201321.\n\nTwo Buckeye records were set during the game: J.K. Dobbins broke [[Maurice Clarett]]'s 2002 debut rushing performance of 175 yards by amassing 181 yards on the ground,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400935229|title=Ohio State vs. Indiana \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 August 31, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref> and [[J.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K.

But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown. Another three-and-out gave OSU the ball back with 4:36 remaining, and backup QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. guided the offense 72 yards before the time arrived for victory formation.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|586\n|278\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|316\n|19\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|270\n|259\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201355\n|2\u201322\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|23:03\n|36:57\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

This was Ohio State's Homecoming game. The Buckeyes have continued their undefeated streak over the Terrapins by winning by an average of 39 points.\n\nThe heavily favored Buckeyes began the game with a 9-play, 70-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run.  On the Terrapins first drive, Quarterback Max Bortenschlager, was hit from behind by DE Nick Bosa and fumbled the ball which was returned by LB Jerome Baker for a 20-yard touchdown to give the Buckeyes an early 14\u20130 lead. The Buckeyes' special teams woes began on the ensuing kickoff which was returned for a 100-yard touchdown by Ty Johnson to cut the Ohio State lead to 7. But, the Ohio State offense answered again by scoring an 8-yard touchdown pass from Barrett to Benjimin Victor. Following a botched PAT snap, the Buckeyes lead 20\u20137 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe Buckeyes' miscues began adding up at the beginning of the second quarter.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State. Iowa quarterback, [[Nate Stanley]], was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|371\n|487\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|208\n|244\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|243\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201395\n|5\u201334\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:09\n|34:51\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T.

The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

Urban Meyer is now 5\u20130 versus the Badgers, with two of the victories coming in overtime. [[Paul Chryst]] fell to 0\u20132 versus the Buckeyes. This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6. It was announced on December 3, that No. 5 Ohio State would face No. 8 USC in the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|449\n|298\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|211\n|238\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|238\n|60\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201348\n|6\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:65\n|34:06\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively. Barrett also passed [[Drew Brees]] for the Big Ten record of most offensive yards in a career.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|277\n|413\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|114\n|356\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|57\n|-\n|Penalties\n|3\u201330\n|3\u201335\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|4\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:04\n|34:56\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.
