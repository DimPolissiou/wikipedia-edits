This can be done by viewing the traffic statistics found in the web server log file, an automatically generated list of all the pages served. A ''hit'' is generated when any file is served. The page itself is considered a file, but images are also files, thus a page with 5 images could generate 6 hits (the 5 images and the page itself). A ''[[page view]]'' is generated when a visitor requests any page within the website&nbsp;\u2013 a visitor will always generate at least one page view (the main page) but could generate many more.\n[[Web tracking|Tracking]] applications external to the website can record traffic by inserting a small piece of [https://jobonlinelist.com/ HTML] code in every page of the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-mwt1/|title=Measuring Web Traffic|last=Malacinski|first=Andrei|author2=Dominick, Scott|author3=Hartrick, Tom|date=1 March 2001|publisher=IBM|accessdate=10 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719075253/http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-mwt1/|archive-date=19 July 2008|url-status=dead}}|</ref>\n\nWeb traffic is also sometimes measured by [[Packet sniffer|packet sniffing]] and thus gaining random samples of traffic data from which to extrapolate information about web traffic as a whole across total [[Internet]] usage.\n\nThe following types of information are often collated when monitoring [https://jobonlinelist.com/ web traffic]:\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalanalyticsassociation.org/Files/PDF_standards/WebAnalyticsDefinitionsVol1.pdf|title=Web Analytics Definitions|author = |publisher = Web Analytics Association|date = 22 September 2008|accessdate = 18 May 2015}}</ref>\n*The number of visitors.\n*The average number of page views per visitor&nbsp;\u2013 a high number would indicate that the average visitors go deep inside the site, possibly because they like it or find it useful.\n*Average visit duration&nbsp;\u2013 the total length of a user's visit.

The difficulty with this is that it does not look at the complete traffic picture for a site. Large sites usually hire the services of companies such as the [[Nielsen NetRatings]] or [[Quantcast]], but their reports are available only by subscription.\n\n==Control==\n\nThe amount of [https://jobonlinelist.com/ traffic] seen by a website is a measure of its popularity. By analysing the statistics of visitors it is possible to see shortcomings of the site and look to improve those areas. It is also possible to increase the popularity of a site and the number of people that visit it.\n\n===Limiting access===\n\nIt is sometimes important to protect some parts of a site by password, allowing only authorized people to visit particular sections or pages.\n\nSome site administrators have chosen to block their page to specific traffic, such as by geographic location. The [[political campaign|re-election campaign]] site for [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] ([http://www.georgewbush.com GeorgeWBush.com]) was blocked to all [[internet]] users outside of the U.S. on 25 October 2004 after a reported attack on the site.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/10/26/bush_campaign_web_site_rejects_nonus_visitors.html\n | title = Bush Campaign Web Site Rejects Non-US Visitors\n | first = Rich\n | last = Miller\n | date = 2004-10-26\n }}\n</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to limit access to a web server both based on the number of connections and by the bandwidth expended by each connection. On [[Apache HTTP server]]s, this is accomplished by the ''limitipconn'' module and others.\n\n===From search engines===\n\nThe majority of website traffic is driven by the [[Web search engines|search engines]].  Millions of people use search engines every day to research various topics, buy products, and go about their daily surfing activities. Search engines use [[Index term|keywords]] to help users find relevant information, and each of the major search engines has developed a unique [[algorithm]] to determine where websites are placed within the search results. When a user clicks on one of the listings in the search results, they are directed to the corresponding website and data is transferred from the website's server, thus counting the visitors towards the overall flow of traffic to that website.\n\n[[Search engine optimization]] (SEO), is the ongoing practice of optimizing a website to help improve its rankings in the search engines.  Several internal and external factors are involved which can help improve a site's listing within the search engines.  The higher a site ranks within the search engines for a particular keyword, the more traffic they will receive.\n\n===Increasing traffic===\n\nWeb traffic can be increased by placement of a site in search engines and purchase of [[advertising]], including bulk e-mail, [[pop-up ads]], and in-page advertisements. \n\nWeb traffic can also be increased by purchasing through web traffic providers who are experts at delivering targeted traffic, however, buying traffic in the past has seen many websites being penalized on search engines.\n\nWeb traffic can be increased not only by attracting more visitors to a site, but also by encouraging individual visitors to \"linger\" on the site, viewing many pages in a visit. (''see [[Outbrain]] for an example of this practice'')\n\nIf a web page is not listed in the first pages of any search, the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly (especially if there is other competition on the first page). Very few people go past the first page, and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower. Consequently, getting proper placement on search engines, a practice known as SEO, is as important as the website itself..{{cn|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Traffic overload==<!-- This section is linked from [[Slashdot effect]] -->\n\nToo much web traffic can dramatically slow down or prevent all access to a website. This is caused by more file requests going to the server than it can handle and may be an intentional attack on the site or simply caused by over-popularity. Large-scale websites with numerous servers can often cope with the traffic required, and it is more likely that smaller services are affected by traffic overload. Sudden traffic load may also hang your server or may result in a shutdown of your services.\n\n===Denial of service attacks===\n\n[[Denial-of-service attack]]s (DoS attacks) have forced websites to close after a malicious attack, flooding the site with more requests than it could cope with. [[Computer virus|Viruses]] have also been used to coordinate large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html|title=Denial of Service|publisher=Cert.org|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Sudden popularity===\n{{See also|Slashdot effect|Flash crowd}}\n\nA sudden burst of publicity may accidentally cause a web traffic overload.

In accordance with the [[Constitution of India]], the [[Governors of states of India|governor]] is a state's ''[[de jure]]'' head, but ''[[de facto]]'' executive authority rests with the [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]]. Following elections to the [[Rajasthan Legislative Assembly]], the [[Governor of Rajasthan|state's governor]] usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the [[Government of Rajasthan|government]]. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose [[Cabinet (government)|council of ministers]] are [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collectively responsible]] to the assembly. Given the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no [[term limit]]s.<ref>[[Durga Das Basu]].

As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 10, he had \"an intense spiritual experience\" that led to his becoming a devout [[Christians|Christian]]. \"I wore this big cross around my neck,\" he would recall, \"It was very real to me.\"<ref name=\"long\">{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Jim|title=Michael W.

After graduating from high school, he gravitated toward alcohol and drugs.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> He attended [[Marshall University]] while developing his songwriting skills but dropped out after one semester. He also played with various local bands around [[Huntington, West Virginia]]. During that time, his friend [[Shane Keister]], who worked as a session musician in Nashville, encouraged him to move to Nashville, the Country Music capital, and pursue a career in music.<ref name=\"long\" />\n\nIn 1978, Smith moved to Nashville, taking a job as a landscaper to support himself. He played with several local bands in the Nashville club scene. He also developed a problem with substance abuse.\n\n{{quote|I really started losing touch when I moved to Nashville, around April of '78. I was smokin' marijuana, drinking, doing some other drugs; just being crazy, you know. My mom and dad knew what I was doing. But they never hassled me; they just prayed for me. And I felt convicted by God. Every time I'd wake up I knew: This isn't me. But I couldn't change myself.<ref name=\"long\" />}}\n\nIn November 1979, Smith suffered a breakdown that led to his recommitment to Christianity. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, \"I Am\". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches, that Smith was finally able to put the drugs and alcohol behind him.<ref name=\"long\" />\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Beginning, MOR and Christian rock era (1981\u20131989) ===\nIn 1981, while he was playing keyboards for Higher Ground,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Michael W.|title=It's Time To Be Bold|date=2003|publisher=Thomas Nelson}}</ref> Smith was signed as a writer to Meadowgreen Music, where he wrote numerous [[gospel music|gospel]] hits penned for artists such as [[Sandi Patty]], [[Kathy Troccoli]], [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and [[Amy Grant]], to the effect that some of these popular worship songs can now be found in church [[hymnals]]. The following year, Smith began touring as a keyboardist for Grant on her ''[[Age to Age]]'' tour.\n\nHe would eventually become Grant's opening act and recorded his first [[Grammy]]-nominated solo album ''[[The Michael W. Smith Project]]'' (which he also produced himself) in 1983 on the [[Reunion Records]] label. This album contained the first recording of his hit \"Friends\", which he co-wrote with his wife Deborah. By the time Smith's second album ''[[Michael W. Smith 2]]'' was released in 1984, he was headlining his own tours. In 1986, Smith released ''[[The Big Picture (Michael W.

''[[Live the Life]]'' (1998) and ''[[This Is Your Time (Michael W. Smith album)|This Is Your Time]]'' (1999) follow the same style. In 1998, Smith also released his second Christmas album, ''[[Christmastime (Michael W.

The title track rose to No. 1 on the Radio & Records Charts and a music video for the song was released. The album combines the pop style of his previous recordings with the religious feel of his two live worship albums.  It was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album]]. In 2006 he released ''[[Stand (Michael W. Smith album)|Stand]]'', which is similar to ''Healing Rain'' (2004) in style and genre but with more Christian-themed songs. Also in 2006, Smith did the score and soundtrack to the film ''[[The Second Chance]]'', which he also starred in. He also released a single from the soundtrack album, \"All in the Serve\".\n\nIn October 2007, he released his third Christmas album, ''[[It's a Wonderful Christmas]]''. On June 20, 2008, Smith recorded his third live Worship album at the [[Lakewood Church]] in [[Houston, Texas]], titled ''[[A New Hallelujah]]''. It was released in October 2008.

He claimed that a show \"conflated with prayer and worship\" should remain in church or private property, not in the \"public's backyard\". The following day the city council decided to cancel the concert, but a day later they decided to host the show as planned after all, following a criticism from a Utah evangelical group that equated cancelling the concert to an assault on religious liberty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian concert in Draper on again despite lawsuit threat|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54512569-78/concert-draper-walker-money.html.csp|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The Mayor of Draper and several city council members were present at the event and were recognized for their support.\n\n[[File:Michael_W._Smith_in_June_2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Michael W.

His father was an oil refinery worker at the Ashland Oil Refinery, in nearby [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]]. His mother was a caterer.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2400/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Michael W.

As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 10, he had \"an intense spiritual experience\" that led to his becoming a devout [[Christians|Christian]]. \"I wore this big cross around my neck,\" he would recall, \"It was very real to me.\"<ref name=\"long\">{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Jim|title=Michael W. Smith Looks Back|journal=Christianity Today|date=March 1988|volume=46|issue=8|page=56}}</ref> He became involved in Bible study and found a group of older friends who shared his faith.<ref name=\"long\" />\n\nAfter his older Christian friends moved away to college, Smith began to struggle with feelings of loneliness and alienation. After graduating from high school, he gravitated toward alcohol and drugs.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> He attended [[Marshall University]] while developing his songwriting skills but dropped out after one semester. He also played with various local bands around [[Huntington, West Virginia]]. During that time, his friend [[Shane Keister]], who worked as a session musician in Nashville, encouraged him to move to Nashville, the Country Music capital, and pursue a career in music.<ref name=\"long\" />\n\nIn 1978, Smith moved to Nashville, taking a job as a landscaper to support himself. He played with several local bands in the Nashville club scene. He also developed a problem with substance abuse.\n\n{{quote|I really started losing touch when I moved to Nashville, around April of '78. I was smokin' marijuana, drinking, doing some other drugs; just being crazy, you know. My mom and dad knew what I was doing. But they never hassled me; they just prayed for me. And I felt convicted by God. Every time I'd wake up I knew: This isn't me. But I couldn't change myself.<ref name=\"long\" />}}\n\nIn November 1979, Smith suffered a breakdown that led to his recommitment to Christianity. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, \"I Am\". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches, that Smith was finally able to put the drugs and alcohol behind him.<ref name=\"long\" />\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Beginning, MOR and Christian rock era (1981\u20131989) ===\nIn 1981, while he was playing keyboards for Higher Ground,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Michael W.|title=It's Time To Be Bold|date=2003|publisher=Thomas Nelson}}</ref> Smith was signed as a writer to Meadowgreen Music, where he wrote numerous [[gospel music|gospel]] hits penned for artists such as [[Sandi Patty]], [[Kathy Troccoli]], [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and [[Amy Grant]], to the effect that some of these popular worship songs can now be found in church [[hymnals]]. The following year, Smith began touring as a keyboardist for Grant on her ''[[Age to Age]]'' tour.\n\nHe would eventually become Grant's opening act and recorded his first [[Grammy]]-nominated solo album ''[[The Michael W. Smith Project]]'' (which he also produced himself) in 1983 on the [[Reunion Records]] label. This album contained the first recording of his hit \"Friends\", which he co-wrote with his wife Deborah. By the time Smith's second album ''[[Michael W. Smith 2]]'' was released in 1984, he was headlining his own tours. In 1986, Smith released ''[[The Big Picture (Michael W. Smith album)|The Big Picture]]''.\n\nAfter the release of his 1988 effort, ''[[i 2 (EYE)]]'', Smith once again collaborated with Grant for her \"Lead Me On\" world tour. The following year, Smith recorded his first [[Christmas]] album, simply titled ''[[Christmas (Michael W. Smith album)|Christmas]]'' (1989).\n\n=== Mainstream venture and inspirational pop albums (1990\u20131999) ===\n\n[[File:Graham Crusade Smith.JPG|thumb|Michael W. Smith and [[Toby Mac]] with evangelist [[Billy Graham]] in 1994]]\nIn 1990, Smith released ''[[Go West Young Man (Michael W. Smith album)|Go West Young Man]]'', his first mainstream effort, which included the mainstream [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit single \"[[Place in This World]]\". The song peaked at No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 1992, he released ''[[Change Your World (Michael W. Smith album)|Change Your World]]'', which included the No. 1 adult contemporary hit \"[[I Will Be Here for You]]\". In 1993 Smith released his first box set, ''[[The Wonder Years (Michael W. Smith box set)|The Wonder Years]]'' and his first greatest hits album, ''[[The First Decade (1983\u20131993)]]''. The latter also includes two new songs, \"Do You Dream of Me?\" and \"Kentucky Rose\".\n\nIn 1994, Smith appeared as a guest pianist on the album ''[[Swing, Swang, Swung]]'' by [[Christian rock]] band [[Guardian (band)|Guardian]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=[[Swing, Swang, Swung]] |others=[[Guardian (band)|Guardian]] |year=1994 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Myrrh |id=7012529261 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Smith released his eighth album ''[[I'll Lead You Home]]'', which combines the pop style of his secular albums with a touch of religious feel. ''[[Live the Life]]'' (1998) and ''[[This Is Your Time (Michael W. Smith album)|This Is Your Time]]'' (1999) follow the same style. In 1998, Smith also released his second Christmas album, ''[[Christmastime (Michael W. Smith album)|Christmastime]]''.\n\nSmith collaborated with [[Jim Brickman]] on \"Love of My Life\", a romantic love song for Brickman's album ''Destiny'' in 1999. The song went to chart at No. 9 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. Also in 1999, he became the first Christian artist to receive the [[ASCAP]] \"Golden Note\" Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting.<ref name=goldennote /><ref>{{cite news|title=Greater Cincinnati \u2013 Northern Kentucky Mission|url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/billygraham/guests.html|newspaper=Cincinnati.com|accessdate=May 21, 2015|quote=He is also the first Christian artist to receive the ASCAP \"Golden Note\" Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting}}</ref>\n\n=== Instrumental and live worship albums (2000\u20132003) ===\n\nNearly all of Smith's albums include at least one instrumental track, and in 2000, Smith recorded his first all instrumental album, ''[[Freedom (Michael W.

This album was followed by a sequel, ''[[Worship Again]]'' in 2002. Both albums were recorded live in concert. ''Worship Again'' also includes a song that Smith wrote called \"There She Stands\", inspired by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. He performed this song live for the 2004 [[Republican National Convention]],<ref name=\"ccm1 \">{{cite journal| last=Croteau | first=Roberta | title =Ready for His Close-up |journal=[[CCM Magazine]]| date=December 2004|url =http://www.ccmmagazine.com/search/11535181/ |accessdate= August 15, 2009}}</ref> saying that President [[George W.

Smith.jpg|thumb|Michael W. Smith during a concert in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 2005]]\nSmith's album, ''[[Healing Rain]]'', was released in 2004 and debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 200 Chart. The title track rose to No. 1 on the Radio & Records Charts and a music video for the song was released. The album combines the pop style of his previous recordings with the religious feel of his two live worship albums.  It was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album]]. In 2006 he released ''[[Stand (Michael W. Smith album)|Stand]]'', which is similar to ''Healing Rain'' (2004) in style and genre but with more Christian-themed songs. Also in 2006, Smith did the score and soundtrack to the film ''[[The Second Chance]]'', which he also starred in. He also released a single from the soundtrack album, \"All in the Serve\".\n\nIn October 2007, he released his third Christmas album, ''[[It's a Wonderful Christmas]]''. On June 20, 2008, Smith recorded his third live Worship album at the [[Lakewood Church]] in [[Houston, Texas]], titled ''[[A New Hallelujah]]''. It was released in October 2008. That same month he began a tour with [[Steven Curtis Chapman]]. In September 2010, he released ''[[Wonder (Michael W.

Smith album)|Glory]]'', was released on November 22, 2011. Unlike his first instrumental album, ''Freedom'' (2000), this album features a 65-piece orchestra at\n[[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios Lyndhurts Hall]] in London and Wildwood Recording Studio in Nashville.<ref name=\"cduniverse\">{{cite web|title=Glory|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8622747 |publisher=CD Universe|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref> The following year he released his third compilation album, ''[[Decades of Worship]]'' (2012).\n\nSmith's concert in Draper, Utah, on July 24, 2012 was almost canceled due to a complaint filed by a Utah resident on July 16, 2012. He claimed that a show \"conflated with prayer and worship\" should remain in church or private property, not in the \"public's backyard\". The following day the city council decided to cancel the concert, but a day later they decided to host the show as planned after all, following a criticism from a Utah evangelical group that equated cancelling the concert to an assault on religious liberty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian concert in Draper on again despite lawsuit threat|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54512569-78/concert-draper-walker-money.html.csp|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The Mayor of Draper and several city council members were present at the event and were recognized for their support.\n\n[[File:Michael_W._Smith_in_June_2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Michael W.
