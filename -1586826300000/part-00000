The abdomen of the dancer appears blurred because of the rapid motion from side to side.]]\nA waggle dance consists of one to 100 or more circuits, each of which consists of two phases: the waggle phase and the return phase. A worker bee's waggle dance involves running through a small figure-eight pattern: a waggle run (aka waggle phase) followed by a turn to the right to circle back to the starting point (aka return phase), another waggle run, followed by a turn and circle to the left, and so on in a regular alternation between right and left turns after waggle runs. Waggle-dancing bees produce and release two [[alkanes]], tricosane and pentacosane, and two [[alkenes]], [[(Z)-9-Tricosene|(''Z'')-9-tricosene]] and (''Z'')-9-pentacosene, onto their abdomens and into the air.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom C, Gilley DC, Hooper J, Esch HE | title = The scent of the waggle dance | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e228 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17713987 | pmc = 1994260 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 }}</ref>\n\nThe direction and duration of waggle runs are closely correlated with the direction and distance of the resource being advertised by the dancing bee.

The more excited the bee is about the location, the more rapidly it will waggle, so it will grab the attention of the observing bees, and try to convince them. If multiple bees are doing the waggle dance, it's a competition to convince the observing bees to follow their lead, and competing bees may even disrupt other bees' dances or fight each other off. In addition, some open-air nesting honeybees such as the [[black dwarf honeybee]] (''Apis andreniformis''), whose nests hang from twigs or branches, will perform a horizontal dance on a stage above their nest in order to signal to resources.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raffiudin R, Crozier RH | title = Phylogenetic analysis of honey bee behavioral evolution | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 543\u201352 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17123837 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.10.013 }}</ref>\n\nWaggle dancing bees that have been in the nest for an extended time adjust the angles of their dances to accommodate the changing direction of the sun.

Miniswarms of foragers are not placed under the same selection pressure as are true swarms, because the fate of the entire colony is not at stake. A truly swarming colony has to be quickly led to a new home, or it will perish.

Bees emit constant and modulated electric fields during the waggle dance. Both low- and high-frequency components emitted by dancing bees induce passive antennal movements in stationary bees according to [[Coulomb's Law]]. The electrically charged [[flagellum]] of [[mechanoreceptor]] cells are moved by electric fields and more strongly so if sound and electric fields interact. Recordings from [[axons]] of the [[Johnston's organ]] indicate its sensitivity to electric fields. Therefore, it has been suggested that electric fields emanating from the surface charge of bees stimulate mechanoreceptors and may play a role in social communication during the waggle dance.<ref name=Greggers>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greggers U, Koch G, Schmidt V, D\u00fcrr A, Floriou-Servou A, Piepenbrock D, G\u00f6pfert MC, Menzel R | display-authors = 6 | title = Reception and learning of electric fields in bees | journal = Proceedings.

Bees emit constant and modulated electric fields during the waggle dance. Both low- and high-frequency components emitted by dancing bees induce passive antennal movements in stationary bees according to [[Coulomb's Law]]. The electrically charged [[flagellum]] of [[mechanoreceptor]] cells are moved by electric fields and more strongly so if sound and electric fields interact. Recordings from [[axons]] of the [[Johnston's organ]] indicate its sensitivity to electric fields. Therefore, it has been suggested that electric fields emanating from the surface charge of bees stimulate mechanoreceptors and may play a role in social communication during the waggle dance.<ref name=Greggers>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greggers U, Koch G, Schmidt V, D\u00fcrr A, Floriou-Servou A, Piepenbrock D, G\u00f6pfert MC, Menzel R | display-authors = 6 | title = Reception and learning of electric fields in bees | journal = Proceedings.

In tropical habitats, however, honey bee foraging is severely impaired if waggle dancing is prevented. This difference is thought to be due to the patchiness of resources in tropical environment versus the homogeneity of resources in temperate environments. In the tropics, food resources can come in the form of flowering trees which are rich in nectar but are scattered sparsely and bloom only briefly. Thus, in tropical zones information about forage location might be more valuable than in temperate zones.<ref name=\"HoneyDance\">{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00265-003-0726-9 | title=Why do honey bees dance? | year=2004 | vauthors = Dornhaus A, Chittka L | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=55 | issue=4 | pages=395\u2013401}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution ==\n\nAncestors to modern honeybees most likely performed excitatory movements to encourage other nest-mates to forage.

In this algorithm, bee agents travel through network regions called foraging zones. On their way their information on the network state is delivered for updating the local routing tables. BeeHive is fault tolerant, scalable, and relies completely on local, or regional, information, respectively. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that BeeHive achieves a similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</blockquote>\n\nAnother bee-inspired [[stigmergy|stigmergic computational technique]] called [[bee colony optimization]] is employed in Internet Server Optimization.<ref name=\"Nakrani2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1177/105971230401200308| title = On Honey Bees and Dynamic Server Allocation in Internet Hosting Centers | vauthors = Nakrani S, Tovey C | year = 2004| journal = Adaptive Behavior| volume = 12| issue = 3\u20134| pages = 223\u2013240 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.3457 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tovey C  | title = The Honey Bee Algorithm: A Biological Inspired Approach to Internet Server Optimization | journal = Engineering Enterprise | date = Spring 2004 | pages = 13\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Zigbee]] RF protocol is named after the waggle dance.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Animal communication]]\n* [[Bee learning and communication]]\n* [[Grooming dance]]\n* [[Wasps]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Gould JL | title = Honey bee recruitment: the dance-language controversy | journal = Science | volume = 189 | issue = 4204 | pages = 685\u201393 | date = August 1975 | pmid = 1154023 | doi = 10.1126/science.1154023 | authorlink = James L.
